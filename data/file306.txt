3060010 in the ensuing time since the taping i have forged relationships with individuals in that community and these are individuals i genuinely like
3060011 for me it was not a theological or biological debate it was not even a political one it was just the right thing to apologize for causing pain and speaking in condemning words of a fellow human being there was not any concern of losing this seat or winning this seat if i lose the worst case scenario is to go home to raise my five boys and make a ton of money practicing law no i didnt flip flop i evolved it was a growth process

3060069 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
3060070 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
3060071 an important potential reason is that never married men have greater access to social support now than they did in the past it used to be that having a spouse was important for social support and a social network
3060072 if you get married and then divorced that will hurt your health
3060073 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier they didnt look at the quality of an individual marriage but that being married is more likely overall to make you happier than not being married

3060111 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3060118 the false dichotomy between art as a form of social transformation and art as a form of aesthetic enlightenment of aesthetic contemplation
3060119 it was designed essentially to completely destroy any kind of practice that engages with the social because his argument negates the value of many socially based arguments he rescued all those people who didnt know how to react negatively to the onslaught of post structuralist theory to the introduction of institutional critique to the popularity of the collective practices engaged with the political suddenly there was a language that wasnt negative that wasnt overtly racist that wasnt overtly sexist and that was reconstituting the aesthetic and all these very powerful institutions and people latched onto it remember this guy appeared out of nowhere from vegas
3060120 someone said that brecht wanted everyone to think alike i want everyone to think alike but becht wanted to do it through communism in a way russia is doing it under government its happening here all by itself without being under strict government so if its working without trying why cant it work without being communist everybody looks alike and acts alike and were getting more and more that way
3060121 art has many possible manifestations id like the art world or the art community to be as multi dimensional as is its changing truth obviously different things have dominance at different times and it is a continuum that is constantly disrupting and erupting new this evening we have been superficially pitting beauty against social content i would never say beauty is in conflict with social content they arent in conflict nor is there historical evidence to support them being seen as antithetical art is one of the few open spaces in society so it is not in my interests to try to constrain or control other artists necessities

3060142 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy everyone is treated equally which means no knocking anyone back however great the temptation thatll be why australian rock is best known to the outside world for such musical abominations as silverchair the vines and savage garden
3060143 its a really poor piece of journalism from a music writer who once had relevance and influence but now hes living in australia he doesnt really have the knowledge or experience of the local industry to back up his opinions

3060165 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
3060166 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
3060167 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
3060168 you told me more about the process than i know
3060169 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
3060170 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
3060171 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
3060172 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
3060173 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
3060174 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
3060175 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores

3060190 it was just cool as hell we had isaac hayes records hanging around its purely sonic it sounded so good it was just immediately a very cool track
3060191 i would say weve definitely got him to thank because had he not written that tune we wouldnt have sampled it and the basis of the music that you hear is his
3060192 he was an equal cornerstone to the evolution of hip hop whats come to be known as r amp b and urban music in general
3060193 so theres absolutely no doubt that isaac hayes will be truly missed and he was a very influential part of music as we hear it today
3060194 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3060195 after laying the groundwork for the memphis soul sound through his work with stax records his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon
3060196 the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present

3060200 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3060201 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3060202 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3060203 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3060204 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3060205 hopefully this study underlines the importance of how crucial older matriarchs are to the health of elephant populations
3060206 protecting the leaders of elephant herds will be even more important in what may be an increase in droughts due to climate change
3060207 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
3060208 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
3060209 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
3060210 there must be susceptibility factors in the granule neuron precursor cell that predispose it to forming cancer so we now must try to understand what it is about this cell type that makes it susceptible to forming cancer in response to sonic hedgehog signaling this relationship between stem cells and oncogenes suggests a new point of potential therapeutic intervention

3060219 if we evaluate schools that way things change quite a bit as far as which ones we would identify as failing
3060220 when you shift the focus from achievement to impact there are still schools that do very well and some that do poorly
3060221 but they are not necessarily where you think they are there are high impact schools in every kind of neighborhood serving every kind of child the same is true of low impact schools
3060222 by adding primexs capacity to our own weve taken the next step in positioning our firm as a major supplier to the construction industry
3060223 vanguards construction products division will now include shelf support and fenestration products under the vanguard banner and indoor and outdoor hvac building and wire management products under the primex brand
3060224 our parent organization has been engaged in a worldwide strategic review of operations
3060225 as a result of this review hasco decided to concentrate its u s operations on distribution rather than domestic manufacturing
3060226 obviously we are disappointed about the need to reduce our u s workforce
3060227 we remain committed to servicing a growing u s market for our products
3060228 what i propose in conclusion gentlemen is that hustomium is in fact the long sought thirty seventh core element
3060229 and it is this element that will be the catalyst in what will be the greatest advance in science since the industrialization of our great empire
3060230 you sat through my lecture for a damned blade youre obviously very desperate
3060231 its your name isnt it or at least the name i knew you by
3060232 i knew theyd recruit you sooner or later youve got the fastest hands in the empire
3060233 you knew i wouldnt show it to you right off the bat boy i do love to show off all my work if i can
3060234 another of the many uses ive discovered for the powerful energetic properties of hustomium is it ability to render any of the elements weaponizable
3060235 i never understood why you didnt just use a damn steamrifle like everyone else its much simpler
3060236 the steamrifle as an extension of mans idiocy his laziness and fear you taught me that
3060237 you should stop listening to me im old and half crazy the sword is yours if you want it
3060238 ive got enough hustomium coming in to make dozens of those swords i just dont have the time right now
3060239 and there are thirty six pipes feeding into the portal do you see where im going with this
3060240 youre insane you cant combine the core elements youd wipe out half the continent with the violent reaction it would cause
3060241 now try slicing through that block of titanium on the table there
3060242 diamond or not i dont have the power to make a dent in that
3060243 we stand on the edge of the precipice one leap with the lost element as our wings and the sky is no longer the limit humans will reach the stars
3060244 thats impossible youre treading on the gods territory old man
3060245 infinity is but another hurdle placed before us only to push us to jump higher now touch your fingers to the portal youll notice something familiar
3060246 our reality is possibly only one of a likely infinite number of realities
3060247 its my belief that this portal may lead us to another dimension of space and time that completely differs from our own there could be anything on the other side perhaps even an alternate version of our own timeline deviated by only one small change in course from the history we know
3060248 good lord no there are many experiments to complete before id even think of sending a living being across the threshold theres no telling whats on the other side you may find yourself suddenly standing on the sun or in the middle of it
3060249 the rebels do they know you are an imperial scientist
3060250 of course not i have many secret channels to the rogue nation ive never been there myself
3060251 but you realize should the empire find out there will be all out war for possession of the element
3060252 they may already know the truth of your discovery the empire has many hands and many eyes
3060253 you refer to the kura tyrannuum let them come if they kill me the knowledge will be lost forever all my notes are locked safely away here and after i let you out of my lab the doors will not open again until my experiments are complete
3060254 i do not fear the empire even they cannot stop the progress of technology its as unstoppable as the steamsnakes you ride
3060255 i thank you for teaching me all you know master
3060256 no one speaks the name is the assassins circle and lives
3060257 though if we dont win this war it may become the
3060258 is this the cassian empire or not is it the year 3417
3060259 this is germany its year of our lord 1942 and apparently were
3060260 when they closed the door he went to the window and was still yelling
3060261 one of the brothers picked up a small coffee table and threw it at the window in attempt to scare him off
3060262 someone obviously broke the womans window out but that could have been anybody
3060263 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3060264 i think we look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3060265 sends a clear signal that the cftc is on the beat and that our continued and increased cooperation with law enforcement authorities will help put these foreign exchange dealers where they belong in jail
3060266 im pleased it was a very good training session for the lads
3060267 it was a very good workout considering we had four or five main players not there
3060268 we were without roque morten emerton and of course nelsen so the lads who came in did ever so well im very optimistic now
3060269 i said to the lads that the tempo has got to be right youre not going to have it for 90 minutes but you can have it for most of the game
3060270 if you have that tempo where you are getting tight winning the ball and keeping the ball then i wont have any qualms about that
3060271 the performance has got to be right we wont always get the result if we play that way
3060272 but we will get better we will get sharper it is only the first game next week so in the next three or four games we will get sharper and fitter so im optimistic for the new season
3060273 in the first half i thought we were a little bit slow out of the traps but then again we gave them a lot of possession in front of us without them actually creating any chances
3060274 but in the second half we came out and we started ever so well the tempo and everything
3060275 we were getting tight and stopping them from playing the way they wanted to play forcing them into a lot of errors

3060279 u s coast guard and police officers have nabbed 24 vessels packed with contraband in pacific coastal waters off southern california since october 1 2007 more than twice the number stopped during the same period of the previous year
3060280 aside from defying border security authorities say the smugglers risk the lives of their passengers many of whom are nonswimmers whom they take miles out to sea often in poorly equipped and badly maintained boats in one incident in march a launch crammed with 14 mexicans and a salvadoran broke down and drifted for two days before a coast guard crew picked them up some were reported to be dehydrated and suffering sunburn
3060281 in the 362 days the voluntary flights were offered during 2004 2007 the bodies of 342 illegal immigrants were discovered along arizonas stretch of the u s mexico border nearly one per day southern arizona medical examiners records show the yearly totals recorded by the u s border patrol show that the number of border deaths each year since the program started in 2004 has been higher than in any of the previous years taking just the number of bodies handled by the pima county medical examiner and comparing 2001 2003 before the repatriation program started the number of bodies found hasnt decreased

3060291 the wii third party game story is not a pretty one
3060292 the proposal of high price increases and more water meters combined with the rising cost of energy bills could hurt many households
3060293 london has some of the countrys poorest areas and the government needs to seriously consider ways to help those who cannot afford to pay for their water
3060294 thames customers have enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years but we now need to make essential investment to secure their services for the future
3060295 consumers are likely to see significantly different bills depending on whether they are metered or not with unmetered customers being harder hit than metered customers
3060296 against this background and in line with general economic trends increased problems with customer debt will emerge as an issue for the water industry
3060297 while we expect to see the many water companies increase their funding for schemes to assist vulnerable customers who will have difficulty meeting these proposed increases they are also likely to increase their efforts to collect from customers who can pay but wont and to target unbilled properties
3060298 the review of water company prices presents a real opportunity for water companies to deliver environmental improvements to benefit people and wildlife

3060307 this collaboration with naturalpoint further demonstrates our commitment to bring high quality 3d and animation to the masses
3060308 additionally it showcases the power and versatility that daz studio offers motion capture suites traditionally cost tens of thousands of dollars but now arenas compatibility with our free software application offers users a cost effective solution without sacrificing animation display quality
3060309 one of naturalpoints main goals is to make motion capture more accessible
3060310 daz 3d shares a similar vision and with the new arena plug in for daz studio the dream of inexpensive and efficient animation and modeling can be realized
3060311 when the boundaries of costs imagination and vehicle design have no limits it is amazing what drivers would want to have in their cars if they had a complete freedom choice regarding its specification and could leave the conventional options behind however it is encouraging that drivers still regard tyres as a key safety component of their vehicle which are often neglected as many take to the road to go on holiday
3060312 these new additions to the shell online line up provide consumers with an experience thats both entertaining and informative
3060313 not only do we enjoy providing shell customers with interactive games and giveaways but its also important for motorists to stay informed to ensure they are making smart decisions at the pump
3060314 in the most difficult capital market conditions in recent history we are pleased that perseus and our co investors have recognized the excellent work done by our talented team led by mark hogan our ceo the strong demand for our vehicles and the strength of our strategic partnerships their commitments will provide the resources needed by vpg to move into production
3060315 i am delighted to join the team at nissan and to have the opportunity of developing our uk presence with the most extensive range of high quality commercial vehicles on the market
3060316 light commercial vehicles will play a central role in nissans planned growth over the next five years and tonys experience of developing and implementing strategies for cv growth will prove invaluable as we endeavour to take the lcv business forward
3060317 the importance of lcvs has been raised within nissan and reflecting this tony will sit on the nissan gb management board this is the first time commercial vehicles has been placed at the heart of the business
3060318 to deliver growth through the combination of multiple new product launches and the further development of our lcv distribution strategy and network
3060319 we welcome the decision made by boris johnson to take a hard line with illegal taxi touts we hope that other councils if not done so already quickly follow suit
3060320 removing touts from our streets is a step in the right direction to ensure that everyone can feel safe when they travel by taxi its important that people using a taxi late at night can hire one with complete confidence the best way to do this is to hail an instantly recognisable london style taxi or to book a private hire vehicle in advance using a reputable firm
3060321 we are quite pleased with our performance this past quarter
3060322 we have delivered another strong quarter and we see exciting times ahead on the back of our successful private placement of 3 5 million shares closed on june 24 we were able to complete the acquisition of weihai hengda electric motor co ltd which added a third major product line rotary motors to our product portfolio
3060323 our current major focus at hengda is to ensure that its management team has all the support and resources necessary to complete the existing supply contracts for the year which should grow revenues and earnings by 30 over 2007 next we will gradually improve manufacturing efficiency and optimize product mix by bringing in new technologies and developing higher grade new products over the next few years to this effect a special team led by our chief technology officer mr okawa will conduct a thorough study of manufacturing processes and technologies at hengda identify opportunities issue recommendations and assist with the execution of the plan
3060324 in shanghai the construction of the main building of our new facility has been completed
3060325 core production lines and equipment have arrived and we are scheduled to conduct equipment adjusting and testing and start trial runs with all our people in shanghai moving in to the new facility on october 15 while we have been a bit delayed we are working hard to meet our commitment to our major north american customer magna international inc to have a minimum capacity of 1 million units ready at shanghai by december this year we have scheduled three micro motor lines to be produced at shanghai for magna these micro motors including applications for car seats door locks and engines have all been successfully developed and validated by magna we estimate that the market potential for these micro motors could reach a total of 500 million for the next four years
3060326 our tower type oil pump project for daqing oil field is on track with 39 units completed in the first quarter and 80 in the second quarter we expect to complete 200 units for the whole year
3060327 our linear motor driven subway train project progressed quite well i am pleased to report that the subway line between beijing airport and the city started to operate successfully before the beijing olympic games this is a clear validation and recognition by the government of the application of the linear motor technology to urban mass transportation in china i am confident that the development process of chinas own linear motor driven subway train will be accelerated and i expect that it will move to a new stage after the beijing olympics
3060328 with a well established multi faceted growth strategy and multiple projects under way i believe that harbin electric is ideally positioned to capture market opportunities and continuously deliver solid results
3060329 this impressive residual value is critical in the highly competitive fleet market as the more the car is worth in three or four years time the lower the monthly contract hire costs whether business or personal leasing this also spells good news for retail buyers who are purchasing the car on personal contract purchases pcp
3060330 the volvo xc90 has returned very good residual values since its launch and we feel the xc60 will continue in this same vein
3060331 the 4x4 market has been under pressure from used prices falling for a while but the xc60 is a premium product with very modern styling and a good level of standard specification and we are confident of its success as a used car
3060332 about 50 of the experience is the thrill of getting on the road and on the track with 40 other fellow muscle car nuts
3060333 but the other 50 is about what happens out of the cars access to unique venues winemaker dinners every night seeing your car on display muscle car 1000 combines raw automotive excitement with luxurious living
3060334 i created muscle car 1000 because there was nothing like it a really fun car rally that caters to the upscale lifestyle that last part was my wifes idea and it was a good one
3060335 muscle car 1000 is making a real difference in one of the worlds poorest countries
3060336 our second quarter produced exceptional results from our manitex product line against the backdrop of a north american capital equipment market still challenged by lack luster demand and rising material costs
3060337 our backlog continues to rise with global demand for our products particularly our 50 ton and other high capacity cranes and we are particularly encouraged by the 22 year to date increase in our crane backlog this year we have received in excess of 130 orders for our 50 ton crane since its launch a year ago on the materials handling side we have responded to the more difficult market conditions by commencing a streamlining of our operations and will continue to prudently position ourselves so that we are prepared when this market finds firmer footing
3060338 we now have good visibility into orders and our expected performance for the remainder of the year and expect to see financial benefits materialize from our international distribution agreements in the second half of 2008 and into 2009 for 2009 we anticipate at least 10 of our revenues will come from our international diversification with our new distributors who sell into the oil gas and mining markets particularly within russia the c i s and the middle east we believe that we can maintain the sales momentum with our large capacity cranes and the profitability that we demonstrated this quarter throughout this year and into 2009 based on our greater visibility we would expect our continuing operations revenues for 2008 to be in the 100 110 million range with diluted eps in a range of 0 30 0 40 representing growth of 30 percent to 74 percent from 2007
3060339 against the backdrop of an industry that has seen a significant decline during 2008 we are pleased with our performance to date and with the 16 increase we have seen in our consolidated backlog however the second quarter financials do not fully articulate the enthusiasm we have right now with respect to the opportunities directly in front of us the strength of our crane business is moving us forward and our expectation is that we will see continued growth in this group as we increase production and manage the supply chain to deliver our larger cranes to our global markets this growth will be combined with expected profitability improvements from the streamlining that is underway in the material handling group that should help these operations to be properly positioned when these markets recover increasing material costs and supply chain shortages are challenges we are working on together with a stronger focus on inventory management we have recently announced a price increase for our crane products due to the rapid material inflation over the first half of the year and continue to pursue sourcing opportunities to help offset these cost increases certain key materials are also under supply pressure which has a disruptive impact on production and inventory levels and we have initiated actions internally and with our suppliers to progressively address these good progress was made during the quarter regarding our international expansion plans that form a key part of our overall growth strategy and which will provide some cushion against the slow north american economy we obtained russian certification on our larger cranes and have shipped a 50 ton crane to our newly appointed russian distributor that they will demonstrate at the conexpo russia trade show in moscow in september where we will also have a presence we have now announced two international distribution agreements and we continue to aggressively pursue partnerships and distribution around the globe to participate in the appropriate growth markets
3060340 legal epistemology is ninety per cent quantitative the other half is qualitative
3060341 for any given false acquittal for a serious crime we can anticipate gt 4 violent crimes that would have been prevented during the time the offender would otherwise have been incarcerated had the legal system not decided to let the guilty felon out of its clutches either by explicit acquittal or by a dropping or dismissal of charges against him of those four serious crimes 0 1 will be a homicide 0 2 will be rapes and 3 7 will be armed robbery or aggravated assault
3060342 no seas gandalla y paga para que todo el mundo vea tus babosadas
3060343 legal epistemology is ninety per cent quantitative the other half is qualitative
3060344 when conflicting points of view clash in a public forum neither side has a first amendment right to speak without interruption and the police must allow the competing groups to compete unless and until there are fighting words imminent violence or other serious threat to public safety
3060345 once fighting words have been uttered the police can intervene to the extent necessary to defuse the situation and prevent a breach of the peace
3060346 but that cannot be right because a non exclusive permit to use some portion of a public forum does not automatically grant control over all speech in that space
3060347 thus if the gay pride parade has a permit to march down main street police can prevent anti gay rights group from protesting too loudly on the sidewalks along the parade route

3060355 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3060356 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3060357 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3060358 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3060359 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3060360 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3060366 i understand this is your birthday weve come to celebrate
3060367 how much different will things be for iraq as a result of today
3060368 will the insurgents have a less receptive hiding place will ieds become less frequent will the children of this town be more likely to have a future with less hatred
3060369 i heard you yelling and i wasnt going to let go
3060370 deliberately and courageously exposed himself to enemy fire in order to prevent the enemy from assaulting through the kill zone and overwhelming his convoy

3060376 i had my husband alive and in front of me
3060377 i could see his face and touch his skin he was real what more could i possibly ask for
3060378 the president says mom and the troops are doing such a good job and we need to stay here a little longer
3060379 do i feel bad about apologizing for the army hell no

3060385 the discussion between the two parties were frank and positive they discussed the progress made by iraq and especially that of the iraqi governments success in security and the future reconstruction projects
3060386 we are making a donation of one million naira to the university because we in abupaa believe that we have a social responsibility to play at the larger university level and another five hundred thousand naira for the associations use to advance the cause of the institution at large
3060387 the circular from the national salary incomes and wages commission in the presidency was clear on the issue
3060388 im more than happy to have you in the program
3060389 are conducting an operation to prevent firing on south ossetia and on russian peacekeepers by georgian artillery and the regrouping of georgian forces aimed at new aggression towards south ossetia
3060390 russian forces have occupied the senaki military base which was abandoned
3060391 worrying about self esteem is a waste of time if youre in this business or want to be in this business to be liked youre in the wrong business because youll either turn out brilliant work and everyone will be jealous of you or youll turn out crap and everyone will think its crap its not worth worrying about dont care what other people think about your work and you can easily keep working
3060392 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided

3060394 its balance in the battle between free form and format
3060395 quite frankly 4g represents a great opportunity for us because we see that as capacity expansion higher data rates imply capacity expansion not just combining speed and download capability
3060396 so i think overall we see it as kind of wait and see and if market trends shift and change then thats something that will be easily accessible to us
3060397 i think the world is going there the world phone will be a reality
3060398 i think youll see some interesting developments here over the next six to twelve months
3060399 de heerser over de russische aarde is steeds de rus dit was zo en zal steeds zo zijn

3060404 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3060405 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3060406 we are here to continue recovering natural resources and the consolidation of nationalization
3060407 the democratic and cultural revolution undertaken by the brotherly bolivian people
3060408 the results tell us that the situation wont change there are no conditions for an end to the crisis
3060409 its not that they are naughty illegal or even nerdish its just that any glimpse inside his head could be worth billions
3060410 particularly so now the wii still sells strongly around the world but its successor is the talking point unfortunately the only place where the discussion has any grounding is inside mr miyamotos head
3060411 i felt i wasnt safe and that meant that my family wasnt safe
3060412 when i arrived here i went to the office of the un high commissioner for refugees unhcr and talked to them about my case but i had no proof that i had worked with the us army
3060413 a year later i lost the hope to start over things werent moving and i wondered what i could do
3060414 we dont have any statistics but we consider there are between 400 000 and 450 000 refugees from iraq here
3060415 jordans population of five million has grown by 750 000 with the arrival of the iraqi refugees
3060416 most refugees want to go home most dont want to go somewhere new and restart their lives
3060417 at this time most iraqis in jordan dont see a situation where they can return and some will never ever be able to go back
3060418 i put the name of the american commanding officer i worked with at al waleed in google and i couldnt believe it when i found him and saw his picture
3060419 if it werent for you many of my soldiers would have died
3060420 we feel its our nations responsibility to help ivraa is a way to correct some mistakes
3060421 i feel a bit responsible as a former military officer for some of the displacement of iraqis
3060422 based on the documents presented to them they believe salah qualifies for the special immigration visa because its been shown he served as an interpreter for coalition forces
3060423 now in the streets of jordan i walk like this
3060424 for demanding lifting of an economic blockade we get bullets while hindu fanatics who are attacking muslims in jammu and setting their property on fire are allowed to do whatever they want
3060425 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
3060426 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
3060427 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
3060428 a convoy of vehicles was attacked by a suicide bomber i believe it hit one of the vehicles in the convoy it is an armoured vehicle
3060429 we carried out the suicide bombing in kabul against foreign forces
3060430 with an economic advantage it would not have had under normal market conditions
3060431 was paid 326 414 euros in five months or 2 170 euros a day
3060432 was paid 1 536 million euros equal to 6 400 euros a day while alitalia lost 626 million euros
3060433 immediate economic and humanitarian assistance to help mitigate the impact the invasion has had on the people of georgia
3060434 in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3060435 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the us and europe
3060436 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3060437 whatever tensions and hostilities might have existed between georgians and ossetians they in no way justify moscows path of violent aggression

3060440 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3060441 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3060442 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3060443 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3060444 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3060445 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3060446 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3060447 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3060448 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3060449 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3060450 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3060451 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3060452 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3060453 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3060455 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3060456 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers
3060457 the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3060458 in our view this approach makes no sense as a matter of law or policy
3060459 be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3060460 the court is not unsympathetic to tiffany and other rights owners it is the trademark owners burden to police its mark and companies like ebay cannot be held liable for trademark infringement based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their websites
3060461 we do not believe the law allows auction sites like ebay to continue to turn a blind eye to this problem while reaping profits from the listing and sale of counterfeit merchandise
3060462 stated trademark law does not impose a duty on tiffany to police ebays site ebay designed the site and has the responsibility to police it
3060463 had they attacked that pipeline three weeks ago oil could have been up 5
3060464 but from a supply and demand standpoint the market doesnt seem that concerned partially because the dollar is much stronger and because demand doesnt look insatiable

3060487 consumers increasing desire to access social applications such as facebook on their cell phones coupled with flat rate pricing plans will give carriers the opportunity to capitalize on this revenue shift

3060524 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
3060525 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
3060526 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
3060527 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado

3060530 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3060531 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3060532 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

3060535 these characters are not people they are so far above the normal civilians because thats the tone of the game
3060536 we really wanted the classes to be archetypal and we wanted them to stand out from the world as a stark contrast
3060537 world of warcraft was very efficient with the number of models that they made we were not
3060538 its pretty expensive for us art wise because of the way we do our classes and the way we do a lot of the weaponry we create
3060539 and essentially doing different genders adds a lot of model artwork world of warcraft was very smart about how they chose their class models and their npcs because they were very efficient with the number of models that they made we were not
3060540 for me it was always a no brainer to have gender choice
3060541 theres so much interest as to guys who plays girls or girls who play guys sometimes its assumed that people play their own gender but a lot of the times people dont its obviously a really important choice that we want people to be able to make on their own
3060542 the problem with doing the differences between genders is that one or the other will be perceived to be better
3060543 no we give specific timing on animation and abilities so that theyre exactly the same
3060544 the problem with doing the differences between genders is that one or the other will be perceived to be better whether thats true or not we still may be perceived as having some kind of gender bias probably in favor of men
3060545 although i think if we were to favor gender most of us would probably favor female
3060546 but yeah its an aesthetic choice and i think thats where it needs to stay

3060561 it isnt life that matters its the courage you bring to it
3060562 lets say for the sake of example a couple players got 25mm 50mm or whatever a year pay and they play on teams that just dominate
3060563 not only would that be a great revenue source for all the teams involved but it would create a huge economic incentive for the other 24nba teams and all overseas team to become top tier teams then of course we could create our own world cup type tournament every 4 years all of this could open the door to create more nba owned competition im not saying it would be easy or automatic quite a few parties that dont always see eye to eye would have to come to agreement but the timing for all of that is right and its an amazing opportunity for players leagues and teams alike

3060578 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3060579 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia

3060789 those who have warned that russia is an unpredictable partner were proven right

3060794 one must not hurry on such serious issues as serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
3060795 there has not been a properly worded public official statement that would tell them russia clearly that they have to stop and they risk their future relationship with the eu if they dont

3060838 for too long the federal government has tied the hands of state governments that wish to permit oil and natural gas leasing in their adjacent offshore zones congress should remove the moratoria on offshore gas production and share the federal royalties with the states that decide to allow offshore production just as they share the royalties from production on federal lands with the states

3060908 we feel without that our history is being cut short
3060909 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
3060910 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
3060911 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
3060912 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
3060913 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community

3060915 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for

3060938 whether its apathy confusion or just plain denial homeowners seem to believe the housing crisis affects every other home but not my house underscoring a wide gap between homeowners inflated perception of their home values and the gloomy market reality
3060939 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
3060940 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
3060941 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
3060942 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
3060943 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
3060944 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
3060945 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
3060946 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
3060947 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
3060948 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
3060949 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
3060950 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
3060951 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
3060952 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
3060953 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
3060954 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
3060955 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
3060956 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
3060957 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
3060958 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
3060959 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
3060960 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
3060961 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
3060962 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
3060963 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
3060964 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
3060965 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
3060966 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
3060967 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
3060968 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
3060969 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
3060970 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
3060971 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make

3060978 while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia
3060979 the precedent of kosovo is a terrible precedent which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations developed not over decades but over centuries

3060986 capsicum spray is used on a daily routine basis and it wont be long until the same happens with tasers its going to be misused with no consequence for police
3060987 it saves a lot of drama it saves a lot of lives it saves having to pull out guns
3060988 theyre not to be used as compliance tools you use them to prevent injury it might be someone threatening suicide or hurting someone else or even attacking police you dont use them to stop people playing up
3060989 police may use a taser when a person is an imminent threat to a police officer or member of the public but when use of a firearm is not warranted
3060990 it is generally classed on the same level as capsicum spray it is effective on people affected by alcohol drugs rage or in an unstable mental state
3060991 we asked the police to modify the policy on the drive stun mode to make it very clear how police officers can use it
3060992 we actually havent seen a final draft of their report

3060995 except in extreme circumstances where there is no other reasonable option to avoid the imminent risk of injury
3060996 the wording reflects the fact that while use in these instances is not ideal there may still be circumstances where a taser is still the most appropriate use of force option
3060997 if it is identified that the weapon is being used inappropriately there are a range of guidance training and disciplinary options that may be used
3060998 there continues to be considerable debate about their use and our decision now does not stop us from considering them in the future
3060999 we will continue to look at what the market produces and watch closely the experience of other states that have introduced them
3061000 clearly if a taser is used as an alternative to shooting someone dead then that is one thing
3061001 if on the other hand a taser was used to repeatedly fire into someone for the purpose of eliciting information then obviously thats a different situation
3061002 in interviews where they want information they will use that taser as a torture instrument to get what they want to hear out of people
3061003 i used a bit of experience this time and i did absolutely nothing in the last couple of days i did a bit of running but until then i had a lot of rest
3061004 i did swimming and fishing and not much else i thought maybe the physios wouldnt agree with me and tell me i should have done something but i was resting and i dont feel a thing now
3061005 i am just happy that i stayed fit all through pre season i have run more than i ever have and i feel fit i fish on the river in the czech republic
3061006 it was my first goal in pre season and i dont think i have scored a lot in training either so for me it was good and for the team it was important as well we didnt want to lose and although we wanted really to win we fought back so it was good
3061007 they were a good side it was very difficult but we tried out a couple of formations and every player that the gaffer wanted to play played
3061008 i dont know whats wrong with neil clement but overall the game was a bonus and 1 1 against a very good side is a good result
3061009 now we have one last week to make sure we are ready for the arsenal game
3061010 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3061011 lara is strong athletic confident and obviously very attractive she has everything a man would want from a woman and everything a woman would aspire to be like im really looking forward to playing the part
3061012 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
3061013 the lord of the rings the return of the king
3061014 but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3061015 unfortunately in 1888 hewitt was defeated by the old tammany favorite
3061016 the new mayor an ignorant and unprincipled son of a saloon keeper was given social recognition asked to dinner in the best circles and opened a ball with mrs
3061017 if i dont prove a good mayor it will be because i dont know how
3061018 grant may be the only person who fought against parks who nonetheless has a park named after him
3061019 it seemed so weird last time we spoke you admitted to a lifelong fear of condiments i dont want to get you upset
3061020 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3061021 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
3061022 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3061023 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
3061024 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3061025 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
3061026 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
3061027 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
3061028 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
3061029 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3061030 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3061031 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3061032 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3061033 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3061034 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3061035 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3061036 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3061037 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3061038 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3061039 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3061040 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3061041 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3061042 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3061043 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3061044 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience

3061048 there is little difference in people but that little difference makes a big difference the little difference is attitude the big difference is whether it is positive or negative

3061064 writing in the ieee spectrum james oberg analyzes whether there was in fact a significant risk to humans from the satellite which the us military shot down on 21 february purportedly to head off the possibility of its splashing a half ton of toxic hydrazine fuel somewhere on earth previous experts had scoffed at the rationale put forth pointing out that there was trivial possibility that any significant amount of toxic fuel would make it to the ground intact obergs analysis titled the inside story and claims that indeed its possible and even likely that there could be a danger to the ground unfortunately the analysis is full of flaws and lack of rigor indeed lacking any sort of numerical reasoning it seems to be too much repeating official spin and could have used a hefty dose of skepticism and could also use a little bit of actual analysis using numbers rather than handwaving
3061065 heres the first number that oberg should have quoted 32 megajoules per kilogram
3061066 the hydrazine tank is a 1 meter sphere containing about 400 liters of hydrazine the stated hazard area is about 2 hectares something like 1 10 000 000 000 of the area under the orbit
3061067 yeah we could have shot it down but the odds were so small it wasnt worth the money our bad

3061076 alasan utama dari kekalahan itu adalah mentalitas yang kami miliki kala turun lapangan kami masih sering melakukan kesalahan yang sama dalam tiga tahun terakhir ini ini tentu membuat saya terganggu dan harus mencari solusinya

3061080 law enforcement operations like this should reassure the public that ice is committed to putting public safety first every individual targeted as part of this operation has a criminal record
3061081 criminal aliens should be on notice that ice is working closely with local law enforcement to take off the streets those who threaten the very safety of our neighborhoods
3061082 we appreciate the efforts of immigration and customs enforcement in its efforts to remove illegal individuals with extensive criminal records from our community
3061083 indicative of the ability of the agencies to work cooperatively together to achieve a common goal of public safety in our community
3061084 i would like to commend and thank all the law enforcement agencies on the local state and federal level who participated in this effort gang related activities and those who choose to partake in them do so knowing full well the negative impact their actions can have on the neighborhoods throughout our fine city we hope this weeks arrests will call attention to our never ending commitment to combat suppress and prevent future gang related behavior

3061089 together with the bombs falling on georgian cities the hope for a normal neighbor in the east has been ruined
3061090 those who have warned that russia is an unpredictable partner were proven right
3061091 russia is driven by neo imperial ambitions and unable to treat neighbors especially those who had been in its sphere of influence as partners
3061092 restoring russian control over the former soviet union irrespective of what those countries want which is why this is so reminiscent of the episodes in prague in 1968 and budapest in 1956
3061093 the russian attacks against georgia unavoidably confront us with the task of reviewing several aspects of current cooperation between the eu and russia
3061094 russias military strikes in georgia toll a knell for many of europes hopes such as the possibility of sharing common fundamental values with russia
3061095 one must not hurry on such serious issues as serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
3061096 there has not been a properly worded public official statement that would tell them russia clearly that they have to stop and they risk their future relationship with the eu if they dont

3061143 we wanted to make sure that the website reflected all of the latest data and information that was available about this topic
3061144 i think the emphasis in the earlier text was a little strong todays vehicles are more efficient when it comes to smog emissions
3061145 our concern is that municipal decision making must be based on facts and scientific evidence
3061146 and we were seeing some municipalities that were focusing on the health impacts of idling based on information that was incorrect and misleading
3061147 what i would like to see is that natural resources canada put the same amount of emphasis on these other driving behaviours that they do on idling
3061148 its gonna make it harder for every city politician to make the argument that we need to have restrictive legislation on idling its not good news for cities anywhere
3061149 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
3061150 i think they knew that history was being made tonight
3061151 obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
3061152 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
3061153 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
3061154 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt
3061155 so i think that it will be good for us
3061156 you just had to smile because you couldnt write it any better
3061157 what you do is you keep your fingers crossed hold your breath and hope nothing happens bucks general manager
3061158 that is a part of having a player playing at this time of the year playing at that competitive level there is no doubt wear and tear that will come along with that
3061159 i hate the fact that we lie to ourselves and pretend this is about representing country
3061160 our approach to it is they need to know their bodies said
3061161 they need to understand our season is a long grueling season coach
3061162 if the commissioner and he has stated it on numerous occasions wants it to be a worldwide game weve got to have our players participating in worldwide events
3061163 can you imagine what thoughts are going through carlos boozers and deron williams heads walking into that stadium for the opening ceremonies the main thing is theyve earned the right to be on that team and we recognize that we look at it as an opportunity for them to compete
3061164 thats why youre leaving youre jump shot short youre worn out from the olympics but how do you say to a player ok andrei dont carry the olympic torch for russia
3061165 franchise guys for their homelands the nba players end up doing much of the heavy lifting
3061166 its very safe to say that the usa team is also the deepest team hammond said
3061167 you look at a team like germany i know they have some good players but dirk still is
3061168 the usa team who do you go to it might be kobe it might be lebron it might be wade in certain situations
3061169 it can be tough on an individual like dirk hes an extreme maybe the most extreme example
3061170 we all have to accept that and live with it
3061171 you have those three thats correct in what order it is too early to tell i think the kickers will have a lot to say about it who they feel the most comfortable with
3061172 it is probably the deepest position on our team right now and so it is a great situation to be in we have worked for four years to build our interior because we think that is where championships are won
3061173 its very frustrating because it seems every year that my progression as a quarterback has been halted by injury
3061174 maintaining a facility around salmon street springs that attracts people throughout the year and can serve as an anchor for that part of the park a successful attraction will maintain a consistent flow of visitors to the park at different times of the day the week and the year
3061175 for those workers who can work the way to a secure retirement is to keep working until 66
3061176 retirees in 2030 will have to work two to four years longer to maintain todays level of replacement income
3061177 i think its very important to tell your employer that you plan to work for a long time
3061178 one should wait at least a week if not a month before making the decision to retire after a bad event
3061179 if youre really healthy and work is kind of ok then it really makes sense for you to choose a target retirement age and put blinders on to events that might buffet you

3061198 enable known who recommended harm reduction interventions to be delivered and used in a safe environment with the aim of reaching the most marginalized and vulnerable
3061199 a llowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is a form of harm addition
3061200 there are already people saying injection sites arent enough that true harm reduction is giving out heroin for free

3061204 it is the most ambitious public health undertaking of my life time and it was something that was done against the wisdom of the time we can take that and build on what we have done with aids and what we can do with primary care

3061206 we hear at this conference maybe stronger than ever before the need for positive leadership the need for youth leadership the need for civil society leadership
3061207 up until now it has been government leadership politicians the u n and scientists we shouldnt bear that leadership we should play a part but not take it
3061208 we have to make sure that countries stick to their commitments for instance on universal access
3061209 we have to tell the g8 to walk the talk to stick to their commitments but we also have to be willing to talk to the vatican we have to be vocal on issues to have courage to discuss sensitive issues talk about drug use homophobia moral issues gender violence
3061210 youd need a drug that would have a fantastic side effect profile in other words none

3061258 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3061259 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3061260 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3061261 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3061262 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3061263 its like putting eight dogs in a cage then letting them out and then throwing them right back in the cage

3061270 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3061271 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3061272 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3061430 focusing on one possible distraction could very well create a false sense of security
3061431 it would be most effective to look at all the possible problems that can arise in situations that drivers could be confronted with and deal with them comprehensively
3061432 that i think is what pushed us over to decide that its not a question of handsfree or hand held
3061433 its just a question of talking on a cell phone
3061434 to take into account the studies that conclude that it is a distraction and to ignore those that would conclude the contrary doesnt do the whole debate justice
3061435 to look at one potential behavior and highlight it and ignore dozens of others that are extremely common is not dealing with this situation as effectively as it could be
3061436 the company could declare force majeure on its exports from the two ports

3061447 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it has about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
3061448 the historical anomaly of dioceses that have nothing to do with the black community going all the way back to africa to make these relationships
3061449 nationally the list of prominent black clergy supporting the right of lesbians and gays to marry has grown exponentially over past several years to include among others rev
3061450 yes thats right the pastor whose comments were inaccurately portrayed by the media as being unpatriotic and then used by presidential candidate sen barack obamas opponents to distract voters is and has been a supporter for equal rights of lesbian and gay couples that somehow was missed in all of the criticism being hurled at wright

3061494 there comes a time when your body tells you its time to pack up professional sport i worked as hard as i have ever done on my fitness last winter but little niggles keep occuring
3061495 i never at any point thought i never wanted to play
3061496 i think the finality of it just kind of hits you brett favres not going to be our quarterback anymore
3061497 on march 3 when i made that announcement i was not committed 100 percent
3061498 they wanted an answer at that time no one one held a gun to my head but i was honest at that time i was not 100 percent committed
3061499 i knew a month later i may be i didnt know but i knew there was a good chance i would want to play again
3061500 i think its very realistic and we will cater the program and the learning
3061501 hes been working incredibly hard obviously he has a busy schedule him and offensive coordinator brian schottenheimer have been spending a lot of time together and well take it in chunks
3061502 with training camp you dont ever use all the stuff from training camp in any given game i think its very realistic for him to be able to learn what he needs to know
3061503 we needed to increase our workforce by almost 80 percent in a calendar year
3061504 we never would have been able to meet our customer demand without programs to train workers in a very short period of time no worker left behind gave us the opportunity to work with lcc in developing and implementing tailored training programs allowing us to hire 530 workers for these new jobs
3061505 i found out its a lot harder to weld the thicker materials that demmer uses
3061506 it was a pretty smooth transition had i not had that support i know i couldnt have done it nearly as smooth as it went
3061507 weve got great companies who are hiring and weve got people out here who want to go to work
3061508 its really about taking that person and giving them the skills the employer requires
3061509 its no longer simply adequate to say i want to work i can show up on time they arent going to hire just nice people weve got to focus on the skills
3061510 well i cant really cause then i wouldnt be able to get a hold of you

3061536 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
3061537 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
3061538 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
3061539 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3061540 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
3061541 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
3061542 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
3061543 we commenced this yearly operations in october 2007 knowingly fully well that the best time to work is during rainy season
3061544 we did a study of the excess that nigerians are spending annually in terms of annual maintenance cost we discovered it is an average of n90 000 over and above what we should be spending
3061545 if an average of n90 000 excess expenditure in this country and you put it on n5 million vehicles what that amounts to is about n450 billion therefore if nigerians only put down n10 000 against the average spending of n 90 000 per annum that means we will be able to put together about n45 billion just to maintain the road networks and when you put that n10 billion to actually improve the road network you will be saving n3 00 for every n1 00 that you put upward we need to see the road network not just as a service that government must provide but as something that we nigerians have to take up and participate in because no matter the way we look at it government will never be able to maintain the roads holistically though if we have more funding we will be able to provide better road network in the country
3061546 because if we find money to use in protecting what you did on that road then it becomes valuable
3061547 i have travelled wide and know that the countrys police command is yet to be there as far as welfare package is concerned security is number one when it comes to considerations for investment in china one industrialist once told me how scared he was to visit nigeria saying that he hears and reads about rampant killing and mugging that shows how the issue of security ranks in the minds of foreigners
3061548 politicians are extremely corrupt that is why they dont want to do anything positively in this regard the same way money meant to stabilize electricity supply in this country ended up in private pockets of very few people that is how they dont care so these are areas we need to address but that corruption is what is also affecting the police
3061549 today after fridays big advance some pullback is only normal
3061550 innovests ratings are an indicator of a companys performance on intangible value drivers and management quality this information is used to support an investors existing financial knowledge of a company it is widely accepted among investors that extra financial information is now required to get a full understanding of a companys prospects

3061562 a repo man spends his life getting into tense situations
3061563 i think thats very important that we stand unified the community sees us as unified and the administration sees us as unified
3061564 i think its going to start the climate of the year off with low morale and kind of a sense of distrust between the teachers and the administration
3061565 we know the monies are there and if theyre not there where did they go to
3061566 weve got an administration here thats paid well above the state average were spending a huge amount of money on buying buildings but were not paying the teachers
3061567 were paying teachers below the trend line for the whole state of indiana which is a shame
3061568 ive got programs after school id like to do with kids but were not going to do them
3061569 the morale of the teachers is at the bottom and that cant help but hurt the kids
3061570 at the time it seemed entirely the right thing to do
3061571 people said it was going to save us a lot of money when the incinerator was built
3061572 ten years later it doesnt look like that sort of deal at all
3061573 my son is a hard working sporty and very outgoing teenager who has aspirations to become a police officer in the future

3061578 that wealthy countries should commit to spend seven tenths of one percent of their gdp to address world poverty
3061579 the wine index may have done better than the s amp p but so have a lot of things and with wine theres a helluva temptation to just drink it
3061580 if you dont know what youre doing you could get seriously burned
3061581 the majority of wine collectors have no intention of liquidating therefore i dont consider it an investment
3061582 the wine business could never be like a bubble because there are too many true consumers and there is too much consumption
3061583 investing in liquid assets uncorking profits in todays global wine markets
3061584 if you believe in the increase in global wealth and if you believe there are going to be more wealthy people drinking expensive bordeaux then investing in wine is a way to buy into that equation
3061585 with globalization and the expansion of wealth whether were in a recession or not rare wine is in demand all over the world
3061586 just imagine what a share of google would be worth if every night there was less of it
3061587 drinking the wine is absolutely essential because if no one is drinking the price will not continue to appreciate
3061588 wine to me is like jewelry you buy it because you like it you dont buy it with an eye toward resale
3061589 unless you know exactly what youre doing wine as an investment is a crapshoot
3061590 with stocks and bonds at least you dont have to know how to store them
3061591 it reminds me of stock trading in the 1950s when the certificates had to be delivered to the buyers
3061592 in theory theres no real reason to move the wine because it could easily be stored in a central warehouse or series of centralized warehouses which is the case with other commodities
3061593 the yankees and all the other teams with 200 million dollar payrolls
3061594 nej det er dem alle sammen og det siger m rkeligt
3061595 when it comes to the challenges of ownership i think that decentralization of ec aid is an important factor decentralization to the delegations so that the dialogue can take place on a level where the partnership is taking place and that goes for all the member states but certainly for the governments and the civil society and that is something for what we have to work stronger for the decentralization of the delegations

3061598 this proposed rule is nothing but a solution in search of a problem
3061599 the changes would invite excessive and abusive lawsuits against public companies and hurt u s global competitiveness
3061600 the proposal would encourage the same abusive litigation that is threatening the integrity and efficiency of our legal system the litigious nature of the u s markets have put us at a competitive disadvantage vis vis other markets
3061601 excessive litigation generally or securities class actions specifically as a significant threat to the competitiveness of our capital markets
3061602 if theres one thing we dont need more of its abusive lawsuits
3061603 adopting these proposals would add uncertainty complexity new liability and a great deal of cost while compelling companies to provide potentially unreliable immaterial and privileged information about pending litigation
3061604 in our view this approach makes no sense as a matter of law or policy
3061605 sends a clear signal that the cftc is on the beat and that our continued and increased cooperation with law enforcement authorities will help put these foreign exchange dealers where they belong in jail
3061606 once they admit him to seton hall then were going to apply for the waiver
3061607 julian transferred to be closer to his home for personal reasons which he wishes to keep private
3061608 this was considered by the ncaa along with his good academic standing and the lack of objection from fsu they granted him a waiver from the usual transfer rules and were very pleased that julian will be part of our program and have the opportunity to lend support to his family
3061609 it could be possible that in the next year he could lose two members of his immediate family
3061610 sexier than all the girls in all the magazines and thats true
3061611 it is a diversification and will help boost the companys profitibality
3061612 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3061613 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
3061614 i cant say i understand the rules of the media and im not sure they do either

3061616 health is a basic human need it is fundamental to the successful functioning of individuals and of societies health promotion aims to empower people to control their own health by gaining control over the underlying factors that influence their health
3061617 we strive for a democracy in which all citizens have the right to express their views and are able to directly participate in the environmental economic social and political decisions affecting their lives
3061618 we need more than rhetoric we need action i am therefore recommending a greater emphasis on prevention and wellness as part of an overall strategy to improve the delivery of primary care in canada the allocation of new moneys for research into the determinants of health and that governments take the next steps for making canadians the worlds healthiest people

3061629 the foreign ministry has to state that the us department of state is ill informed georgia has not stopped attacks against civilian and russian peacekeepers in south ossetia

3061643 sometimes if the walkers are doing a circular route then she will arrive back with them
3061644 i dont know when she is going to go next

3061661 when we decided to do the feature we went back to the actors and said look were doing a feature would you like to do the voice could you come in a month some of them were all over the world it was hard to get all the actors that would be off on set
3061662 you need people available every week also you cant really afford multi million dollar actors to do a television series those guys make more during their coffee break
3061663 it used to be in animation you just had unknown actors do the parts the idea of hiring a really good actor tom hanks for instance was a really revolutionary idea
3061664 partly they did it because they were great actors partly they did it cause they wanted to use them for publicity to be very honest with you i dont really think i need to hire a big movie star to publicize my movie i dont need angelina jolie here thats what it comes down to in the end they have two days in the studio and then they have like two weeks doing press they are mainly paid for the press stuff

3061688 less than 15 minutes after she drove away from the offices of tpd she drove out of the sight of the officers who assured her they would be right on top of her watching and listening the whole time
3061689 she cried out for help as she was shot and killed and nobody was there to hear her
3061690 there is no doubt that andrea green and deneilo bradshaw are the ones that brutally murdered rachel hoffman but through poor planning and supervision and a series of mistakes through the transaction tpd handed ms hoffman to bradshaw and green to rob and kill her as they saw fit
3061691 although ms hoffman had a well established business of cannabis distribution with her friends she had no experience with dealing in ecstasy cocaine or firearms
3061692 although a lieutenant was monitoring the radio transmissions she was also tasked with a computer audit at the same time and was somewhat distracted
3061693 further the lieutenant had only been supervising the unit for less than three months and had no prior experience in the vice unit
3061694 this makes no sense she would have been a major dealer
3061695 they wouldnt have treated her the way they treated her this is a real incongruity

3061715 how much different will things be for iraq as a result of today

3061718 she loves going for a walk and appears fascinated by the trains especially if she can have a free ride
3061719 i miss her and start calling out her name when she doesnt come i know she has gone again
3061720 she has probably followed walkers to the train station and got on board the next thing i get a call from the station
3061721 sometimes if the walkers are doing a circular route then she will arrive back with them
3061722 i dont know when she is going to go next

3061728 this is a particularly impressive performance given the very difficult economic climate in all our main international markets
3061729 exporters throughout waterford and the country are having to use all their expertise and creativity to ensure that they can continue to do deals abroad not only are the global economic conditions putting pressure on international dealings but the strength of the euro against the dollar and sterling is adding another hurdle to trade waterford exporters have played their part in helping to deliver these national figures and they deserve great credit for their contribution
3061730 ive spoken to a few people involved in exporting over the last few months who have told me about the numerous difficulties they are encountering in the global marketplace at present however these results are a tribute to them and show why irish businesses have been so successful over the last decade
3061731 obviously there is some time to go yet before the global economy gets back on track but if our exporters continue their excellent work they will be well positioned to take advantage of any economic upturns that will benefit not only them but the irish economy as a whole
3061732 it was a lot cheaper in the north maybe half the price youd go up buy a box of cork amp kerry creameries butter bring it back to dublin and give it to people they would go up another time and bring you back butter
3061733 you would often see fellas running across the fields with televisions kettles toasters anything they could bring back into the south they went across the fields to avoid the customs but sometimes youd see the customs fellas running after them they never got your parents butter though

3061752 al valencia lo dejamos atr s en el grupo en barcelona disputamos nuestro mejor partido pese a que quedamos eliminados muchos no nos hubieran cre do capaces de alcanzar los cuartos de final y eso que con un poco de suerte incluso podr amos haber llegado a semifinales nuestros rivales incluido el atl tico nos respetan ahora m s

3061761 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia concerns about what occurs there might seem distant and unrelated to the many other interests america has around the world and yet russian aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states of america
3061762 what the people of georgia have accomplished in terms of democratic governance a western orientation and domestic reform is nothing short of remarkable that makes russias recent actions against the georgians all the more alarming in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3061763 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
3061764 russia has escalated the crisis in georgia through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

3061773 obviamente estoy contento por el gol pero no satisfecho pues lamentablemente no nos pudimos quedar con el triunfo luego de que nos marcaron un penalti que al parecer no era todos estamos muy enojados con ese error que tuvo el rbitro pero ya est hecho no podemos hacer nada as es el futbol y ahora hay que seguir adelante para hacer un buen trabajo en nuestros pr ximos compromisos
3061774 en el primer tiempo nos cost mucho trabajo encontrar algunos espacios para hacer da o pero por fortuna en la segunda parte pudimos abrir el marcador que lamentablemente no pudimos mantener por algunos errores que tuvo el rbitro y que provocaron que no obtengamos nuestro segundo triunfo en casa

3061858 portrays a young korean girl in the u s as she struggles with life in a foreign country and her feelings for a korean american friend
3061859 there is a tiny cell component that is unique to germ cells the precursors to egg and sperm called nuage which means cloud in french other researchers recently suspected that nuage was involved in keeping genes from jumping around in germ cells of the female fruit fly
3061860 but until this mouse study no one knew for sure if it was involved in mammalian germ cells to test if the mouse nuage played a similar role in mammals we focused on a mouse protein called maelstrom whose distant relative protein in the fruit fly was implicated in the other study
3061861 we found that without the gene the process of meiosis was severely impaired
3061862 there was a profound defect in interactions of parental chromosomes a process known as synapsis leading to death of germ cells this was clear evidence that the protein is vital to the formation of sperm
3061863 we observed massive flooding of the cytoplasm and nuclei of germ cells by transposons in the mutant mice
3061864 this was the first time such a phenomenon was observed in germ cells of any species
3061865 since the jumping genes are not silenced just once during the development of the fetus but every time new sperm are produced during a mouse life its possible that germ cells may employ transposons in some fundamental way in male germline meiosis this research is the first such clue of that possibility we will be very busy over the next few years trying to crack this and other puzzles of maelstroms role in controlling meiosis and sperm production
3061866 identifying the specific normal cells that cancers come from can provide critical insight into how cancers develop
3061867 this may help us develop more rational and effective approaches to treatment
3061868 simply mutating a gene is not enough to cause cancer
3061869 the mutation has to happen in the right cell type at the right time in the case of patched gnps provide the critical context for tumor formation
3061870 we now have a central mechanism we can use as a tool to look for triggers in the genome that work with hox and sens to regulate the formation of neurons and blood cells
3061871 this allows us to identify other key genes downstream of hox and sens determine their role in development based on what happens with cell fate decisions and look for the causes of birth defects and disease
3061872 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3061873 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3061874 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3061875 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3061876 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3061877 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3061878 some of these same gene regulatory networks are re activated in the adult to direct the growth of new blood vessels
3061879 this can be beneficial as in the case of a heart attack
3061880 finding that a single factor regulates a large part of the angiogenic process creates a significant target for therapeutic development for any disease involving the vascular system
3061881 the next step is to find ways to modify this microrna in the setting of disease and test its ability to alter the disease process
3061882 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
3061883 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
3061884 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
3061885 there must be susceptibility factors in the granule neuron precursor cell that predispose it to forming cancer so we now must try to understand what it is about this cell type that makes it susceptible to forming cancer in response to sonic hedgehog signaling this relationship between stem cells and oncogenes suggests a new point of potential therapeutic intervention
3061886 when you get back to school there is a month of silence where everyone is getting back to normal then there is a rush of phone calls
3061887 as we get started on this wouldnt it be great if the three of us could talk about how to hit the ground running this year
3061888 they want to get back to what they were told in grad school parents are your friends they bring you the apple i tell the teachers im not fighting to criticize your work but to bring the resources you need into the classroom
3061889 you idiot i always wanted to participate are you totally retarded or something i would liked to have participated in the decision to have the baby in the first place but that little piece of work will be between you and god youll probably rot in hell after all this but of course i still want to participate
3061890 if youve got any students that need to see how to do a delivery nows the time
3061891 no no get back in there im not ready for this yet

3061970 these poll results demonstrate that parents are as apprehensive about their childrens media diets as they are about traditional social issues such as alcohol drugs violence and sex
3061971 when it comes to video games parents should know that what they play is a resource that helps demystify one of the most popular and challenging forms of entertainment their kids are into
3061972 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
3061973 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk

3061993 tsvangirais intimate relationships with his western overlords explains why he cant find it in himself to join africas call for the lifting of the sanctions that are wrecking havoc even among mdc supporters
3061994 he cannot find it within himself to urge britain to honour its obligation to fund land reforms in zimbabwe if tsvangirai had the interests of zimbabwe at heart he would have realised that the west is using him
3061995 the allegations that mdc supporters are being brutalised and murdered by zanu pf supporters are just that allegations attempts to justify claims of government repression
3061996 if zimbabwe is a land of milk and honey as zvayi wrote in his shocking articles why has he sought an economic and political sanctuary in botswana
3061997 the eu is fighting zimbabweans i am one of them if the idea was to instil fear in me they should know that instead i am inspired to defend my country from imperialism through the pen
3061998 i will never support the mdc as currently constituted because to me it is a counter revolutionary trojan horse that is working with outsiders to subvert the logical conclusion of the zimbabwe revolution

3062008 i cannot imagine how hard it is to be so far from home and away from so many loved ones in such challenging conditions and at this time when there is so much debate and people are questioning what we are doing and whether it is the right thing to do at this moment in world history our troops have an obligation to make sacrifices stand strong and defend our country at a moments notice this is the least thing that i could do to remind them that i think about them all the time and enough to come and visit them in person and bring them a little piece of back home rocknroll
3062009 no but im glad you are coming today because i spent all day yesterday in the hospital with contractions so she will be here any minute

3062036 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3062037 i think we look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3062038 im pretty sure everybody this offseason game planed a little bit for us or at least watched the giants defense to see how we attacked people
3062039 obviously they are going to be a little more sound on their game as far as what they need to do in order to protect their quarterback with detroit they played a quick game getting rid of the ball quicker its something well have to adjust to throughout the preseason are we concerned about that no because we had about ten plays that we were calling throughout the game its very vanilla for us
3062040 we addressed that immediately when the players got back after their day off
3062041 it opened our eyes as coaches so im kind of glad that happened im more than willing to find out things from a coaching perspective and the preseason i hope we find something out in this next one i would like for people to try and exploit things i think that helps us
3062042 in the game the other night there were various different reasons
3062043 some of them we were blitzing away from where he went some of them we were blitzing to where he went and some of them we were just in a base package there is a guy responsible for that and i can recall three times when we failed at that but i trust the guys will get that corrected

3062070 president bashar al asad should immediately order an independent investigation into the polices use of lethal force at sednaya prison

3062082 clearly theres a need and strong demand for further retail provision within the hyde park centre
3062083 the proposed 11 186sq m expansion of castletown shoppingworld would not significantly impact upon the role function and performance of the existing and future network of competitive facilities with the growth in retail expenditure ameliorating the impacts
3062084 the proposal seeks to preserve the retail hierarchy by expanding upon castletown shoppingworld consolidating the centre to meet the strong population growth and to improve the range and depth of retailing available with the centre
3062085 from my point of view the land was put on the market through a public tender
3062086 i submitted a tender like probably a lot of others
3062087 i have bought the land you cant blame me for buying a parcel of land put through a public tender
3062088 we have then gone back and given the opportunity for the federal government to buy back the land but if the federal government is not interested what are we supposed to do

3062108 the cpp is a national party that will choose a running mate informed by the dictates of ethnicity tribe or religion no not at all the main criteria is somebody who can be president in his or her own right we have always been a national party we have broadly and widely appealed to ghanaians all over so we do not have religious or ethnic considerations in any of this
3062109 once the cpp comes up with a decision that person will be well liked that person will be somebody that we ourselves will feel comfortable with therefore that person will be very very competitive as far as the other people in the race are concerned
3062110 those are the things i am going to concentrate on
3062111 we only had a consideration for the pnc for an alliance the pnc after agreeing and indeed after dr mahama agreeing to be my running mate went back and decided that they want to reconsider it
3062112 if the very concept of foreign election observers is noble why is that some of the most established and prominent democracies in the world do not encourage them for their own elections
3062113 what should be the place of foreign election observers in elections in africa how much power should be allowed to ascribe unto themselves in determining what is in the best interest of a society that is not theirs
3062114 four basic problems confronted the electoral process and still present great challenge to democratic governance in nigeria pervasive influence of money looming danger of electoral violence gender inequity and mindset on elections
3062115 take the issue of money in politics for instance in the 2007 elections in nigeria money was so excessively deployed that what ordinarily should be a national election no matter how strategically important nigeria is was internationalized with foreign institutions agencies and individuals hired at very exorbitant prices simply to aid the ascendance of the candidates and interest that hired them
3062116 against the backdrop of the passion the social and political cleavages that still characterize the african society as well the resilient traditional inclination that makes a big man most unlikely to easily accept equality with the small man machine and technology may hold the future for successful and less rancorous election conduct
3062117 with the new regime of voter registration nigerians who reach the age of voting now simply go into the nearest office of the commission and register for the next election
3062118 according to their own conscience and best judgment of the relative merits of the candidates not merely on the basis of ethnic affiliation or monetary and other inducements
3062119 the people must be free to form or join political parties participate in any legitimate political activity be a candidate campaign anywhere in the country register as a voter decide whom to vote for and cast secret ballot

3062146 hes a player the manager set his sights on very early
3062147 hes been looked at by a number of clubs but he wanted to come to us he was influenced by the presence of harry redknapp and the players here who can help him develop
3062148 hes a player that wants to progress lassana diarra came here from arsenal because he wanted to play regular football and he has flourished
3062149 kaboul wants to come here and do that as well
3062150 it wasnt a difficult choice to make coming here everyone in the papers was saying i was going to sunderland or aston villa but i only ever wanted to come here
3062151 as soon as i knew they were interested i said i want to come to pompey
3062152 i came here because the manager has wanted me for two years i met him two years ago when i was at auxerre and i like the man because he gives you confidence
3062153 its a good opportunity for me because the club has a lot of ambition
3062154 i think pompey are a top five premier league side and i believe i can achieve what i want to achieve at this club
3062155 weve got the uefa cup as well and i want to go a long way in that
3062156 it does mean that there is a lot of competition for places but thats good it keeps everyone focused
3062157 also i can play in midfield or at the back i dont mind really
3062158 ive always enjoyed challenges and as ive been out for so long im really excited
3062159 i dont have a great deal of time left in my career ill just enjoy what i have left as much as i possibly can
3062160 more than ever i have the enthusiasm and incentive to do well because ive been out for so long
3062161 last season it was difficult looking on from the sidelines in one sense but there was nothing i could do about it
3062162 it was a great season for the club and even if youre not playing it was still a great season for the club
3062163 retaining the champions league as it is now has never been done and what a challenge that is for us
3062164 as a club weve never won the european cup two years on the trot so we must step up to the plate if we want to achieve that
3062165 it felt good to get through 65 minutes i wanted to play 90 but the manager knew what happened to me during pre season in nigeria when i tired a little and picked up a knock
3062166 this is just the beginning for me i dont feel a great sense of achievement
3062167 i was missing a bit of sharpness on the ball and need to get up and down a bit more ive got a long way to go and im aware of that
3062168 this is the most inventive man utd team in terms of its style
3062169 the way players interchange has been different to the way utd teams have in the past even though there has been interchanging
3062170 the front three or four seem to be able to play in all positions its difficult for defenders who dont know who theyll be playing against from minute to minute never mind from match to match
3062171 at times we can be an intimidating team to play against because of the way we attack we have players who can beat opponents one on one
3062172 thats the most intimidating thing for defenders when opponents can run past you with or without the ball
3062173 at 1600 you should be able to run auto volts on everything except your ram if not then i would put your volts at

3062177 use of macs has risen 51 percent in the last year creating an even greater demand to protect mac users and their families from harmful and unwanted internet content
3062178 mac users can expect the same level of quality protection customer service and internet filtering that has become synonymous with net nanny which has made it the most trusted brand and top rated technology for client based internet filters on the market

3062180 as long as the law enforcement training academies need funding ill be looking for ways to support them in that effort
3062181 it would be a substantial increase in funding for us if that bill passes
3062182 that actually was our initiative up here sen mrvan and sen arnold initially authored that bill for us
3062183 they certainly can put in claims yes explosion is covered by homeowners insurance as well as tenants insurance i dont know if there are rental units in the area but homeowners and tenants both cover explosions
3062184 it is way too soon to know whether theres liability on the part of the propane company
3062185 whats going to happen know is that insurers will pay any claims that come along and it doesnt matter who was at fault the homeowners insurers the tenants insurers are going to pay now to fix damage and get people back into their homes
3062186 later on if insurers feel that the company was liable in some way they may subrogate they may sue the company to recover damages that they had to pay out
3062187 any homeowners policy will include coverage for fire and explosion
3062188 well certainly talk to your insurance representative to make sure youve got sufficient coverage
3062189 there are other natural events that are covered by most policies including wind or hail damage theft and break in are generally covered under homeowners policies but talk to your insurance representative to find out exactly the coverage youve got
3062190 and one thing you want to make sure of is you have sufficient insurance as well when you insure your home theres a value put to the home like the cost to rebuild it and you want to make sure that that value is accurate and sufficient and would cover the cost of it
3062191 the most important thing to say about that is that act of god is not an insurance phrase its a very common misconception with home car and business insurance act of god is not a consideration its not an exclusion its just not in there you know various so called acts of god or acts of nature that are covered by insurance as mentioned wind hail so these are natural events where there is coverage
3062192 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3062193 any proof of concept demonstrative code partially or fully functional or malicious mobile agent such as malware that is publicly available
3062194 the public availability of proof of concept code increases the likelihood that the vulnerability will face live exploitation either through targeted attempts or through a mass distribution method like in an exploit toolkit
3062195 common outlets for these public exploits are exploit testing tools like metasploit and canvas

3062202 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community and had planned to withhold a key detail of our results so that a malicious attacker could not use our research for fraudulent purposes
3062203 were disappointed that the court is preventing us from presenting our findings even with this safeguard
3062204 the courts order is an illegal prior restraint on legitimate academic research in violation of the first amendment
3062205 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion security and the public interest benefit immensely from the free flow of ideas and information on vulnerabilities more importantly squelching research and scientific discussion wont stop the attackers it will just stop the public from knowing that these systems are vulnerable and from pressuring the companies that develop and implement them to fix security holes

3062209 technology is dominated by two types of people those who understand what they do not manage and those who manage what they do not understand
3062210 for a list of all the ways technology has failed to improve the quality of life please press three
3062211 there is an evil tendency underlying all our technology the tendency to do what is reasonable even when it isnt any good
3062212 any increased emission from production of these products in china would likely be outweighed by the positive impacts of their use
3062213 the exporting industry may be more efficient than the national average due to greater foreign investment and newer technology
3062214 china has a very strict regulation for energy intensity for trade products so they actually discourage exports of energy intensive carbon intensive products no matter if this product is consumed in china or abroad
3062215 we still need tremendous efforts to achieve the 20 percent goal
3062216 out of considerations of energy security and climate change china has scraped rebates and raised tariffs on a series of energy intensive exports including steel and ferrous alloys to discourage the blind expansion of this sector
3062217 the test of the athlete revealed that she had tested positive for epo
3062218 we have asked the sports governing body the international cycling union to follow it up as any disciplinary measures will be complete after the games finish
3062219 im disgusted and annoyed that its a spanish girl who is the first positive doping test from the games
3062220 the spanish have been lax in their attitude to doping and this positive test is the result of that they need to deal with that issue
3062221 its an extremely regrettable experience if the positive is confirmed it is a stain on spanish sport
3062222 if confirmed it is bad for the athlete bad for the athletes health bad for spanish sport and for all of us
3062223 we will apply spamish anti doping legislation to the full
3062224 we will apply spanish law to her case and to whoever encouraged her to take the substance and who supplied the substance to her
3062225 we have more than doubled the budget for anti doping from three million euros to seven million euros we have broken up 10 clandestine laboratories and confiscated loads and loads of substances
3062226 i might have a chance but im not really thinking about it my legs are just so tired after today
3062227 i am a bit disappointed because im in the best shape for a long time
3062228 ive been building towards the games for a long time and ive showed with this bronze medal that im on great form
3062229 ive got a slightly more imposing build and a more solid engine than my rivals
3062230 i think i can do well in the time trial it will be hard but the course suits me
3062231 if newspapers go away you wont know whats happening in your community
3062232 the usual setup for the us pga is more like a tough us tour event but for the last couple years its gotten more like a traditional us open type test
3062233 its actually like they switched the two of them around this year and at the us open it is the guy who is holing the eight and ten footers who is going to be up there
3062234 no matter how good you are you are going to have a lot of putts over tiers and you will be running them five and ten feet by the hole the guy who is holing those back will have a great chance and he will hit more of his first putts close because of it
3062235 i know what i am have to do to get myself ready and whether i get it right or wrong is a different thing
3062236 i have worked on my swing long and hard and for the guts of two and a half years and over that period of time i have got myself in contention in majors over half the time and that is the main thing
3062237 i have changed from a player who thinks he has to get everything right to a player who knows that he doesnt have to do everything perfectly to win
3062238 i think this golf course is setup more like what a us open was set up three or four years ago before they had the first and second cut where missing the fairway by a couple of yards is the same as missing it by 10 yards
3062239 its a more intimidating test and more punishing in the sense that a slight miss is just as bad as a big miss

3062244 youre thinking of europe as germany and france i dont i think thats old europe you look at the vast numbers of other countries in europe theyre not with france and germany on this theyre with the united states
3062245 we have a really strong pipeline with dozens of opportunities across the uk
3062246 we are expanding in strategic sites creating individual restaurants that are raising the bar in terms of standards and quality
3062247 despite the fact that the uk is facing challenging times ahead people are still eating out particularly in more casual establishments and this should stand the pub industry in good stead for the coming year
3062248 i hope others will join me in shutting this movie out of our lives and our pocketbooks

3062255 the president says mom and the troops are doing such a good job and we need to stay here a little longer
3062256 the extension was ordered as part of the surge in troop strength to try to quell violence that had been convulsing iraq for months the brigade was extended another 125 days

3062274 his selfless actions prevented the enemy from turning the tide of the battle and undoubtedly saved the lives of his soldiers
3062275 the medal now hangs on the wall and the hero has gone on with life

3062279 gallant and another soldier wrapped tourniquets on kriesels legs they propped him up on stacked boxes of mres so blood would flow to his organs
3062280 the soldiers needed to move kriesel so they could tip the humvee wreckage and remove another soldier trapped beneath it
3062281 ostrom had to start coordinating the military aspects of two funerals it was the most unwelcome part of a job he never wanted
3062282 that bitter december was winding down when sgt j r salzman just back from home leave heard about kriesel
3062283 salzman wondered if this was the end then pushed that thought away

3062291 the dubai mercantile exchange not only offers strong potential from an investment perspective but also constitutes a strategic partnership that will develop our footprint in the middle east
3062292 a successful and liquid futures exchange linked to energy products in the region will help us to better manage some of the risks inherent in our own business and those of our clients we believe that the ongoing economic growth and development in dubai and wider gcc region will continue to drive the success of the dme delivering return on investment as well as enhanced opportunities for our global client base
3062293 vitol has been involved with the dme since its inception and we are delighted to have the opportunity to make a further commitment to the exchange by means of this equity purchase we have always held the view that the region needs a new price discovery mechanism for middle east crude oil destined for the eastern markets we believe that a regionally based futures exchange is the optimum way for the market to determine the value of middle east sour crude in a transparent and reliable way we remain confident that dme oman prices can be used by other producers as well as oman and dubai to price their crude and also that the dme contracts will become a very useful and powerful hedging tool for traders and refiners we congratulate the dme and its founder shareholders on their progress to date and looking forward to supporting and sharing in their further success in the future

3062312 wanita itu dinikahi kerana empat perkara kerana hartanya kerana tarafnya keturunannya dan pangkatnya kerana kecantikannya dan kerana agamanya maka hendaklah kamu mengambil wanita yang beragama supaya kamu berbahagia
3062313 dan di antara tanda tanda kekuasaan nya ialah dia menciptakan untukmu isteri isteri dari jenismu sendiri supaya kamu cenderung dan merasa tenteram kepadanya dan dijadikannya di antaramu rasa kasih dan sayang
3062314 semuga allah memberi rahmat kurnia kepada lelaki yang bangun di tengah malam lalu dia sembahyang dan membangunkan isterinya maka sekiranya enggan juga bangun untuk bersembahyang dia merenjiskan air ke mukanya semuga allah memberi rahmat kurnia kepada wanita yang bangun di tengah malam lalu bersembahyang dan membangunkan suaminya maka jika dia enggan dia merenjiskan air ke mukanya
3062315 kaum lelaki itu adalah pemimpin bagi kaum wanita oleh kerana allah telah melebihkan sebahagian mereka lelaki atas sebahagian yang lain wanita dan kerana mereka lelaki telah menafkahkan sebahagian dari harta mereka

3062319 and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god
3062320 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god
3062321 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
3062322 and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent
3062323 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust

3062330 the beauty of the net framework has always been that it makes it easier for developers to build applications that are visually stunning well connected and highly secure
3062331 however we want to make sure we are keeping the end user experience in mind as well which is why we created the net framework client profile the net framework client profile significantly speeds up the installation of windows and enables a much more consumer friendly experience this is a huge step forward for the more than 4 million net developers worldwide
3062332 i look forward to meeting with the class of 2012
3062333 students are the heart of any university and encouraging members of the freshman class in their decision to pursue a higher education is one of the more important duties of any college president
3062334 its very important for the freshmen to see themselves as one class so this will give them that opportunity
3062335 it also introduces them to key people and programs that are vital to their success at the university
3062336 theyll hear about topics such as residence hall life transportation getting involved discipline leadership tradition
3062337 the fair will offer students an activity while theyre waiting for the presentations to start

3062343 we had put this much time into getting this house that we decided we could wait longer
3062344 to our surprise the decision by the second mortgage holder to waive their stake took less than two weeks
3062345 my position is that it will require three to four years to reach this value which suits me fine
3062346 if you are not patient and you are desperate for a home this certainly isnt the way to do it
3062347 you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one
3062348 visual studio 2008 sp1 and the net framework 3 5 sp1 had an extremely positive impact on our ability to develop a web based application that our customer misys healthcare systems could use to manage patients records in fact it helped us boost development speed by 60 percent
3062349 the microsoft asp net ajax improvements and new capabilities such as ado net entity framework and ado net data services meant we didnt have to worry about any of the underlying plumbing and could simply focus on building a highly responsive and interactive experience for users
3062350 the beauty of the net framework has always been that it makes it easier for developers to build applications that are visually stunning well connected and highly secure
3062351 however we want to make sure we are keeping the end user experience in mind as well which is why we created the net framework client profile the net framework client profile significantly speeds up the installation of windows and enables a much more consumer friendly experience this is a huge step forward for the more than 4 million net developers worldwide
3062352 using the entity framework has significantly sped up our development cycle by removing a lot of the custom code we have to write
3062353 the entity framework took away the tedium of having to write standard data access code and business objects which gave our team a big productivity boost

3062357 a non blocking socket operation could not be completed immediately
3062358 one of the most demanding applications for providing convenient signal connecting points is the floor mounted connector box
3062359 the floor pocket box and the mini floor box solve installation problems by providing a generous array of connector options in an extremely robust package capable of withstanding rigorous use we believe these products will have a positive impact on installations requiring floor mounted connectors

3062367 spanje was heel effici nt in de cirkel en supergevaarlijk op de tegenaanval wij hebben ook kansen gecre erd maar konden er niet het maximum uit halen en tegen een topteam als spanje moet je die kansen afwerken de eerste 20 minuten waren minder goed maar de tijd van de zware nederlagen ligt nu echt wel achter ons de spelers hebben al meerdere keren bewezen dat ze een zware topwedstrijd kunnen spelen
3062368 we hadden verwacht dat spanje sterk uit de startblokken zou schieten en we hebben het moeten ondergaan maar we hebben het toch min of meer kunnen rechttrekken wij zijn een van de opkomende teams maar we hebben toch wel nog wat werk om de volle 70 minuten weerstand te bieden tegen een team als spanje
3062369 de ambities zijn door deze nederlaag niet veranderd we willen nog steeds een top 8 hier in peking en we willen onze wereldranking verbeteren natuurlijk is het een bonus als je een punt haalt tegen een topper maar het is na ef om te denken dat dat ook zomaar gaat
3062370 spanje is een van de beste teams van de wereld

3062375 het gaat meestal om kleine ritten van enkele euros de chauffeur wil liever niet discussi ren als de passagier weigert te betalen hij weet dat als hij de discussie aangaat hij het risico loopt geslagen te worden en er is uiteraard geen sprake van dat chauffeurs hun eigen wetten maken

3062410 i thought i could return to a life of celibacy after this
3062411 i agree that it isnt good to become a nymphomaniac but even so
3062412 ive heard of book clubs and sports clubs but a pleasure club is one step too far
3062413 i dont know i get drunk and just sleep with whoever
3062414 ill wake up and not even know whos in bed beside me
3062415 wow i wish i had a sex life like that er i mean thats not good you should give it up
3062416 you know youre not the only one whos had pleasure
3062417 i saw yumi having hyper self pleasure so i thought id join in
3062418 unfortunately i was inexperienced i didnt know where to put my hands
3062419 if you dont know what youre doing youre bound to hurt yourself
3062420 so to help you give up lets see if we can sleep in the same bed all night without having pleasure
3062421 megumi wont give me pleasure youll have to do it
3062422 maybe we should just have a little foreplay you know
3062423 did someone mention pleasure my rooms always open you know
3062424 you know ive seen someone whos at your level of pleasuring ability
3062425 look kids when it comes to pleasure you need to be responsible
3062426 hey we wanted pleasure last night not just a quick tease
3062427 we even tried having internet sex but it was no good
3062428 my friends are jealous of my sex life so theyve been curtailing my activities
3062429 youre a supporting character the last thing they want to hear is that youre getting more than them
3062430 if you ask me theres no harm in indulging in a bit of pleasure now and then
3062431 in fact ive wanted to seduce you for quite some time now
3062432 weve been able to clear 16 men using dna technology our list of prime suspects is starting to diminish
3062433 we feel that now is an appropriate time to re energize this case with help from the public in hopes that we can find a name out there that we have yet to investigate
3062434 dat gebeurt helaas wel vaker het probleem is dat het rioolstelsel bij een grote flinke bui het niet meer aankan we moeten dit wel doen om te zorgen dat we droge voeten houden
3062435 met een dag of twee vind je er niets meer van terug
3062436 we now enter the last part of the 2008 championship and visit a circuit which is very technical and which has many similarities to mugello so this is a circuit in which the talents of our rider can make a difference our goal remains the taking of a podium position in any race which would help us consolidate our position in the overall classification especially as fourth in the championship is just 11 pointed in front of us it will be important from here on in to finish races and get as many points as possible as everyone is so close together on points in 250s we know that our rider has to now try and recover some more points and therefore positions in the final standings that is our aim
3062437 brno is a circuit appreciated by riders because it has so much variety and is technically very good from the start after a short straight theres a descent followed by a rise meaning theres a lot of elevation changes andrea has taken two second places in the last two years and considering his recent form he could make another good race here yuki enjoys the brno circuit after testing here and being competitive in the races but for various reasons he has not obtained the results he deserved lets hope these results could be achieved here this year
3062438 this year on the brno circuit we will have another unknown factor as the tarmac on the circuit has been re laid so we will have to see how it affects the degradation of our tyres it is a technical circuit with a wide variety of curves and turns the circuit is challenging to go fast on but is enjoyable over the past two years with the 250cc machine ive got two second places but with the motogp bike it is difficult to make a prediction i enjoy the track but it is not one of my favourites
3062439 at the brno circuit we have done well in testing but weve not got the race results weve wanted this year i want a good race to earn points to put my back up in the championship standings i enjoy the track as its a technical one with many turns which go both uphill and downhill overtaking isnt a problem as its a wide circuit we may find that the new track surface may affect the level of grip but we are determined to put in a good performance
3062440 we all hope that what we do today will make a great impact for tomorrow
3062441 we all could be doing other things but none are better than this
3062442 im feeling pretty good now and im anxious to get back on track ive now got full movement back in the injured knee and its been fine during my training regime up to now i dont think its going to cause me any problems on the bike but its been almost seven weeks since ive thrown a leg over the ninja zx rr so i wont know for sure until we start free practice on friday brno is a track i like a lot and i believe its the motogp track ive ridden most frequently in my career which means i know the place like the back of my hand also our bridgestone tyres work well at this track and this combined with the new parts that kawasaki are bringing to the czech grand prix means weve got some positive things to work with even though the rehab at home with family and friends has been enjoyable i am really looking forward to seeing the team getting back on the bike and finding again the total mental focus necessary for the best possible result this weekend
3062443 the holiday period gave me a good chance to relax and recover so i hope i will be fine for brno when i returned from laguna seca my doctor told me i needed a week and a half of complete rest i couldnt train so i spent an enjoyable few days in mallorca disconnecting from everything and resting both my hand and foot i had the stitches removed from my hand in barcelona and then i started rehabilitation the hand still hurts but the wrist has good mobility and the fingers are no longer swollen the foot is still taped just to avoid rough movements i started training last week mostly on my bicycle i hope i can have a good race at brno to start the second part of the championship in the best possible way brno is a good circuit with some interesting uphill and downhill sections very much in the style of the classic circuits the track is medium speed to very high speed with some good corners and fast straights its the kind of circuit that demands a gentle fine riding style you dont need to be aggressive when taking the corners it has just been resurfaced so we will have to wait and see what the grip is like the atmosphere is always great with a big and enthusiastic crowd on race day getting the set up right for this track is always a delicate operation aiming to get the best compromise between cornering ability and braking stability

3062462 despite the fact that billions of phones are able to run applications industry research shows that less than 5 percent of mobile subscribers around the world are actually running third party applications on their phones cascada mobile believes there are two main reasons why this number is so low first that conditions for mobile application development are a huge challenge limiting the number of mobile developers and applications and second that there are few resources for finding applications that are of interest to subscribers the breeze platform and breeze apps portal solve both halves of this mobile application problem

3062467 saakashvilis attempt to picture this conflict as a russian american one has met with no support
3062468 of course georgia has a geopolitical significance for america as for any state seeking a top world role but the value of this regime lies in its anti russian thrust saakashvili has failed to gain the support he hoped for and will fail to gain it in the future including from nato countries they do not understand why they should quarrel with russia on an issue that can be seen from different perspectives saakashvilis unruly willfulness is beginning to worry them
3062469 at a time when russian planes are bombing the eastern suburbs of tbilisi in the area of a su 25 aircraft plant and the american leadership is taking its time in rendering military aid to georgia saakashvili is beginning to feel uncomfortable
3062470 if georgia has to be traded for iran the united states will agree to that step because irans nuclear ambitions worry the white house more than tbilisis political ambitions thats geopolitics and nothing personal
3062471 the involvement of nato troops in the war is absolutely ruled out
3062472 european armies have a fear for losses and for them a war against russia is impossible the same applies to the u s which besides is bogged down in iraq and afghanistan only turkey which unlike its nato allies is not afraid of losses could in theory come to georgias assistance but it is not a fact that georgia wants that there is a likelihood that such aid might grow into a form of occupation for the whole of georgia secondly turkey could ask too much for an operation that with a high degree of probability will lead to a direct face off with russia it might ask for extensive economic and military aid from the u s and eu membership guarantees from europe there are suspicions that neither washington nor brussels will find georgias future as critical for themselves as to pay such a price
3062473 the war is certain to end in the next few days with the conflict returning to purely political lines but now we should realize that on our southern borders we will have not an unfriendly country but a direct enemy more difficult to negotiate with
3062474 the current situation cannot even be compared with the situation that evolved around yukos bankruptcy it is much more serious
3062475 in 2004 negative events were developing around one company and now several negative factors have combined simultaneously
3062476 the situation is growing graver with every passing day first a conflict around tnk bp then another one around mechel and now the aggravation of the situation in the caucasus
3062477 just recall the yukos story non residents returned to the russian market several months after mikhail khodorkovskys arrest this is likely to happen again this time
3062478 china will show a mounting interest in russia and will invest more in it because we will now be a regulator of the chinese financial market and will be able to exchange information
3062479 there are underlying factors that keep the russian stock exchange not only from growing but even maintaining its positions
3062480 the chinese will be waiting russian investors have no particular incentives to invest in the chinese economy either
3062481 by allah i am not able to say that i have ever gone out on any day to seek out hadeeth seeking thereby the countenance of allah

3062483 we sought out this knowledge for other than allah but it refused to be dedicated for other than allah

3062500 marcar dos goles en el vicente calder n ante una afici n como esta que siempre apoya al atl tico es uno de los sue os que ten a por cumplir
3062501 hizo un partido muy completo no me gusta personalizar pero en este caso vale la pena por la edad del chico por sus pocos partidos en primera y por su aplomo con la pelota no se complica es un buen medio escudo y si encima hace goles y es de la cantera todo bueno
3062502 estoy muy contento pero sobre todo porque sacamos los tres puntos queda un partido menos y tenemos tres puntos m s adem s podemos aprovecharnos de que racing y sevilla jugar n entre ellos entre semana
3062503 el partido ante el recreativo me dio mucha confianza el equipo estuvo seguro sobre todo en la parte de atr s tenemos que darlo todo en los encuentros que nos quedan est claro que no se nos puede escapar la champions
3062504 la dedicatoria de los goles va para todos los que me han apoyado a lo largo de mi carrera para mi familia mis compa eros la afici n que me trata muy bien para el t cnico que me ha hecho dar el salto y me ha dado la confianza necesaria
3062505 es verdad que no suelo meter muchos goles pero alguno hago porque suelo subir en las jugadas a bal n parado faltas saques de esquina y algo cae

3062511 the official was not authorized to speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the diplomacy
3062512 to end stalker erotomania you have to crash their world around them
3062513 legal protective obligation smart missile or funny missile my brain my life my diplomacy
3062514 political order the queen placed back into command over sovereign georgia
3062515 if georgia falls this will also mean the fall of the west in the entire former soviet union and beyond
3062516 leaders in neighboring states whether in ukraine in other caucasian states or in central asia will have to consider whether the price of freedom and independence is indeed too high
3062517 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3062518 the goal of this operation is regime change in georgia
3062519 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry
3062520 it is clear that russias current leadership is bent on restoring a neocolonial form of control over the entire space once governed by moscow
3062521 when this failed the kremlin turned its attention to south ossetia ordering its proxies there to escalate attacks on georgian positions
3062522 my government answered with a unilateral cease fire the separatists began attacking civilians and russian tanks pierced the georgian border we had no choice but to protect our civilians and restore our constitutional order
3062523 yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia
3062524 and above all it is a war over the kind of europe our children will live in let us be frank this conflict is about the future of freedom in europe
3062525 no country of the former soviet union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than georgia
3062526 worked hard to peacefully bring abkhazia and south ossetia back into the georgian fold on terms that would fully protect the rights and interests of the residents of these territories
3062527 while we appealed to residents of abkhazia and south ossetia with our vision of a common future moscow increasingly took control of the separatist regimes
3062528 the kremlin even appointed russian security officers to arm and administer the self styled separatist governments
3062529 they know who i am and rank and as heard it is a lovely atten hut two three four and command over them
3062530 ibn umar radhiallaahu n said the prophet said do the opposite of what the pagans do keep the beards and cut the moustaches short
3062531 feel good or we like them we do them because it is the command of allah subhana wa taala in the quran allah subhana wa taala says
3062532 we were on a journey and one of us got injured later he had a wet dream he asked his companions can i perform tayammum they said no not if you have water he performed ghusl and died when they came to the messenger of allah they informed him of what had transpired he said they killed him allah will kill them do you not ask if you do not know the rescue of the ignorant person is the question he could have performed tayammum and dropped water on his wound or wrapped it with something and wipe over the wrapping and wash the rest of his body
3062533 and ask the people of knowledge if you do not know
3062534 one alim is more powerful against shaytan than one thousand devout worshippers
3062535 the superiority of the scholar over the devout worshipper is like the superiority of the full moon over the rest of the heavenly bodies
3062536 when a man has memorized 100 000 hadiths is he a scholar of sacred law a faqih
3062537 we will not take what you say and abandon what zayd said
3062538 when some authentic person brings us the fatwa of ali ra then we will not move from it a bit
3062539 allah will not snatch away knowledge abruptly from people but rather he will snatch knowledge by removing scholars
3062540 whoever gives a fatwa legal opinion without knowledge the sin will be on the one who gives the fatwa abu dawood so if you follow a scholar and they make a mistake the person getting the sin will be him not you
3062541 on the sixteenth of ramadhan we set out for battle in the company of allahs messenger sallahu alayhi wa sallam
3062542 o you who believe do not ask about matters which if they were made known to you would make things difficult for you if you do ask about them when the quran is being sent down they will be made known to you 5 101
3062543 allah dislikes you indulging in a lot of idle chatter a lot of questions and wasting property
3062544 allah has imposed obligations so do not neglect them he has established limits so do not exceed them and he has made certain things unlawful so do not commit them he has been silent about other things as a mercy to you not out of forgetfulness so do not ask about them
3062545 hold fast to the rope of allah all together and do not separate 3 103
3062546 as for those who divide up their din and form into sects you have nothing whatsoever to do with them 6 159
3062547 if you have a dispute about something refer it back to allah and the messenger
3062548 the judgment concerning anything you differ about is allahs affair 42 10
3062549 we must be candid about our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
3062550 questions may be posed at how fast that production can get to market based on existing and expanding infrastructure which may guide the pace of development in the near term
3062551 historically such large gains in consecutive years have rarely been followed by a third year of strong growth so from an annual perspective the idea that production growth would plateau had some precedent
3062552 however the steep gains achieved in marketed production even in the final months of 2007 should have shown that the growth trend had momentum to carry over into this year
3062553 i am still acting like a seventeen year old i definitely havent become middle aged ive got a house and a daughter and all that but i still like to have fun even in my business we still have fun
3062554 honey ive had a dream life and it was all luck im glad my mothers not around because i still dont plan ahead or think things out mother told me once if the gardener asked you to go to chinatown with him youd go and i thought well of course i would
3062555 i share the frustrations of families and businesses in san antonio concerning congress failure to address high gas prices
3062556 san antonio families deserve better prolonged high gas prices can have a negative impact on the citys bustling tourism industry and thousands of jobs which depend on a robust travel market i hope all texans will join me in demanding swift bipartisan action to lower prices at the pump

3062563 i hope the siggraph experience will help me better propel myself into the industry and hopefully help me be fully employed
3062564 i had a scholarship to vfs last year but couldnt make it up to canada this year siggraph is a great step forward for me
3062565 siggraph is honored to host this special advance screening at the festival
3062566 the star wars films have always been stellar examples of visionary visual effects seeing these effects paired with computer animation and the behind the scenes knowledge from dave filoni will be an incredible experience for fans and film professionals alike
3062567 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
3062568 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
3062569 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
3062570 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
3062571 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
3062572 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
3062573 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
3062574 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
3062575 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
3062576 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
3062577 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day
3062578 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
3062579 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
3062580 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
3062581 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
3062582 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
3062583 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
3062584 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
3062585 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
3062586 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
3062587 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
3062588 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
3062589 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
3062590 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
3062591 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
3062592 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
3062593 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
3062594 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
3062595 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential

3062609 wanneer men onderweg is dan schrijft men de liedjes meestal niet helemaal af maar tegelijkertijd ontstaan wel de beste idee n als je merkt dat er een idee opborrelt dan moet je je daar gelijk op richten

3062619 we vinden het hier geweldig omdat het hier altijd geweldig weer is en ja we houden ook van de zon ik heb de zon ook gewoon nodig om een goede dag te hebben bovendien hebben tom en ik een beetje van de stad barcelona kunnen ontdekken en ik moet zeggen het is echt een prachtige stad
3062620 nee als je het aan een bekende van ons zou vragen dan zouden zij zeggen dat we hetzelfde zijn gebleven mochten we veranderen dan hebben altijd nog onze vrienden en familie die daar een opmerking over kunnen maken
3062621 ich will dich haben nur dich die ganze nacht und im monlicht schmelzen wir von sehnsucht

3062652 i thought it was cool when i was younger i had short hair but i got tired of always having to style it i wanted a hair do that was easy to take care of and looked the way it was supposed to when i woke up in the morning thats why i let my hair grow and got dreadlocks
3062653 i dont want to change anything about myself i think that everybody should be the way that they want to be and noone needs to change anything about themselves
3062654 i cant live without bill we do everything together we tell eachother everything we are unseperable

3062662 haha gekkerd bill wilt mij niet en als hij me zou willen dan zou hij niet zo ver gaan hij zegt het zelf ook altijd hij is geen one night stand typje
3062663 van duitsland naar detroit en van magdeburg naar manhattan tokio hotel heeft het gedaan inmiddels is de band over de hele wereld succesvol en zijn de jongens meer in het buitenland dan in hun thuisland het afgelopen weekend gaf de teenieband die drie jaar geleden nog onbekend was hun enige concert in duitsland david motjehart heeft als een van de weinige met de jongens gesproken
3062664 de magdeburgse jungs hebben de aarde onder controle dat moet eenieder bekennen
3062665 drie jaar geleden waren bill tom georg en gustav nog nobodies en nu zijn ze global players
3062666 hoe is het om volwassen te worden voor de ogen van een miljoenenpubliek hebben ze nog wel een priv leven en natuurlijk het belangrijkste voor de vrouwelijke fans wie heeft een vriendin en wie is op het moment nog op zoek naar een liefje
3062667 ik zou het fijn vinden om weer verliefd te zijn maar we moeten maar even zien hoe dat zal lopen
3062668 tokio hotel zijn terug in duitsland er zijn vele vragen en wij hebben de antwoorden optisch gezien is dit weekend hetzelfde als alle anderen de westfalenhalle te dortmund is tot aan de nok gevuld met ruim 12 000 fans maar niet alleen daarom is het concert bijzonder het is namelijk het eerste concert dat dit jaar in duitsland is gegeven vanwege bills stemband op moesten alle tot nu toe geplande concerten worden afgezegd toen bill weer eenmaal op de been was ging de band gelijk door naar amerika voor een pr tour de amerikanen zijn er blij mee maar de duitse fans waren bang hun grote idolen te verliezen
3062669 na ja zoiets kan je eigenlijk niet vergelijken met een concert in dortmund we proberen alles zo goed mogelijk te plannen zodat we uiteindelijk toch weer in duitsland concerten kunnen spelen en zodat we ook weer eens terug kunnen komen
3062670 toch is en blijft de usa op dit moment een speerpunt het is een risky business want zo is het bekende artiesten als robbie williams niet gelukt door te breken aan de andere kant van de oceaan bij tokio hotel is dat niet het geval dat hebben we de afgelopen weken wel kunnen merken alle concerten zijn uitverkocht de jongens werden veelvuldig gevraagd om bij talkshows op te treden daar had echt niemand op gerekend
3062671 het is maar een beetje raar voor ons ik weet nog goed dat toen we onze fotos op times square zagen hangen dat d t voor een beangstigend gevoel zorgde we konden echt niet geloven dat wij dat waren drie jaar terug hebben we namelijk nog op van die piepkleine podia in magdeburg gespeeld en dat we nu zo succesvol zijn is echt je reinste waanzin echt ongelofelijk
3062672 je moet even terug denken aan vroeger drie jaar terug kende bijna niemand tokio hotel de aanstormende garage combi was bijna schattig te noemen dat gaat al wat minder op voor het interview met de boys op het schoolplein nog voordat bill de baard in de keel kreeg waarin ze het over leraren hebben
3062673 misschien zijn enkelen best aardig omdat ze handtekeningen voor hun kleinkinderen willen hebben of zo maar degenen die ons vroeger niet mochten zullen hetzelfde over ons blijven denken
3062674 de leraren die ons voorheen slecht behandelden zullen dat nog steeds blijven doen
3062675 sindsdien heeft tokio hotel 5 miljoen albums verkocht de omzet daarvan wordt geraamd op ongeveer 30 tot 40 miljoen euro hoe groot de vraag naar de band is is moeilijk te beantwoorden men zou het eventueel aan de fans die naar dortmund zijn gereisd kunnen vragen hier wordt namelijk duidelijk dat de band in alle leeftijdscategorie n fans heeft hier zien we bijvoorbeeld een moeder met haar dochter
3062676 wat is het ergste wat je met je dochter hebt moeten meemaken
3062677 hoe lang denken jullie nog te wachten voor jullie naar binnen kunnen
3062678 ik denk dat het snel zal gaan een uur nog misschien een halve
3062679 de band is zeer geliefd maar staat ook continu in de spotlights het meest recente voorbeeld deze fotos van een rokende bill met een long drink tijdens de aftershowparty een hele discussie ontstond afgevraagd werd in welke mate de jongens nog voorbeelden zijn
3062680 we zijn doorgebroken op ons 15e nu zijn we 18 en intussentijd heeft iedereen kunnen zien hoe wij volwassen werden welke fouten wij maakten we hebben besloten er niet zo geheim over te doen omdat ons leven nou eenmaal voor het publiek plaatsvind wij hebben zelf voor dit leven gekozen en we willen ermee verder gaan op een gegeven moment heeft het ook gewoon geen zin meer om alles te verbergen en je te schamen voor datgene wat eigenlijk fout is
3062681 misschien heeft hij gelijk wellicht hoort dit inderdaad bij het succesleven dat de jongens leiden ze zijn hoe banaal dat ook mag klinken authentiek en wereldwijd bekend de band laat overal sporen achter relaties met mensen zijn daarom moeilijk op te bouwen en plotseling verteld bill zeer persoonlijke dingen
3062682 ik ben nou ja wij zijn zoals voorheen nog steeds single in mijn geval is het zo nu de tijd aan mijn neus voorbijtrekt ik toch steeds meer op zoek ga je hebt gevoel iemand te missen iemand die aan je zijde is dat heb je gewoon als je zo lang onderweg bent nog steeds denk ik dat het super zou zijn weer verliefd te worden eerst maar eens zien wat er gebeurd ik hoop alleen dat het niet al te lang zal duren
3062683 hoewel bill op de grote liefde wacht heeft tweelingbroer tom toch wat meer pleziertjes de voordelen die het rocksterleven met zich meedraagt blijven bij tom in tegenstelling tot bill niet beperkt tot feestjes en aftershowparties
3062684 frankrijk is echt een geweldig land daar hebben we echt hele leuke concerten gegeven de beste feestjes vind je overigens in rusland daar zijn de grootste en coolste clubs en daar hebben we ook echt goed gefeest
3062685 ja afgezien van dat heb ik eigenlijk overal ter wereld seks
3062686 na het concert in dortmund gaat de band gelijk door naar nederland met daaropvolgend concerten in parijs en barcelona de jongs hebben het druk
3062687 als fu g nger sollten sie in unbekannten gegenden besonders umsichtig sein
3062688 vroeger zat ik weleens in mijn kamer dan keek ik naar mijn nena posters en vroeg ik me af hoe het zou zijn popster te zijn dat wij het zo ver hebben weten te schoppen is echt ongelofelijk

3062694 er zaten ook boze brieven van vertwijfelde ouders bij zij beklaagden zich bij de franse platenmaatschappij over het feit dat hun kinderen in plaats van engels liever duits op school willen leren
3062695 het is echt super om voor zon mensenmassa te staan
3062696 als zon heel stadion al je nummers meezingt krijg je gegarandeert kippenvel
3062697 het was een ware bevrijding om na zon lange tijd weer in de microfoon te zingen
3062698 hij was behoorlijk ongeduldig en gespannen voordat hij het podium op kon maar toen hij er eenmaal stond verloor hij al zijn zorgen
3062699 oh maar santa ik ben echt een zeer lieve jongen geweest dit jaar
3062700 o ja chim ne also warte hier mal mit deiner freundin dann komm ich bald z ruck okay
3062701 godver zag je dan niet hoe hij naar je keek en je hand bleef vasthouden
3062702 jezus kind je bent ook echt ongelofelijk zucht miranda en ze kijkt me aan met een zelfs voor haar doen merkwaardige blik
3062703 misschien gaat ie je wel zn nummer geven of zo
3062704 en dan bel ik hem vanavond en dan vraagt ie of ik na het concert naar zn hotel kom met de bedoeling vanavond te gaan reden tuurlijk
3062705 chim ne hij zegt echt niet zomaar tegen een of andere hysterische fan dat ze moet blijven staan wachten totdat hij terugkomt
3062706 misschien moet hij wel gewoon naar de wc en moeten wij de wacht houden
3062707 ja hoor naar de wc en daarna komt hij terug en wat dan mogen we weer gaan zeker
3062708 het is niet zomaar dat wij terwijl al de andere fans al lang weg zijn hier nog met zn twee n staan
3062709 h was macht ihr da denn ihr habt hier gar nichts zu suchen raus
3062710 tschuldigung aber tom kaulitz hat uns gefragt hier zu blei
3062711 er hat es meine freundin gesagt wir bleiben hier egal was du tust
3062712 je gaat toch niet weg als tom wilt dat je blijft
3062713 doe normaal tom komt toch niet en nu worden we de hal uitgezet omdat jij een grote bek tegen die gast geeft
3062714 sie haben auf mich gewartet darf ich die zwei mitnehmen
3062715 sorry f r was ihr mit diesem komischen typ durchhalten mu ten aber ich mu te eben mit unserem team berlegen ob ich euch hier reinlassen darf
3062716 ze zijn hier om te blijven en ze verdienen het het zijn echte muzikanten
3062717 vooral zij haar is erg gaaf met die witte puntjes is het nog leuker
3062718 hij is lekker rustig lief en knap bill vind ik ook wel leuk hij doet zijn eigen ding maar gustav staat n t niet zo op de voorgrond en op zulke types val ik wel
3062719 het dutch street team op hyves had drie acties verzonnen voor dit concert je kon een vlaggetje meenmen om te laten zien uit welk land je komt bellenblaas voor tijdens 1000 meere of een handdoek die je dan in de lucht moet houden als de bandleden op het eind hun handdoeken weggooien
3062720 ik vond het erg leuk dat ze nu het hele concert in het duits zongen dat past gewoon beter bij ze het was ook heel gaaf dat ze geh speelden dat nummer had ik nog niet live gehoord toen bill vertelde dat hij lang niet heeft kunnen zingen en dat hij blij was hier te zijn straalde hij helemaal zo mooi
3062721 het was helemaal geweldig het is elke keer zo mooi om te zien dat bill bij tom gaat staan met een arm om hem heen of bij georg en dat hij dan naar hem lacht dan zie je dat ze gewoon een goede band met elkaar hebben ik vond het ook gaaf dat ze alles in het duits zongen dat komt beter over mijn duits op school gaat ook beter sinds ik fan ben ik vind het erg leuk als ik weer duits heb haha
3062722 we zullen altijd naar holland komen als jullie dat willen
3062723 wat zijn jullie met v l ongelooflijk echt fijn dat jullie allemaal zijn gekomen het is een beetje koud maar laat je daardoor niet afschrikken
3062724 mijn operatie heeft mijn manier van denken veranderd tot nu toe was het eigenlijk vanzelfsprekend om te zingen nu weet ik dat het een geschenk is om te kunnen zingen voor deze gave ben ik ontzettend dankbaar
3062725 als ik mijn bloed hier aan doneer wil ik daarmee laten zien dat ik achter mijn stad sta en in het bijzonder achter de scm man man wat heb ik geleden toen het begin dit jaar slecht met de club ging
3062726 mijn laatste bijgewoonde wedstrijd was toen ze de tegenspelers met een verschil van 14 punten uit de hal wisten te jagen maar tegen wie was dat ook alweer
3062727 vorig jaar heb ik van dj alex ninow backstagekaartjes voor een tokio hotel concert gekregen ik vond de show van de jungs echt ongelofelijk en backstage hebben we elkaar leren kennen met gustav had ik gelijk een goede band
3062728 ik weet het niet zeker ik zeg niet nee maar ook niet definitief ja
3062729 we hadden niet op zo veel fanreacties vanuit de usa gerekend en zijn er heel dankbaar voor vertelde frontman bill aan bild de
3062730 there are german athletes or models these days that are famous in america but hardly any musicians it would be something very special if tokio hotel it would make it
3062731 yesterday the album was on place 13 today we are on 24
3062732 after the first prognoses we will be climbing in the top 50 of billboard charts
3062733 to see this huge poster of us on times square was simply overwhelming
3062734 im sure that you can still earn money with the music business even in ten years
3062735 ik geloof dat het komt door de dreadlocks die ik heb men schijnt die kennelijk met drugs in verband te brengen
3062736 naar onze plaatsenmaatschappij in berlijn werden de afgelopen weken zeer veel brieven gestuurd door de duitse fans ze vroegen ons naar de
3062737 de wonden aan mijn stembanden zijn al helemaal geheeld en daarnaast rook ik vrij zelden ik let echt heel erg op mijn stem maar na de afgelopen weken vol stress wilde ik me gisteren gewoon even laten gaan
3062738 na een operatie zijn de stembanden nog heel gevoelig vooraal als er een polyp van is afgehaald zoals dus bij bill het geval is
3062739 ik ben zo blij dat ik eindelijk weer met iemand in het duits kan praten
3062740 ons engels is ontzettend slecht zo slecht dat je het niet eens zou geloven
3062741 wildplassers ontdeden en vervolgens de deuropening besloten te blokkeren zodat de in alle rust konden plassen
3062742 mit 21 prozent der stimmen den zweiten platz hinter den usa die politische stabilit t und die starke technologieszene in deutschland gaben hier den ausschlag
3062743 habt ihr auch der meet amp greet bei bravo gewonnen
3062744 die jungs kommen innerhalb von hm zwei minuten oder so
3062745 uhm eigentlich sind wir hier durch zufall wir haben gar nichts gewonnen
3062746 ein man drau en dachte das wir f r die meet amp greet kamen
3062747 sorry f r was ihr mit diesem komischen typ durchhalten mu ten aber ich mu te eben mit unserem team berlegen ob ich euch hier reinlassen darf
3062748 georg hat mir gefragt euch mit zu nehmen weil er sich total in euch verknallt hat
3062749 also geht ihr mit nach oben dann kann ich etwas ber unser spannendes tourleben erz hlen und k nnen sie sich die sch nen garderoben anschauen
3062750 das war ne witz er will nur eine rundgang geben
3062751 oh h rt sich bl d an grosse st dte sind besser
3062752 joah gustav ist drau en liegt unter dem hellblauen himmel und trinkt biert
3062753 uhm ich gehe zu einer freundin von mir glaub ich sie wohnt hier in der n he
3062754 also wenn du willst kann ich was regeln mit nem hotel und so
3062755 aber nur wenn du und deine freundin miranda zustimmen nat rlich
3062756 sorry leutz maar gustav over here moest de boel weer eens zo nodig verzieken
3062757 huh bill ik dacht we dat handjeschouderding niet meer deden
3062758 jetzt sind wir wieder hier bei dir oben aufm dach
3062759 we just came by to say hello we are tokio hotel
3062760 bill is an immature teen hes 18 and gives the impression hes 30 and theres one thing i dont understand is he a boy or a girl
3062761 van dichtbij zijn de boys nog interessanter in het bijzonder leadzinger bill
3062762 we vinden het echt geweldig hoe we hier door de fans worden ontvangen de feedback is zonder twijfel super
3062763 twee keer zo veel gitaren dus ook twee keer zo veel groupies
3062764 bill kaulitz of tokio hotel looks like he was electrocuted during his mtv trl appearance in may 2008
3062765 wir freuen uns mit focus online und dem nachrichtenmagazin focus zwei starke partner gewonnen zu haben diese partnerschaft erm glicht uns zuk nftig die darstellung von sehr detaillierten informationen ber rzte heilberufler und institutionen aus dem gesundheitswesen ein service der f r viele patienten von hohem wert sein wird
3062766 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do
3062767 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3062768 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3062769 they were able to develop such a loyal fan base
3062770 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humour they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3062771 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3062772 i think its important to show what kids really use
3062773 things can take a turn and you can get a big head or get jaded
3062774 the next two weeks were going to be unveiling more and more ads and everybody that we talk to is saying get ready get ready
3062775 rather than acting as a neutral peacekeeper russia has escalated the hostilities through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside the conflict zone
3062776 canada calls on russia to respect georgias borders and to desist from any further encroachment on georgias territorial integrity
3062777 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3062778 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3062779 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3062780 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3062781 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3062782 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3062783 there was no way we can spend our limit so we were asked by the party if we can help contribute
3062784 er is niets erger voor een zanger dan niet te kunnen zingen en duizenden fans teleur te stellen
3062785 bill had eigenlijk al wat langer laryngitis we hoopten dat het goed zou komen maar de ziekte bleef steeds terugkomen
3062786 een medisch onderzoek wees uit dat een operatie noodzakelijk was na de op heeft bill de tijd gekregen om te rusten zodat hij een goede comeback zou kunnen maken we hopen dat de fans dit begrijpen en dat zij zich realiseren dat bills gezondheid op dit moment het belangrijkste is
3062787 nadat we het voor elkaar hadden gekregen het concert te verzetten naar de volgende dag werd het ons duidelijk dat dit echt een big thing voor ons is het is een muziekfestival voor ons en de fans en geloof mij het zal overweldigend zijn
3062788 het is gewoon speciaal vooral als je je realiseert dat we nog maar een jaar geleden een trabendo sessie konden doen ik denk dat je wel een goed beeld hebt van hoe snel het in zon korte periode kan gaan
3062789 de mogelijkheid om op zon plek als deze te mogen performen is ongelofelijker dan een show te spelen voor de eiffeltoren zoals vorig jaar op 14 juni
3062790 dit is het beste geschenk dat een band kan krijgen van haar publiek het was echt ongelofelijk
3062791 ja inderdaad vooral als je doorhebt dat geen enkele concert hetzelfde zal zijn ik weet nog dat ik twee concerten op rij moest spelen in parijs en dat ik me destijds best wel zorgen maakte om mijn stem aan de ene kant moest ik mijn best doen omdat het publiek helemaal losging en aan de andere kant moest ik op mijn stem letten als je weet dat het niet goed gaat met je stem ben je toch wel iets banger wanneer je de b hne op moet en zelf tijdens de toegiften wist een verstikkend gevoel zich meester van mij te maken op dat soort momenten weet je nooit wat er kan gebeuren
3062792 soms worden we op locaties aangekondigd waar we nog niet eens over nagedacht hebben er is vaak sprake van miscommunicatie
3062793 het is gek dat er zo veel geruchten de ronde doen op het net
3062794 de roddels de foute informatie we kunnen niks anders doen lachen begin dit jaar scheen dat georg ons ging verlaten en nog eerder dan dat bereikte een roddel betreft gustav ons hij zou ook weggaan dat is gewoon onzin je ziet toch dat we nog steeds samen zijn en dat alles nog steeds goed
3062795 geloof niet alles dat over ons wordt geschreven en waar we zelf geen controle op hebben
3062796 we waren echt verbaasd te ontdekken dat de amerikaanse fans dezelfde energie hadden als de europese fans
3062797 om helemaal beter te worden kan bill het zich niet verloven de hele tour te hervatten hierdoor zou hij zijn stem weer kunnen verliezen
3062798 the jonas brothers die disney liedjes zingen terwijl ze eruit proberen te zien als guns nroses volgens de befaamde daily was het optreden in de roxy te omschrijven als muzikale pap
3062799 echt dat was het meest ondankbare publiek dat je je kunt voorstalen maar de jongens zijn als ware profis doorgegaan
3062800 het zou anders veel te saai voor me zijn geweest zo zonder programma
3062801 ik heb 100 exemplaren gekocht en mee naar huis gesleept
3062802 we zijn echt superblij dat alles zo goed is gegaan
3062803 nee nee geen feestjes vanavond als we op tour zijn moeten we vroeg slapen
3062804 ja natuurlijk kunnen we een handtekening voor je nichtje schrijven
3062805 nu heeft mijn ex vrouw bij onze zoon echt geen kans van slagen meer
3062806 ihre chance zum erwerb eines einzigartigen web 2 0 startups
3062807 kijk nou tom die heeft zo duidelijk m jn mascara gebruikt
3062808 also wenn du willst kann ich was regeln mit nem hotel und so
3062809 aber nur wenn du und deine freundin miranda zustimmen nat rlich
3062810 und was als ich dich jetzt k sse k sst du denn romantisch zur ck
3062811 geht ihr jetzt mit alle fans darfen jetzt rein und ihr wollt doch ja auch in die erste reihe stehen
3062812 ja dat zie ik ook wel maar hoe kom je daar aan had je die vanmiddag ook al
3062813 dus dus dus dus je hebt nu het pasje van toms hotelkamer in je handen
3062814 het is een heel lang verhaal maar het blijft stil aan de andere kant en tegelijkertijd kijkt miranda me aan alsof alles nu pas tot haar doordringt
3062815 nou z lfs miranda geloofde het niet maar ik heb het pasje van toms hotelkamer
3062816 haha nee ik kan me voorstellen dat ze dat niet geloofd
3062817 nou ja laat maar we zien je vanavond niet meer morgen wel ok
3062818 ik ga me eerst opfrissen weet je hoe erg ik naar zweet stink
3062819 dat heeft ook echt zin het wordt vanavond vast nog veel heter dan het in die concerthal was hoor
3062820 hij is geen goed idool maar hij is een ongelofelijk goede bassist
3062821 weet je toen ik zou oud was als jij ging ik naar een tokio hotel concert
3062822 die kleine italiaanse meiden hebben de belangrijkste duitse zinnetjes en woordjes goed voorbereid
3062823 de andere drie jongens hebben in elk land waar we tot nu toe zijn geweest nog niets gedaan in geen enkel land hadden ze een vriendinnetje ze hebben berhaupt niet iets met meisjes gedaan terwijl ik dat al wel over de hele wereld heb kunnen doen het is best lastig om een conclusie te trekken maar je kunt zeggen dat ik overal wel aan mijn trekken kom
3062824 de jongens hebben wereldwijd succes en niet alleen bij vrouwen dat bewijzen de fotos van parijs in maart los angeles in mei en die van gisteravond in rome de overwinningstocht van de magdeburger is ongelofelijk je zou daarom toch gaan denken dat er inmiddels flink wat geld op de bankrekening staat
3062825 op dit moment heb ik nog geen miljoen op mijn rekening staan de mensen die echt het grove geld verdienen zijn natuurlijk de platenmaatschappij als je veel geld wilt verdienen kun je beter voetbalspeler worden
3062826 miljonairs zijn ze kennelijk nog niet maar van het welbekende jetset leven krijgen ze inmiddels alles mee bijvoorbeeld inmiddels verliezen ze het overzicht en weten ze niet altijd even goed waar ze zich op het moment op de aarde bevinden
3062827 of vanavond een van deze dames tom heeft geholpen duidelijk te maken waar hij zich op dit moment bevind zal hij waarschijnlijk maar al te graag de volgende keer willen vertellen
3062828 echt es war sehr gut aber ich will dich auch ein bisschen verw hnen verstehst du
3062829 nou meisje zo krijgen die andere jongens tenminste hun vitamientjes binnen savvie
3062830 mein gott ey bist du nicht ein bisschen zu fr h aufgestanden tom
3062831 aber hm ich f hl mich einfach nicht so wohl hier jetzt
3062832 aber mach dich auf jeden fall keine sorgen ist nicht n tig
3062833 also ich hab mich kurz berlegt und mit miranda gesprochen aber
3062834 wir gehen heute shoppen hast du bock drauf mit zu gehen
3062835 neuh denk ich nicht ihr seid dabei deswegen wird es warscheinlich etwas l nger dauern vor die fans uns erkennen
3062836 na ja vielleicht auch nicht wenn tom dabei ist werden wir auf jeden fall erkennt
3062837 aber weiterhin werden wir nat rlich auch nach ne andere stadt fahren so k nnn wir warscheinlich mehr kreischis ausweichen
3062838 nein heute bleib ich hier bisschen ausruhen nichts tun fernsehen so etwas
3062839 zou het niet cool zijn als we nog een nacht konden blijven
3062840 ja dat is zeker vet maar zouden de jongens dat wel goed vinden
3062841 ja vast wel maar als het kan moet ik wel karin bellen
3062842 dan doe je dat maar we kunnen altijd nog naar karin toe en dit is echt a chance of a lifetime
3062843 willst du zusammen mit deiner freundin noch eine nacht hier bleiben bei uns bei mir
3062844 ja natuurlijk ik vertel jou toch ook wat ik meemaak
3062845 ich hatte schon berall wo wir aufgetreten sind sex meine band kumpels haben da nie was gerissen
3062846 da wir ja unter uns sind kann ich es verraten georg ist sogar nach wie vor noch jungfrau okay bill und gustav hatten zwar schon sex aber eben nicht viel fter als zwei oder dreimal
3062847 das scheinen die m dels zu merken die halten sich irgendwie automatisch an mich
3062848 ja natuurlijk ik vertel jou toch ook alles wat ik meemaak
3062849 zoveel heb ik thuis nog niet eens voor het pakken liggen
3062850 ehum we hebben nog ondergoed nodig ik heb niks meer bij
3062851 ja daar heb je een punt ik heb ook niks meer
3062852 also m dels nicht so was kaufen ja das ist verboten
3062853 ich hab miranda schon lange noch nie so gl cklig gesehen
3062854 ik heb wel eens mooie momenten gehad in mijn leven maar dit overtreft alles echt alles
3062855 bijna alle mooie herinneringen die we in ons leven hebben hebben we samen beleefd h
3062856 ik voel me nu echt de gelukkigste op aarde zoveel meisjes zouden nu in onze schoenen willen staan miljoenen meisjes
3062857 haha gekke meid ga nou maar eens in bad de jungs komen zo al terug
3062858 o wat heerlijk om te zeggen tom bill gustav en georg komen zo terug dus moeten we wel klaar zijn
3062859 geniet er nog maar effe van want morgen zijn we weer weg
3062860 georg gib deinen harenglatter doch mal ne pause und komm hier
3062861 na tom lass ihnen doch wir m ssen jetzt gehen
3062862 hallo ich bin david jost warscheinlich kennen sie beiden mich schon
3062863 haha dann schlafst du dieses wochenende nicht so viel oder
3062864 ja hallo ich hab nur das oberteil gesehen auch von miranda brigens
3062865 ja maar ik dacht dat ik de talky talky zou doen
3062866 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
3062867 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
3062868 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
3062869 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
3062870 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
3062871 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
3062872 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
3062873 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
3062874 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
3062875 the ship would be pushed by the spatial bubble and the bubble would be traveling faster than the speed of light
3062876 we are still a very long ways off before we could create something to harness that type of energy
3062877 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3062878 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3062879 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3062880 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3062881 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3062882 hopefully this study underlines the importance of how crucial older matriarchs are to the health of elephant populations
3062883 protecting the leaders of elephant herds will be even more important in what may be an increase in droughts due to climate change
3062884 recebemos informa es muito confi veis que os russos decidiram mover se em dire o a gori
3062885 por isso que decidimos tirar todas as nossas tropas e realoc las para defender tbilisi
3062886 ne soyez pas plus dala lama que le dala lama
3062887 nous pensions que cela serait malvenu et m me presque p nalisant
3062888 et lallemagne commerce trois fois plus avec la chine que la france
3062889 nous devons le recevoir huis clos dans le bureau dun s nateur cest une honte
3062890 le meilleur moyen pour faire progresser le droit nest certainement pas de boycotter ou de donner des le ons
3062891 le volontarisme certes n cessaire ne doit pas c der la place des gesticulations m diatico militantes
3062892 au del de son statut elle pourrait exprimer le souhait personnel de le rencontrer cest tout fait possible
3062893 before women in senegal could have children and keep playing in mali you stopped now women keep playing its changing a lot
3062894 five issues five sold out and the second printings too
3062895 ill have to tell mcguinness kids to stop buying so many copies seriously though i gotta thank warren simons and the entire thor crew who were so helpful at getting the god of thunder to guest star in this issue and rest assured thor vs red hulk the grudge match isnt far behind all of this builds to next issue when ol greenskin and the rulk finally have it out and i can promise you only one of them walks away
3062896 this comic is pretty much all i ever need from a hulk series and as long as each issue is this much fun ill be sticking around for a long time
3062897 the sponsorship of the olympic games is part of its passionate commitment to constantly give back to the nigerian community which has been very receptive and supportive of the bank phb brand
3062898 i would have to say that most ape versions of marvel characters are fairly similar to their human counterparts in broad strokes at least
3062899 that being said theres a core difference between them too
3062900 the ape heroes and villains are after all apes not humans and that makes the way they view things and react to things fundamentally different for all that the monkeyverse is similar to the mainstream marvel universe it is definitely not the same
3062901 the web swinger as spider monkey is sometimes called still cracks jokes and suffers a chronic case of angst but as i wrote the stories it became clear that this spidey is more egotistic than the human spidey
3062902 hes also a bit more naive a bit more accepting of the world around him that begins to change by the end of the story
3062903 ape cap is without a doubt the most commanding presence in the series
3062904 he leads the ape vengers and no one ever questions his orders but that sense of leadership and being in charge with just the smallest change in tone and attitude can become quite ominous and threatening
3062905 calm cool and clear thinking iron mandrills personality is probably closer to his human counterpart than many of the apes
3062906 but he has one of the very best names and credit where credit is due that name was suggested by editor steve wackers assistant thomas brennan
3062907 monkey wolverine is if you ask me a little more impetuous and even mischievous than the human wolverine
3062908 maybe like how the human wolverine might have been as a teenager he assesses situations very quickly makes decisions very quickly and never regrets his decisions no matter how things turn out
3062909 this decree seeks to protect enhance and in some cases restore the trust that our faith calls for between the church and the children and adolescents entrusted to their care
3062910 it is the intention of the archdiocese that no person who has been convicted of sexually abusing a child will work with children at an office parish school agency or institution of the archdiocese
3062911 the current business environment is very favourable for ongoing consolidation of the market in canada especially through the recruitment of independent dealer owners looking to join a strong banner with a very promising development plan
3062912 with 21 new independent dealers representing over 100 million in annual sales added to the rona network weve achieved a record first half in terms of recruitment
3062913 understanding what is normal and healthy sleep behavior is an important step
3062914 the support from the federal government for the 2015 pan american games bid demonstrates once again the commitment of the harper government towards high performance sport in canada
3062915 we look forward to working with our federal provincial and municipal government partners in crafting a winning bid
3062916 this announcement comes closely on the heels of the federal governments spring budget that contributed significant funding to the summer road to excellence program this ongoing support for high performance sport illustrates to all canadians the importance that the harper government places on sport and healthy lifestyles
3062917 this teams experience and record of investment success will position us as a leading investor in the clean tech space and will provide a valuable resource for our other business groups advising on the introduction of sustainable energy strategies
3062918 after an encouraging start to the year our second quarter was the strongest in our history
3062919 performance has been driven on a broad base of strong organic revenue growth low loan loss provisions and the widening of our networks margins we continue to be on target for growth in revenue earnings and market share for 2008

3062924 weve never heard of this before we dont know how it got there
3062925 we cant say whether or not the shark took a swimming young bear
3062926 we dont know how active these sharks are as predators
3062927 el liderazgo es m s que una cuesti n de esfuerzo y dinamismo de riesgo y de reto una cuesti n de proyecci n de percepciones y contrastes de audiencias y de mensajes la imagen es la forma m s segura para transmitir una idea
3062928 sends a clear signal that the cftc is on the beat and that our continued and increased cooperation with law enforcement authorities will help put these foreign exchange dealers where they belong in jail

3063038 what this benchmark study tells the industry is that there is a need for more sophisticated yield management on the part of premium publishers for stronger partnerships between publishers and ad networks for development of best practices and more focus on the value of interactive advertising
3063039 our industry is at an important juncture and now is the time for publishers to adopt strategic approaches to the use of ad networks who themselves have become critical players in the digital ecosystem

3063054 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3063055 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3063061 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3063181 in the second half we have continued to see strong revenue growth and we expect to achieve further improvement in 2009 however profits for 2008 will be affected by higher than expected recent investment and one off exceptional items
3063182 our high school accountability ratings are not where wed like them to be and that continues to be one of our priorities moving forward what is very encouraging is that secondary taks performance districtwide continues to improve and we are headed in the right direction
3063183 superintendents running school districts in plano frisco and mckinney may want to pay attention to whats happening on campuses in nearby richardson the texas education agency also reports that nearly half of richardsons students qualify as economically disadvantaged large numbers of poor children can challenge educators but schools in the richardson isd are going forward at pretty close to full speed the state has awarded richardson its second highest ranking the last two years thats a feat for a diverse district and requires large numbers of students progressing in math science reading language and social studies

3063185 our study suggests that even modest reductions in overall smoking rates may save lives in fact quitting smoking is the most important step smokers can take to improve their overall health and that of their loved ones people who do smoke should smoke outside the house to help protect themselves and their families from home fires and exposure to secondhand smoke a known human carcinogen
3063186 home fire deaths have declined during the past several decades and this decline has paralleled reductions in smoking
3063187 we work hard to keep our homes safe and it just makes good sense to help people understand that if they can change their smoking habits we may continue to reduce these tragedies
3063188 devotion signifies a life given or devoted to god he therefore is the devout man who lives no longer to his own will or the way and spirit of the world but to the sole will of god who considers god in everything who serves god in everything who makes all the parts of his common life parts of piety by doing everything in the name of god and under such rules as are conformable to his glory
3063189 kasatochi went from a quiet volcano to an explosive eruption within 24 hours and with very little warning
3063190 we are thankful our colleagues were able to get out before the eruption began they were rescued just in time by a local fishing boat
3063191 fortunately the existing seismic networks on nearby volcanoes picked up the activity at kasatochi volcano
3063192 they were installed with funding from the federal aviation administration to reduce the hazard to aviation from volcanic ash these networks were crucial in recognizing that this volcano had entered the first stage of a major eruption
3063193 our hope is to have monitoring equipment on all volcanoes that pose the greatest threats to public safety
3063194 satellite imagery is useful to see the big picture of what is happening and what is going into the atmosphere but direct instrumentation such as placing seismic monitors around a volcano will help give an early warning and give people more time to plan for hazardous events

3063209 ive worked at several different restaurants including iii forks and cool river caf and at those places you dont get a big return
3063210 a lot of the people who come during that week are people that arent typically going to put that restaurant into their rotation because of the price point ive seen it from the waiter perspective the staff in general at a place like that doesnt look forward to it its different for us at kennys because the price point is pretty much our average price anyway so we just pull things off our menu
3063211 after the list was announced we saw a spike in reservations and were sold out the first week
3063212 restaurant week doesnt hurt us at popolos because the average price for a 3 course meal here is 35 anyway
3063213 its a different thing for someplace like abacus where they have to do a whole entire separate restaurant week menu i have friends who work at places like that and they hate it for them its a loss of money
3063214 they get five to six requests a day every day its can we get a 100 gift certificate wed like a giveaway for our fund raiser its hard not to feel that if you dont do it youre missing the boat
3063215 something like restaurant week may not be hugely profitable but its enough to keep you afloat
3063216 with restaurants closing this year and the sagging economy its hard to deal with the decline you see in the summer especially for steakhouses

3063268 with our new mission and new direction we want to hear from those businesses that will ultimately be funding our cause through our industry partners annual fund and collision repair education campaign these responses will allow us to know more about how donors want to be recognized and how they are already interacting with schools we can then build upon what we learn from the results and improve the education foundations responsiveness to the industrys needs

3063270 the knowledge that the education foundation can gain from these industry responses will help us to understand our past present and future donors and we can learn about how to better the relationships that businesses currently have with schools

3063301 de weddenschap is al van lang geleden na het wereldrecord bij de ek kneep hij hem al flink hij zei de hele tijd dat wij zilver zouden winnen maar hij is die auto nu echt kwijt
3063302 we hebben die mannen duidelijk gemaakt dat ze pas na de wedstrijd weer welkom waren
3063303 die ploeg heeft met 4 2 van pakistan gewonnen dan weet je genoeg
3063304 die britten hebben gewoon een goed team dat wordt echt geen appeltje eitje voor ons zo hoort het natuurlijk ook we zijn hier wel op de olympische spelen
3063305 logisch dat je dan even uit je dak gaat als het allemaal goed afloopt maar nu gaan we ons voorbereiden op de britten dat is een fitte sterke ploeg die overal op het veld druk zet daarmee moeten we rekening houden maar we moeten er ook van kunnen profiteren
3063306 iedereen had er ook ongelooflijk veel zin in bij ons de eerste helft was niet fantastisch nee we bleken toch een beetje moeite met de vermeende last van de openingswedstrijd te hebben ook de olympische debutanten moesten even op gang komen we speelden voor de rust met iets te weinig lef we moesten er even doorheen komen
3063307 ik zag af en toe de concentratie verslappen dat wil ik gewoon niet hebben daarom heb ik mijn mond opengedaan misschien heeft het gewerkt de nul staat in elk geval op het scorebord
3063308 bij 16 10 achter hebben we de eerste set laten lopen
3063309 dat gepiel we spelen liever tegen teams die net als wij hard slaan we laten vandaag in ieder geval zien dat we als het niet loopt toch in staat zijn met hard werken er bovenop te komen daar zijn we goed in geworden
3063310 je moet fel beginnen lukt dat dan lopen we over ze heen ik denk dat we toch hier al hebben laten zien dat we tot de beste teams van het toernooi behoren
3063311 ik voelde me zo goed voor de partij maar er lukte vrijwel niets
3063312 we zakten helemaal weg we probeerden van alles maar er is geen moment geweest dat we echt in de wedstrijd zaten

3063330 it was tough because that was really big part of choosing where i wanted to go
3063331 industrial design is so broad and can go so many different ways academics were the main part of choosing notre dame i wouldnt say majoring in architecture and playing football is unrealistic but i would say it is really tough its really about what time youre willing to put into it its a lot of studio hours thats the tough part because pretty much half of my day is taken up by football
3063332 a lot of high school players especially high profile players think youre going to dominate just like high school but its a totally different game i just played my role learned techniques i feel its made me a better player coming from high school you dont really know what its about you get to camp and they start throwing all these things at you you realize its a little different game time is definitely different my first game i remember getting out there versus penn state in 2006 and the very first play it seemed the play was over before i even knew it it went so fast you hear about it but its really different once youve been out there
3063333 i feel like i always try to show my personality
3063334 at the cornerback position especially you have to have a little attitude you have to have a little spunk you have to have something behind you playing out there because its tough to play out there if you dont have a little fight about yourself youre not going to survive out there
3063335 i like to speak my mind but sometimes you have to hold back bite your tongue give respect where respect is due
3063336 we bumped heads a couple of times last year but weve worked things out

3063339 darrin played on the left side where i am right now after being on right
3063340 thats where most quarterback go most quarterbacks are right handed and you get a lot more balls thrown that way
3063341 the saga of a young elephants journey of discovery heroism and redemption which intersects with and renews the life of a reclusive old elephant who has always been an outsider
3063342 its a great look at what it means to be a fan at how nascar creeps its way into our everyday lives if you want proof that youre not the only nascar fan who is non southern non redneck non homophobic non fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype and youre not crazy for spending your hard earned money on little metal cars you should read this book
3063343 his writing is strong and clear his convictions spring from every page and his love of nascar is obvious i have a hard time imagining somebody having more fun writing anything than wilson must have had writing this book read it and youll know what i mean

3063348 por ning n canal nos ha llegado llamamiento alguno de los dirigentes de georgia a nombre del presidente de rusia
3063349 no sabemos nada pero antes los georgianos deben hacer otra cosa retirar sus tropas y armamentos y dejar de matar gente en osetia del sur
3063350 georgia est dispuesta a cesar el fuego en la zona de tsjinvali e iniciar negociaciones con rusia
3063351 me he dirigido al presidente de rusia dmitri medv dev con la propuesta de detener juntos esta demencia
3063352 el pleno respeto de la soberan a y de la integridad territorial de georgia
3063353 restablecimiento de la situaci n que prevalec a anteriormente sobre el terreno que implica la retirada de las fuerzas rusas y georgianas a las posiciones anteriores con f rmulas de acompa amiento internacional
3063354 creo que est absolutamente claro que las aspiraciones de georgia a la hora de entrar en la otan est n dictadas por sus intentos de involucrar a otros pa ses en sus sangrientas aventuras
3063355 cese inmediato de la agresi n contra osetia del sur
3063356 violaciones de los acuerdos anteriores de paz y alto el fuego
3063357 un intento de involucrar a otros pa ses y pueblos en sus sanguinarias aventuras
3063358 creo que esto es ahora obvio tanto en georgia y rusia como en el resto del mundo
3063359 las acciones de las autoridades georgianas en osetia del sur son por supuesto un crimen y ante todo un crimen contra su propio pueblo
3063360 asest un duro golpe a la integridad territorial de georgia
3063361 seg n la informaci n de nuestras fuerzas de paz en osetia del sur georgia contin a utilizando la fuerza militar y a este respecto no podemos ni siquiera considerar este documento firmado por el presidente georgiano mijail saakashvil
3063362 es una pena que algunos de nuestros socios intenten impedir nuestras operaciones
3063363 hablo de estados unidos que ha movilizado sus aviones de transporte militar para trasladar al contingente georgiano en irak hacia la zona de conflicto

3063381 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
3063382 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
3063383 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3063384 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3063385 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
3063386 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore

3063525 i n a nation in which 66 of the voting age population is overweight and 32 is obese could sen obamas skinniness be a liability despite his visits to waffle houses ice cream parlors and greasy spoon diners around the country his slim physique just might have some americans wondering whether he is truly like them
3063526 during a july family appearance on access hollywood sen obamas 7 year old daughter sasha revealed that her dad doesnt like ice cream or sweets everybody should like ice cream she said

3063545 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
3063546 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
3063547 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
3063548 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
3063549 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
3063550 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
3063551 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
3063552 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
3063553 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
3063554 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
3063555 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
3063556 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
3063557 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy

3063559 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
3063560 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

3063600 completely dedicated to the lord and therefore totally dedicated to man
3063601 on the other hand and this is even more important today the multiplicity of charisms and the fact that together they make up the church
3063602 if we truly believe in eternal life and if we believe that god helps us
3063603 have the courage to limit themselves and the clarity to set their priorities
3063604 the time a priest spends with the lord and therefore having time for prayer
3063605 to learn what is truly essential to learn where my presence is truly needed as a priest and where i cannot delegate to anybody and at the same time i should humbly accept that there are many things and moments that require my presence but that cannot be done because i recognize my own limitations i think that such humility will be understood by people
3063606 and with this there is something else i should understand how to delegate and call others to collaborate
3063607 a true community of brothers who should sustain and help one another
3063608 isolation in loneliness and sadness and therefore it is important we get together regularly
3063609 no priest is a priest all by himself we are a presbyterate and only in this communion with the bishop can each one carry out his service
3063610 when i was younger i was stricter i said the sacraments are the sacraments of the faith and therefore where there is no faith there is no praxis of faith and thus the sacrament cannot be conferred and i discussed this latter with my priests when i was archbishop of munich as time has gone on i have come to understand that we must follow always the example of the lord who was very open to those on the fringes of israel at that time as well he was a lord of mercy very open according to many official authorities with sinners embracing them and allowing himself to be welcomed at their dinners attracting them to communion with him
3063611 if we can perceive even a flicker of desire for communion in the church a desire also of these children who want to enter into communion with jesus i think it is fair to be more generous naturally of course one aspect of our catechesis should be to make it understood that communion first communion is not an ending event but rather demands a continual friendship with jesus a journey with jesus
3063612 in these sense naturally we should do everything possible in the context of the preparation of the sacraments in order to reach the parents as well and thus make them aware of the journey they are on with the children they should help their children to follow their own desire to enter into friendship with jesus

3063656 but when it comes to the anaerobic digester i must confess i dont fully understand the concept and how it fits into the neighborhood and i was a biology major in college
3063657 these people are all going to be champions of composting but in terms of supporting the anaerobic digester im not sure theyre all there yet not all of them are in lockstep with the idea
3063658 they were more interested in hydrogen and not so much digesters
3063659 we could reduce waste coming out of the neighborhood by 80 percent its important that we first make that composting program a success

3063775 tbilisi was bombed bombs hit the village of kojori and makhata mountain
3063776 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3063777 it seems that this will not change anything but will move us away from resolving the situation
3063778 saddam hussein of course needed to be hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3063779 but not the current georgian leadership which in less than an hour drove tanks through children and old people burned people alive in their homes these leaders need to be protected
3063780 saakashvili is no longer a man that we can deal with
3063781 he must be punished for breaching international law he is responsible for many war crimes
3063782 georgian troops have violated international conventions we are talking of genocide and ethnic cleansing
3063783 give us an update on the situation and we also expect allies to assess the situation in georgia following the appeal that the nato secretary general repeated yesterday for an immediate ceasefire

3063785 the power of the vote overcoming the power of the gun
3063786 it has been a wonderful experience and we feel right now we have committed

3063790 i figured that coming back to the olympics being what i came here for is getting a medal which is going to be a lot of attention
3063791 a lot of people will be saying we have got to pay attention to this guy because he is at a lower weight class and he also can fight
3063792 the committee has considered the facts and evidence as presented to it on august 8 and 10 2008 in the two respective cases
3063793 there was no common purpose among the party anc councillors under the mayor

3063795 if they are so smart how come they dont land in on the lawns of the white house and communicate
3063796 something really bizarre is happening in the skies over the u k
3063797 ive been dealing in sightings for 30 years and we currently have something very real which mankind cannot explain
3063798 we usually only get between 10 and 20 reports a week
3063799 there are a lot of sightings around the atherton tablelands ravensbourne tully and dalby
3063800 id say that is because the sky is clearer and lights in the sky are easier to see the sunshine coast also has a little bit of activity
3063801 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

3063803 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
3063804 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3063805 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions
3063806 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
3063807 any measure by the european union ahead of the end of talks between iran and the five security council veto holders plus germany will be unacceptable

3063810 kami berpikir bahwa pihak polisi dan militer bisa bersikap dengan cara yang beda wajah mereka terlihat seperti batu
3063811 mereka membuat takut para turis kita tak bisa terus seperti ini sebagai tambahan mereka membawa senjata dan itu hanya membuat segalanya lebih buruk
3063812 masalah mental menjadi masalah utama kami tiap kembali ke lapangan setelah tiga tahun kami masih saja melakukan kesalahan yang sama dan hal ini sungguh menganggu karena kami berusaha mencari solusinya
3063813 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3063814 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3063815 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3063816 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3063817 sacrifice your first born your only begotten son light the fires stir the cauldron fill the coffers and the coffins

3063819 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3063820 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3063821 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3063822 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3063823 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3063824 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3063825 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3063826 it is obvious the russian invasion had been planned for months and months and months the timing of this intervention has been chosen deliberately with regards to the olympics
3063827 the world has a moral duty to stop the madness
3063828 it is so clear what has happened we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of a democratic independent country
3063829 please wake up everybody and make your position and speak with a united voice we are seeing the cold blooded pre meditated murder of a small country
3063830 according to information from peacekeepers in south ossetia georgia continues to use military force and in this regard we cannot consider this document
3063831 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3063832 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone
3063833 the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3063834 there are fears of propaganda and of disinformation its difficult to form an objective picture
3063835 if air space is violated as well we will be forced to respond appropriately and to destroy those who enter the safety zone
3063836 the 1992 treaty signed by the georgian side clearly defines the boundaries of the russian peacekeeping contingents responsibility no tasks to enter georgia have been assigned to the peacekeeping contingent
3063837 the u s military instructors directly command and coordinate actions of mercenaries without being involved in actual fighting the source specified according to intelligence data there are roughly 1 000 military instructors of the united states in georgia
3063838 task force of russia has annihilated a few groups of mercenaries some of mercenaries have been captured and investigators are working with them the source said
3063839 we have detained 10 agents of the georgian special services who were spying on military facilities and preparing terrorist attacks including on russian territory

3063867 over tot de orde van de dag ontzettend veel geneukt dus meneer neukte niet om klaar te komen maar om te stoten overwogen om net te doen alsof ik moe was maar dat leek me net iets te onprofessioneel toen hem maar een paar keer klaar laten komen waardoor hij uiteindelijk ook een beetje uitgeput begon te raken en nog tevreden was ook
3063868 compensou o recuo acumulado de 0 4 nos dois meses anteriores
3063869 persoonlijke gaaf initiatief inderdaad volg het al enige tijd en vind het concept ik zou het aantal trends tot de top 5 beperken deze zijn
3063870 georgian peacekeepers opened fire on the russian peacekeepers with whom they are supposed to work together to carry out their mission of maintaining peace in this region
3063871 you will be a part of our country and well keep bombing you till your grateful for that fact
3063872 russians are the bad guys so the georgians must be the good guys plus theyre pro western
3063873 oh no russias poor defenseless neighbors are being oppressed again
3063874 what are the implications of this conflict for the broader region i e turkey armenia possibly iran
3063875 russias president earlier promised to defend his citizens in south ossetia moscows defence ministry said more than 10 of its peacekeeping troops in south ossetia had been killed and 30 wounded in the georgian offensive at least 15 civilians are also reported dead
3063876 georgia accuses russia of arming the separatists moscow denies the claim
3063877 it wont happen obviously but the ioc should condemn the russian attack and send its delegation of athletes home using a global festival of sport as a cover for a nationalistic land grab and the murder of civilians is disgusting
3063878 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovreign georgian territory
3063879 while i know the olympics and particularly the ioc falls far short of its ideals sport and politics should be separate
3063880 yulia latynina is known for her sharp and polemic statements
3063881 what we have here is a full scale russian invasion of georgian territory
3063882 you can argue that the president of south ossetia who wants independence from georgia is deliberately provoking tbilisi and is trying to suck russia in
3063883 forgive seven times seven and then again turn the other cheek
3063884 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
3063885 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
3063886 i think what is at stake here is the post cold war order
3063887 this is not about democracy vs dictature brave freedom lovers vs evil oppressors but a nasty brawl by power hungry figures on both sides with large slices of corruption the fact that this is turned into a cold war like conflict between good and evil is a domestic political play by some in washington to reinforce their power and push certain policies that have little to do with russia or georgia
3063888 youre saying something that contradicts or complicates my view of the situation therefore you must have a personal stake and in fact are probably a member of group x
3063889 georgias been oppressing its minorities ever since theyve had the chance
3063890 this is not about democracy vs dictature brave freedom lovers vs evil oppressors but a nasty brawl by power hungry figures on both sides with large slices of corruption
3063891 so just stay fat and dumb and shut up and smile
3063892 it is crudely simplistic to cast russia as the sole villain in the clashes over south ossetia the west would be wise to stay out
3063893 actuaries are urging policy makers to raise the retirement age as the first step to shoring up social security and keeping younger workers from bearing the brunt of painful tax increases
3063894 we think that if you dig in and make these changes now it gives people time to plan
3063895 it gives people time to anticipate that now im age 35 im looking at an age 68 or 69 retirement for social security and that gives you a lot of years to plan for it
3063896 isnt going to solve the whole problem and likely would be part of a package of solutions
3063897 the likely future behaviour of government towards its wholly owned subsidiary
3063898 even a minor negative change in our assumptions surrounding government support would put downward pressure
3063899 these governments recent actions also need to be balanced in the context of previous years where eskom appeared to lack strategic direction and financial support from government
3063900 moodys would need to see a track record of irrefutably supportive behaviour from government before it could consider upwardly revising its assessment of support
3063901 although were deeply disappointed with the downgrade eskom retains its investment grade rating and will have continued access to local and global capital markets
3063902 we are satisfied that progress has been made on all critical fronts including shareholder support and a tariff path that places eskom on course to achieve long term financial sustainability
3063903 this will enhance the ability of eskom and the power sector in general to deliver this massive build programme which is central to south africas growth and development
3063904 eskom is disappointed that the evidence of this progress was not adequate to satisfy moodys and we look forward to demonstrating that eskom is financially sustainable and in partnership with the broader stakeholder base capable of the huge task ahead
3063905 moodys expects eskoms credit metrics to improve to levels consistent with an investment grade bca only after several years in the future through returns on its investment programme and as increased tariffs feed through to its revenue
3063906 even a minor negative change in our assumptions surrounding government support would put downward pressure on the baa2 ratings

3063908 the punk ethos as stated by mark perry here is a chord
3063909 army cookbooks are extremely rare and i have never seen one which dates from victorian times before
3063910 it is incredible that smiths army records have survived after all they are 132 years old and the cookbook was written 118 years ago
3063911 i am happy to sell them because i dont think my son would be interested and i dont want them to be thrown away if anything happens to me

3063920 the sanakoyev administrations territory to insignificance or even remove it from south ossetia altogether
3063921 to dissuade nato from approving a membership action plan map for georgia at the alliances december 2008 or april 2009 meetings
3063922 enlightened self interest approach would call for further steps towards conflict resolution in abkhazia and south ossetia
3063923 it is in russias interest to continue to support the domestic stability and territorial integrity of its neighbors
3063924 to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
3063925 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
3063926 more damage to american democracy promotion than a dozen pervez musharrafs ever could have done

3063931 the state is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
3063932 when somebody persuades me that i am wrong i change my mind what do you do
3063933 whatever it is that government does sensible americans would prefer that the government do it to someone else this is the idea behind foreign policy
3063934 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing
3063935 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity
3063936 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with inherent and inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governme walt whitman

3063948 pooooooooooor meeeeeeee poor creationists everyone is out to get us i suffer so much because of my message of truth poooor meeeeeeee
3063949 im just so disappointed in ou students and how closed minded they are
3063950 regardless of the soundness of bill dembskis talk his claim that the students were parroting their profs was probably correct
3063951 the massive storm surge produced by katrina even though it had weakened from category 5 intensity can be generally explained by the huge size of the storm
3063952 like the ozone crisis public awareness has been the second step
3063953 the drought here has been absolutely instrumental in changing public opinion on climate change even though there is a good case in this particular instance for saying it is natural variability more than climate change
3063954 so itll be a degree or two warmer so what itll make for some nice comfy springtime weather im looking forward to it
3063955 if the drought does not break there will be a time when good quality livestock will be harder to find and retail meat prices may rise

3063959 for many years social conservatives have claimed that marriage exists solely for the purpose of procreation the time has come for these conservatives to be dosed with their own medicine
3063960 if same sex couples should be barred from marriage because they can not have children together it follows that all couples who cannot or will not have children together should equally be barred from marriage
3063961 thats not a valid equitable reason lots of married straight couples do not have children by accident or design think up an equitable reason if you can
3063962 lets make up an initiative that will say people can only be married if they have children everyone will see how silly that is
3063963 how many learned books of fairyology and hobgoblinology have you read
3063964 i believe x to be the epistemological equivalent of y since you dont read learned books on y or such books dont exist you cannot criticize me for my lack of reading in x
3063965 i cannot know for certain but i think that god is very improbable and i live my life on the assumption that he is not there
3063966 how many learned books of fairyology and hobgoblinology have you read
3063967 theological writings of believers and the writings of philosophers of religion
3063968 how can you reconcile a belief that jesus rose from the dead with what we know of science
3063969 i doubt that religion can survive deep understanding the shallows are its natural habitat cranks and fundamentalists are too often victimised as scapegoats for religion in general it is only quite recently that christianity reinvented itself in non fundamentalist guise and islam has yet to do so see ibn warraqs excellent book why i am not a muslim moonies and scientologists get a bad press but they just havent been around as long as the accepted religions theology is a respectable discipline when it studies such subjects as moral philosophy the psychology of religious belief and above all biblical history and literature like bertie wooster my knowledge of the bible is above average i seem to know ecclesiastes and the song of solomon almost by heart i think that the bible as literature should be a compulsory part of the national curriculum you cant understand english literature and culture without it but insofar as theology studies the nature of the divine it will earn the right to be taken seriously when it provides the slightest smallest smidgen of a reason for believing in the existence of the divine meanwhile we should devote as much time to studying serious theology as we devote to studying serious fairies and serious unicorns
3063970 shouldnt the burdon of proof be on those that claim theology is worthy of study
3063971 formulating beliefs in such an intellectually irresponsible manner that they are nearly guaranteed to be false
3063972 how come descartes kant and hume to name only a few found it necessary to deal with the argument
3063973 why do professors of evolutionary biology find it necessary to deal with intelligent design in their classrooms is it the merit of the argument or something else
3063974 and in a single breathtakingly inane comment you demonstrate a complete lack of knowledge of how for example descartes uses the ontological argument to further his own come back when you have some grounding in the history of philosophy
3063975 descartes kant and hume found it necessary to deal with the argument
3063976 you have no reason to believe there is any such thing as evolution
3063977 sure but look at all this great writing weve done about it
3063978 substance what substance what exactly do you mean by essence
3063979 is there any writing that both philosophers and middlebrows are likely to find satisfying examples please
3063980 those of us who teach history of philosophy appeal to the principle of charity simply put it asks students to realize that though an argument may look easy to refute or just plain wrong there is probably something philosophically worthwhile contained within so applying the principle here i will claim that any confusion perhaps comes from your reading rather than anselm
3063981 youre admitting here that you give theological arguments presupposed importance why i cant think of anything except the argument from authority
3063982 instead of saying you must not understand the argument why not ask
3063983 could someone please describe those sophisticated arguments for the existence of god that dawkins omits
3063984 also for all those people who criticize dawkins for not being well versed in christian theology do they claim to be well versed in the philosophy of all other religions
3063985 similarly have all christian apologists immersed themselves completely in atheist or christian for that matter literature before they criticize atheism i dont see it in books by ken miller and francis collins but surprisingly they seem to escape criticism
3063986 well hes got no clothes anyway so it doesnt matter
3063987 the huge numbers of believers who hold something like the theology i outlined above can thus be conveniently lumped with rednecks who murder abortionists and malign homosexuals as far as such outrages go however the god delusion does a very fine job indeed the two most deadly texts on the planet apart perhaps from donald rumsfelds emails are the bible and the koran and dawkins as one the best of liberals as well as one of the worst has done a magnificent job over the years of speaking out against that particular strain of psychopathology known as fundamentalism whether texan or taliban he is right to repudiate the brand of mealy mouthed liberalism which believes that one has to respect other peoples silly or obnoxious ideas just because they are other peoples in its admirably angry way the god delusion argues that the status of atheists in the us is nowadays about the same as that of gays fifty years ago the book is full of vivid vignettes of the sheer horrors of religion fundamentalist or otherwise nearly 50 per cent of americans believe that a glorious second coming is imminent and some of them are doing their damnedest to bring it about but dawkins could have told us all this without being so appallingly bitchy about those of his scientific colleagues who disagree with him and without being so theologically illiterate he might also have avoided being the second most frequently mentioned individual in his book if you count god as an individual
3063988 i think the biggest risk is the competition between the program groups that are adding things to the mix
3063989 for instance right now you have linq to sql and the entity framework which seem to solve some of the same problems with very different approaches
3063990 microsoft is notorious for introducing overlapping technologies people look at microsoft and assume that they will err on fragmentation vs controlled choice
3063991 we are looking at factored subsets of net that make good sense for specific scenarios
3063992 since framework teams at microsoft can develop managed code software so much faster than they could using c their own efforts are dramatically accelerated they no longer have the time to do coordination with other teams such coordination would quickly become the bottleneck to getting their own efforts out the door in a culture such as microsoft which values shipped software above all else such a bottleneck will by necessity be bypassed

3063994 so you gotta wonder what the management at london boutique hockley known for its furs were on when they draped a model in a full length mink coat and stella mccartnety lingerie and then ran the ad in vogue stella went absolutely ballistic when she saw it a source at ms mccartneys store in mayfair told the mail on sunday i have never seen her so angry she hit the roof and said that she planned to sue she allows her accessories to be lent to shoots all the time but she would never ever allow anything of hers to go to a fashion house that deals exclusively with fur hockley not surprisingly has pulled the ad

3064025 after the fighting in the city we found several bodies of citizens of the baltic states and ukraine later on i was informed that the bodies of several black men were found at the scene of a battle near school number 12
3064026 the town looks like stalingrad during ww2 with fallen trees power lines burnt georgian tanks all over the streets the dead bodies of georgian soldiers are lying everywhere
3064027 never before have so many people been ab amp oned at once

3064046 we call upon all parties involved to observe an immediate and total cease fire and enter negotiations to bring an end to the conflict and to resolve the underlying issues which have led to it
3064047 we are also appealing to the united nations to the european union and to the organisation for security and cooperation in europe to put their full weight behind the quest for a peaceful negotiated end to this conflict

3064077 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3064078 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3064079 continued aggression against georgia and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond south ossetia will only serve to damage russias international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe
3064080 ich kam ber die nah und landschaftsfotografie an den akt das ist spannender als blumen zu fotografieren
3064081 vor 14 jahren hatten meine damalige tanzpartnerin und ich die idee aktfotos zu machen uns inspirierte ein foto das wir nachmachen wollten wir hatten eine menge spa und daraus habe ich mich weiterentwickelt und entdeckt was mir liegt
3064082 nein ich finde es unheimlich spannend leute mit meiner kamera zu beobachten ich begebe mich mit meinem fotoapparat auf entdeckungstour der jeweiligen k rper
3064083 die m nner zieren sich h ufig anders als die frauen die viel offener f r das spiel mit der kamera sind
3064084 ich bewundere auch die arbeiten von jim rakete der macht klare sachliche fotos unter anderem von musikern toller typ mit dem ich gern mal ein bier trinken w rde

3064088 es geht bei den unber hrten nicht nur um sex es geht darum partnerschaften aufzubauen ngste zu berwinden und da kann der besuch im puff nichts ausrichten
3064089 um so die sch chternheit zu berwinden und die f higkeit des k rperkontakts auszubauen
3064090 a clear indication of how the u s is changing and this is a trend that is much more important than just the ratings
3064091 who are the next big things in rock or alternate music

3064100 die hertie filialen in barmbek bramfeld und langenhorn haben eine gute chance weitergef hrt zu werden darin waren sich alle beteiligten des hertie gipfels einig
3064101 der insolvenzverwalter will die h user erhalten und f r sie k mpfen
3064102 die dortigen 36 mitarbeiter sollen schnellstm glich bei hamburger einzelh ndlern untergebracht werden

3064104 der schlimmste fall w re nat rlich dass ein haus in hamburg aufgegeben werden muss
3064105 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3064106 i think we look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3064107 an den ersten beiden tagen konnten wir uns gegen starke gegnerinnen der golfclubs gutenhof und linz klar durchsetzen das hat uns schon zuversichtlich gemacht aber wir wussten nat rlich dass im finale mit dellach der dreifache staatsmeister auf uns wartet und es war klar dass dies ein harter brocken werden w rde
3064108 i think the highlight was getting my picture taken with the teams
3064109 its just a very energetic feeling you know they represent the best of u s athletics and they were really excited about their events and theyre full of hope it was just a very uplifting experience
3064110 its an international games there are people from all over the world watching and not cheering madly
3064111 i was watching michael phelps after the anchor leg touched
3064112 the whole thing is genuine thats the good thing about the olympics
3064113 theyre genuinely pleased that the president came to support them
3064114 and i really believe that it helps them realize the country is supporting them a lot of people are pulling for them
3064115 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3064116 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3064117 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3064118 russia is a nuclear state they are very close to this region and we are very far away
3064119 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3064120 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3064121 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3064122 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
3064123 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3064124 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3064125 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3064126 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
3064127 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
3064128 we wanted our daughter to know her parents were married that was the big thing for us
3064129 our journey to parenthood was not easy cheap or fun
3064130 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter
3064131 all the realms involved with men are much more complex
3064132 for future generations knowing they can fall in love get married have a child absolutely that will become a way of life more than it is
3064133 as a couple with kids you really see the importance of it trying to get as many protections as you can
3064134 my relatives were screaming with excitement when they found out we were going to be parents
3064135 i think we still have something to prove to show america we can do a great job with these kids
3064136 legally being able to get married will help in some states but not others
3064137 its not going to happen in new york as the law stands now
3064138 you cant bring the surrogate into the state but we can make the arrangements fly the client elsewhere
3064139 there are more couples that had been holding off because of the marriage situation who are now starting to show up
3064140 adoption is not getting any easier surrogacy is getting easier
3064141 what weve tried to do is have consent forms that make it very clear what the intentions of the people are
3064142 whos going to be the mom whos going to be the dad what might happens if relationship ends if someone dies
3064143 if you dont have an exit strategy the usual result is that you have potentially several years of litigation which is extremely damaging to the child
3064144 its incumbent on everyone to be very thoughtful about entering these arrangements
3064145 as gay men so much depends on where you live what your social support system is like
3064146 our child will go to school with other kids with gay parents
3064147 i had a job option upstate but i knew hed be only kid like that there
3064148 id completely given up on the idea of ever having a child
3064149 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3064150 you have helped build this movement from the bottom up and barack wants you to be the first to know his choice
3064151 once youve signed up please forward this e mail to your friends family and co workers to let them know about this special opportunity no other campaign has done this before you can be part of this important moment
3064152 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
3064153 obama started negative campaigning on john mccain long before we started punching back and i think a lot of our effort is really to get back into this game try and galvanize some of the public attention back onto this race make sure everybody understands theres two people in this race not just one and i think weve been successful in doing that
3064154 the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
3064155 alirezaei nada en el carril 1 y el representante del r gimen sionista por israel lo hace en el 7 por lo que no se ver n las caras
3064156 married people are still healthier than unmarried people but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
3064157 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those social groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3064158 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
3064159 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3064160 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
3064161 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
3064162 god help us is we ever go to war with them
3064163 we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
3064164 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
3064165 we are now in a fight against the great russia
3064166 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own 38 minutes ago 7 6 nothing in what cheney said implies war or any specific threat
3064167 russian state controlled propaganda made it to the front page of digg
3064168 fannie mae and freddie mac both just announced multi billion dollar quarterly losses along with record losses being reported by most corporations
3064169 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3064170 perhaps when the next great war comes we may see that sight unprecedented in all history a jingo with a bullet hole in him
3064171 i cant think of a time when weve had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the caspian
3064172 do they have a legit gripe how many times have we totally screwed them over in the past are their problems largely our fault
3064173 this country might have oil resources so lets piss off the one country we spent 50 years trying to avoid a fight with

3064179 we do a lot here care for them ride them train them pretty much everything the horses need until we can find them a home
3064180 we keep horses an average of about 30 days but sometimes longer the barns are always full we can only take so many there is a long waiting list and we only accept horses from finger lakes so you can see the need for more programs like this across the country
3064181 aside from doing our part here our goal is to get enough exposure so that other racetracks will see what were doing and join us in opening their own adoption facilities
3064182 shipping horses is expensive so some owners are grateful for what we do
3064183 but there are still many that are sold and end up in the wrong hands we can only do so much
3064184 id like all racetracks to know that this is a very replicable process we are a small racetrack so if we can do it anyone can its just a matter of people taking responsibility and caring
3064185 one of the things that made this possible for us is the management at finger lakes which has been very supportive they were made aware of the problem of unwanted horses and decided to help us do something about it thats the first step
3064186 pak jk mencoret nama mereka semua kalau mereka mengajukan diri menjadi caleg

3064214 george bush has f ked up so bad that hes made it hard for a white man to run for president
3064215 for gods sake woman get off your ass and do some damn parenting
3064216 glad to see you could make it to one of our ministry broadcasts detective we might even save you if you open your heart to the message
3064217 somehow someones been tipping off members of your congregation about questions and circumstances of the melissa anson murder
3064218 this is where i prepare to deliver my message of gods infinite love and patience
3064219 this is the police detective who thinks someone here mightve had something to do with that poor lamb melissa ansons murder this is detective joseph
3064220 would you mind if i came on your show and made a plea to your audience or do you still call them your flock
3064221 i will not be the subject of ridicule nor will i let some depraved unstable blackmailer denounce or sully the good name of this congregation stop that
3064222 detective we minister to the shut ins the elderly the sick maybe you think one of
3064223 i cant come on your show and ask for assistance in solving this crime
3064224 im turning over the television ministry to the lincoln parish evangelical church until
3064225 until there is someone who can be held accountable for this murder and we this church are no longer under the scrutiny of you chief detective
3064226 and i want to find the man who murdered a thirteen year old girl
3064227 detective joseph the sins of man also include the sins of woman
3064228 judge simpson seems to think the police havent focused enough attention there yet
3064229 we minister to everyone who wants no needs to hear the word of god
3064230 and i ah have been the willing instrument of jesus ah delivering that holy message because jesus ah called out to me
3064231 no no listen i will step aside as long as there is a shadow of doubt within the police department of this great city that someone within our congregation might have been involved in the heinous crime we have all been witness to
3064232 reverend watts doesnt allow um doesnt like anybody eating when hes getting ready it distracts him
3064233 so i will not give in to the demon force ah cause i walk with the lord ah
3064234 because a wayward young sheep an unwary lamb ah caught
3064235 right here in our community no doubt by some minion of satanic ideologies ah
3064236 because she came to us and we failed to deliver her from her own mortal nature we all of us have fallen under the insinuating scrutiny of the philistines
3064237 he was shot by another member of the congregation a young man driven by a young mans impulsive nature
3064238 but a young man who wanted to exercise the justice that only god can truly exercise god ah in his perfect omnipotence knew that david jason was not the kind of man who could kill one of gods lambs ah but he stood accused by an impulsive young police man ah but we forgive this police man ah the same way we forgive young timmy regan we forgive timmy because we know that in his heart he only wanted to be an instrument of holy will
3064239 and not i say not the hope of this lambs salvation
3064240 but well forgive him because christians have always been persecuted ah always been suspected ah always been envied ah because were going to sit ah next to god next to jesus ah with the holy spirit in attendance
3064241 because we christians have to watch out for ourselves in this place a place filled with false idols moral penury religious sects of all colors dishonesty and the devils own distractions created only to bring us to doubt all because well receive the holy communion with god and some will not ah
3064242 so as of tomorrow i will turn over this hour of the public faith christian network to my esteemed fellow pastor jimmy sundae and he will continue to minister while i defend this innocent congregation
3064243 now were focused on the weak demand side of the equation
3064244 there was this thought process that the high price of energy didnt matter to china and other countries but were finding that thats not the case
3064245 i am always amazed when i hear people saying that sport creates goodwill between the nations and that if only the common peoples of the world could meet one another at football or cricket they would have no inclination to meet on the battlefield even if one didnt know from concrete examples the 1936 olympic games for instance that international sporting contests lead to orgies of hatred one could deduce it from general principles
3064246 in england and the united states games were built up into a heavily financed activity capable of attracting vast crowds and rousing savage passions and the infection spread from country to country it is the most violently combative sports football and boxing that have spread the widest there cannot be much doubt that the whole thing is bound up with the rise of nationalism that is with the lunatic modern habit of identifying oneself with large power units and seeing everything in terms of competitive prestige
3064247 it was an extremely good bout that was full of emotions emotions i have never felt before emotions i felt strongly during and in the lead up to this match
3064248 i fought against some very strong competitors my son asked me for medal but he didnt ask for a particular one anyway heres a medal
3064249 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3064250 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3064251 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3064252 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3064253 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3064254 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3064255 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3064256 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3064257 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3064258 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3064259 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3064260 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3064261 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3064262 now hes been at the shelter for over a month
3064263 her coloring is unique the deepest shade of chocolate brown like her mama in the sunshine that appears black like her daddy when she is not in the sun her personality is typical of a lab sweet laid back very affectionate and loves everyone except cats emily anne lost it all in the divorce her family the children she loved her home and her brother dog she still has a big heart full of love and with a little attention and affection from the right person she will again be ready to shower the world with it
3064264 people moved into an apartment that would not allow her to follow she is good girl that will sit when you ask her two and offers a paw in return for some petting she gets along well with other dogs
3064265 at least two have black spots on their tongues so maybe a little chow
3064266 mostly enjoys eating and sleeping but is quickly learning about toys that squeak his favorite toy is his rope and he loves a good game of tug o war
3064267 my son will be able to be involved in ronnies life
3064268 we are very grateful to everyone that helped and everyone that contacted me wanting to help i have learned through this experience that if you need help of any kind just speak up and say so there are still many caring people in the world that will help
3064269 two precious about 5 week old kittens are in need of new homes they were probably dumped in this rescuers yard as she cannot find the mother she the rescuer thinks theyre both boys one is solid black and calm and loves her dog the other is black and white and is feisty and hisses at her dog
3064270 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3064271 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3064272 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3064273 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3064274 with an economic advantage it would not have had under normal market conditions
3064275 was paid 326 414 euros in five months or 2 170 euros a day
3064276 was paid 1 536 million euros equal to 6 400 euros a day while alitalia lost 626 million euros
3064277 like girls guys everyone there just wore sneakers and cool t shirts
3064278 theres a lot of people that are catching on but theres still people who walk in the door and are like what is this you know what i mean
3064279 ive met so many cool people that have given me so much positive energy
3064280 whether its customers who have walked through the door or fellow business owners or buyers its just creating a network of people that are living their dream and stepping outside the box and being creative with what they do thats definitely the best part every day
3064281 those are classics now they make all different colors and materials its just really cool to wear a sneaker as a fashion statement that goes back to your roots of playing basketball back in the day

3064291 ive seen a lot of people struggle with microphone stands in the past and ive seen many musicians trip over them onstage and in the studio i just knew that there had to be a better way

3064293 you are smart people why would you do this to me
3064294 yeah everybodys using it these days to increase their yield

3064322 i have dreamed of this day since i was a little girl
3064323 the journey here was harder than i could have ever imagined
3064324 its amazing especially considering how debilitated she was pre transplant
3064325 she has done very very well she is the reason we go to work every morning the wedding is a huge event for our lung transplant team its the dream we have for all our patients a normal life
3064326 these are the odds but if the odds were in place carrie wouldnt be here anyway
3064327 there was a point where i was ready to go
3064328 it was a week where i couldnt have food or water zach has lost one friend in a motorcycle accident ive lost at least 20 just by knowing so many people who were sick
3064329 today we celebrate many many miracles incredible generosity faith medical science and the fact that life always gives us second and sometimes third and fourth chances
3064330 it is a miracle and it really starts with the donor family lung transplantation is in its infancy its a procedure of the 1990s and were still battling problems we dont understand
3064331 in some ways it seems like another life in other ways it seems like just yesterday
3064332 im connected to it emotionally but im feeling the best i ever have
3064333 in the movies if someones sick and theyre honking and hacking ill move
3064334 they ask me to relive my experience im cautious what do i tell them and not tell them afterward i lie down and im done for the day
3064335 its truly like a brother and sister but on a different level
3064336 i dont ever forget that what i have is because of joel

3064343 i believe 100 per cent there is something i will not say it is mande burung because we have not found it but as long as there is no proof we will keep looking
3064344 there are many stories in our myths about elves or whatever but the mande burung is not part of that folklore
3064345 the creature was on the rock he was playing with a stone hitting it against the rock it was black
3064346 it was just a few seconds that i saw it i was very scared

3064407 i knew we were better on the long run so i took my time waiting for it to come back to me unfortunately i never got that chance its a tough way to end the race
3064408 ive been the leading player in europe for six years it is a big step to start competing on a different level im world no 3 ive got phil mickelson ive got tiger ahead of me it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know the only way to focus on doing that is to focus on what im doing
3064409 obviously this was a different win than the one at birkdale
3064410 at birkdale i was very comfortable with my game here that wasnt the case i went into the afternoon not knowing what lay ahead
3064411 unfortunately sometimes things dont want to go the right way
3064412 when things are going your way those things happen the best thing about it is i cant ask myself for anything else
3064413 i felt an edge in terms of my experience in terms of my ability to take an opportunity when it comes around i know the crowd was thinking this was sergios major its a great story like greg norman was at birkdale but you cant left yourself get drawn into that
3064414 i knew that i had the opportunity to get the putt in first and that was important i knew if i holed it i probably would win the pga if i missed sergio would probably win the pga
3064415 weve been encouraging black men to get screened at age 40 or 45 for more than a decade yet only one third of these high risk men reported being tested
3064416 you dont pay attention man thats why your respects the size of your attention span dilla said it best
3064417 we just overpowered the race track it pretty much canceled out our chances of getting into the top 10 for the countdown and thats what weve been shooting for all year i never thought wed be in this spot but we are it was a big blow and were pretty much mathematically out of it
3064418 the upside is that were qualified well for the 100 000 showdown bonus event in seventh at indianapolis and that gives us some hope weve got eight more races left in the season and were just going to keep getting after it there are still races to be won well go to reading in a week and see what happens
3064419 i was hoping for a top 10 or top 15 finish so i would get an autographed hat from the king
3064420 but maybe since there are no marks on the car he still might give me one i sure hope so it was an honor to drive for the pettys
3064421 its tough getting into someone elses car its a little uncomfortable without any real practice
3064422 you just dont drive it like you drive your own car at least i didnt i was about half the boris today i just drove a conservative race and brought them home a consistent finish with some points if it were my car i would have definitely been more aggressive overall it was a fun day not a mark on the car
3064423 yesterday in the nationwide race i did nothing but make mistakes
3064424 it was a great day for our big red slim pack dodge charger the crew did a great job and we had a fantastic car we got a little messed up on the second pit stop im not sure what happened the pit stop itself was ok but the pit lane that we were in screwed us up a bit and we lost some spots when you have to go back out and pass five or six guys that youve already passed you just kill your brakes and makes it hard to run good laps other than that we had a really clean race
3064425 its big because everybody on the team sees how important chemistry and when the chemistry is good like it is now you have to build on it and get the team 100 behind us
3064426 we had a great racecar our day was just uneventful to start 25th here and get a top five finish is a credit to juan pablo montoya and the entire big red team we had a fast enough car to win the race its just a little frustrating that we came up a bit short i love road racing and we have worked really hard to get this team better at it the guys did a great job building this car and put us in position to win a race
3064427 we were about a 10th place car we could have been 15th or we could have been fifth it was a great race for us we hardly made any adjustments we had to make sure we had enough fuel after last week im happy for this team to get a top 10 finish that was a good day for us right now
3064428 we were ok we probably were as fast as the guys who ran between fourth and seventh today watkins glen is just one of those tracks where its tough to get track position and when you start back in the field like we did it makes it a tougher mountain to climb overall the car wasnt too bad and we have some positive momentum heading into michigan next week
3064429 we had a good car it was a little bit loose all day thats the best i could do today the hardest part is having people dive bombing you if you battle hard with them you take a chance on losing a lot of points i had that in the back of my mind all day the pit calls were great for fuel mileage things worked out for us we kept it on the track and we got a top 15 finish
3064430 it was a decent day for our best buy dodge charger our car was just a little too free to be fast we tried to play the fuel mileage game and it just didnt work out for us to grab a top 15 is a solid day for us here at watkins glen
3064431 we started way back because of not having qualifying i think if we had started in the top 10 we could have finished in the top 10 starting back there we just didnt have opportunities to get track position other than that it was a good day for us elliott sadler kept it on the track and it was a good points day
3064432 im pretty happy considering i got pretty sick last night and had to go to the hospital it was a pretty tough day focusing i made a few mistakes here and there after the spin i restarted at the back and had to come back at the end i was taking it easy im happy another top 20 well be a little closer to the top 35 it was just a tough day for me to focus
3064433 its tough getting into someone elses car its a little uncomfortable without any real practice you just dont drive it like you drive your own car at least i didnt i was about half the boris today i just drove a conservative race and brought them home a consistent finish with some points if it were my car i would have definitely been more aggressive overall it was a fun day not a mark on the car i was hoping for a top 10 or top 15 finish so i would get an autographed richard petty hat but maybe since there are no marks on the car he still might give me one i hope so yesterday in the nationwide race i did nothing but make mistakes today i was better and more conservative
3064434 our day started out really well i thought that we were going to have a real promising day i just couldnt keep the handle on the car throughout the day and thats something that we have to work on at road courses the mobil 1 dodge started out good the guys did a great job in the pits all day i thought we were competitive and better then a 32nd place finish represents
3064435 thats a really fast corner coming to the front straightaway and for these cars theres not a lot of room for error if you get out there and hit something somebody is bound to collect you quite a few cars got collected in it we were fortunate that we were able to get our dodge home
3064436 sometimes the slower corners can produce the biggest wrecks because people are giving each other a lot less room i saw a car in the camping world west do a front flip out in sonoma so anything can happen just because youre going slow doesnt mean that it will be any less spectacular
3064437 we got it right in the driver side door so that wasnt the best place to be hit
3064438 i may be a little bit sore tomorrow the wreck kind of spun me in the car a little bit it wasnt a huge hit but you dont like any hits
3064439 my only experience at this track prior to this weekend was in nascar video games
3064440 aric did a heckuva job today considering this was his first race here driving at a road course is not what he grew up on its all about experience and he showed all of us on this team that he has the potential hes our future
3064441 my goal was to stay on the pavement finish the race and gain more experience in road course racing
3064442 i felt i did some good things out there today and some not so good things overall i was thrilled to be in the army chevy and competing with the big dogs i think of our soldiers in a time like this well never quit well continue the fight and work even harder to complete the mission
3064443 you would think racing teammates might be a little easier
3064444 but actually it turns out to be more mentally tough we know that that team works well and very close with ace capps crew chief ed mcculloch so we know that their setup is very close to ours
3064445 more than that were fighting to help our teammates gary scelzi jack beckman and jerry toliver get into the top 10 not that were super solid in the top 10 but were solidly in the top 10 we want nothing more than to get those guys in there
3064446 approaching that round we had lane choice and we just got outran
3064447 all in all a great day i talked with michael waltrip this morning told him congratulations on another year with napa were real excited about that and i wished him good luck in watkins glen today and he wished me good luck and told me not to lose to a girl
3064448 so we had to beat ashley force the first round or i would have to had to answer to michael waltrip i didnt want to have to call him back and say we lost to a girl this was all said in fun of course ashley force is an outstanding and tough competitor
3064449 we struggled to qualify here and we went from being no 16 to knock off the top qualifier first round then we ran really well the second round and just got beat so it wasnt all bad
3064450 its time to get ready now for the draw charity softball game thursday night in reading because we had another practice with gary scelzis superchargers here in brainerd and i am very sore i can tell you my teammates are as well but its going to be a lot of fun and were looking forward to the next two races before the countdown starts
3064451 i think how my team performed when our back was against the wall in that first round was tremendous
3064452 i mean we were under pressure that first round and it was a huge huge win for our team and for our chances of getting into the championship run
3064453 my perspective on this whole sport is pretty simple chris cunningham crew chief and i talk about what we want the car to run and what we think its going to take to win the round and you can be one of three places
3064454 you can either under power the track overpower the track or you can be perfect and that second run we were closer to perfect than under or over but then you run somebody like wilkerson and hes got his spot in the points locked down and has nothing to lose with the test ban on he can go out there and if he smokes the tires he knew he was too aggressive and if he makes a perfect run like he did he can learn some stuff from that
3064455 at the end of the day were still alive for this run to get into the top 10
3064456 this 79 points is not an insurmountable points deficit were certainly capable of winning weve proved that in multiple rounds we just havent gone on a run on sunday it felt real real good to get into that second round today and run off that big win against del reading is an important race and well go into there with the same attitude and confidence that this team is building on and try and get a couple more round wins before we get out of indy
3064457 its unfortunate that todd got ill but we did get expert help from rockstar energy drink dodge crew chief phil shuler and the armys alan johnson but it wasnt to be today
3064458 its been a tough season for the mopar oakley dodge team and when you put yourself in a position to having only three races to get into the countdown it makes it tough to get there
3064459 it is too bad because this car is a lot better than this although we havent shown it its very disappointing
3064460 all we can do is hope to win the next two races to try to squeak into the top 10 if not well just be a headache to the others in the countdown to 1 playoffs rounds
3064461 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram
3064462 they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men
3064463 i saw them slaughter a nine year old boy like a sheep because his family didnt pledge allegiance to them
3064464 very heavy handed killing of civilians backfired on them the sunnis just wouldnt stand for it any more
3064465 the guard thought something weird was going on and noted the time when he saw a photo of maddie next day he was sure it was her and called the police
3064466 i felt he really was so committed to that character the guy that was playing that guy that as an audience you bought his sincerity very few people i think could pull that off
3064467 robert was black the whole time my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle
3064468 to me the most important thing was alpa chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what hes doing is crazy the whole time
3064469 otherwise its just demeaning to brandons character and if its demeaning to an actual black man in the movie i would have run for the hills
3064470 if were all gonna play ball lets all play ball
3064471 i believe in fairness if we can punch you punch back and funny is funny
3064472 this sort of self important self involved thing seemed funny to me
3064473 i just couldnt figure a way to make that into a movie
3064474 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3064475 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3064476 you go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think youre doing of what you think is the right idea
3064477 if people are accepting it the way that you intended and you feel that from a general audience then stand behind it
3064478 i just hope at this point with whatever little weve done to brand ourselves as entertainers that you give us a little slack
3064479 its called a receptor because it interacts with a hormone in this case a hormone called gm csf
3064480 and when that happens it can cause uncontrolled growth and thats what cancer is about
3064481 at the moment many leukaemias are treated with chemotherapy that destroys the diseased blood cells and bone marrow as well as normal cells
3064482 we hope that this discovery will lead to targeted therapies more specific to the malfunctioning cells seen in diseases such as leukaemia
3064483 i think thats a real positive of this work it could target those diseases that are just untreatable at the moment or very difficult to treat
3064484 our northern tool equipment ford was fast all night we struggled in practice yesterday im not going to lie we worked our butts off we changed everything on this truck to end up 25th on the speed chart my hat is off to all these guys matt puccia and everybody on this crew for helping out this weekend we had a really good truck we had a flat tire halfway through and that kind of got us behind so we were kind of put in a box and had to really work to get track position we didnt take any tires at the end we were a little bit too tight because we didnt get an adjustment on it its frustrating to lose one three laps from the end it seems like me and johnny have had a lot of close battles this year it was a good run for us
3064485 we were fast and i felt confident in the beginning that this was going to be a good day
3064486 i never got a pit road speeding penalty in my life and today i was nailed twice for speeding unbelievable
3064487 we had a fast car and looked like we were going to have great track position at the end the fuel strategy was working but that second speeding penalty killed us
3064488 after that second speeding penalty we still had a chance for a decent finish
3064489 but at the end i went for it and tried to pass max papis i couldnt quite get by him he came down on me and then i wheel hopped went through the gravel and wrecked
3064490 two speeding penalties and wrecking at the end equals a very frustrating day
3064491 i was reasonably consistent until the second round but on that last run i just basically guessed at the tree ive just got to get it figured out because ive got a bad ass motorcycle its frustrating because i have a bike thats capable of winning
3064492 this is such a competitive class that you see a lot of red lights on eliminations day every inch and every thousandth of a second counts for so much that many times we take risks at the starting lights sometimes it works for you sometimes it doesnt there were five red lights today
3064493 im just proud of the effort my team put in tonight and actually all year long
3064494 obviously you want the money but we really wanted the bonus points because the big money comes in the championship series
3064495 i know he was driving like crazy to catch me but i was driving like a mad man to stay ahead of him
3064496 hes always good at south boston but we were a little better tonight
3064497 we made a fuel run in practice and we knew we werent going to stop for fuel tonight this team is spot on right now
3064498 his car didnt budge off the corners all night he could run straight up off the corners which really made it tough to get by him
3064499 he had a great car tonight and theyre tough every week if thats not bad enough hes seems to be able to run 500 laps on a tank of fuel
3064500 to finish third in our third race back is awesome
3064501 johnny rumley always ran well here in this car youve got to give mark huff motorsports credit they get around this place pretty good
3064502 im just glad to be back i love racing but i hate running bad it feels good to be competitive again
3064503 i went to take a little bump stage deeper because it was the final round and lane choice isnt a big deal because there is no next round
3064504 my brain told my right foot to go and the light hadnt come on yet absolutely 100 percent a drivers mistake
3064505 the valvoline mts dodge guys gave us a car that could win this race today we ran great all four rounds it was a great weekend points wise we couldnt have asked for much more it could have been an outstanding weekend if id been effective in the final
3064506 im really disappointed but weve got a race in a week im going to get over it the valvoline mts dodge guys are over it already everybody is excited that our car is predictable and repeatable now
3064507 it doesnt matter where you are in the points until after richmond really we didnt really run that great we had a real average car and we had a real above average strategy and pit crew so those guys got me the good finish really
3064508 anytime you can finish in the top five in this series youre doing your job and certainly itll help us in the future but well take it into michigan next week and work on the car and get it where we need it and take it from there
3064509 actually everything went really well marcos has done one heck of a job for his first time here in a cup car and all that we needed this so badly because i think this is our first top five you tell me i dont know but its been a long time hyder came on board with his people its just made a world of difference we ran well last week at pocono we had a good car at sonoma also but this car was really good today mike smith and dave simba took it to atlanta last week and tested it and all that stuff worked well and blended right in what hyder and hoyt overbagh were doing and it all fell into place sometimes things will fall into place for you
3064510 anytime you have a good run it creates enthusiasm and all that and were taking the pocono car that ran pretty well at pocono were taking it to michigan next week were re doing all of our race cars right now weve got about two of them ready and thats one of them
3064511 it felt like i passed everyone three times some guys just through the cycle of pit stops i did pass three or four times out there we passed quite a few on the track we passed quite a few in the pits too just with our strategy i wasnt overtaken all day which im proud of and we did a lot of passing you have to have the right strategy when you come from the back its not all about passing cars out there its about having the right calls in the pits too and david hyder did a great job stopping us at the right time so i could make it home on the gas and its just been a great day its been a great two days on strategy to be honest with you because we managed really well yesterday as well
3064512 ive got a three year old and a one year old back at home so if i have to big a night its going to be really painful on monday so ill have a couple of cans everyone was asking me what cans were last night beer cans by the way not soda beer cans but just really excited its a great weekend im going to enjoy it when i get back to charlotte ive dragged my family a long way away from immediate friends and family down home and its just a lot of commitment when you have a weekend like this it just validates the choices that ive made to come across here and have a go at it its a big bad world out here in nascar world and im just pleased that im able to have a weekend like this to remember when its all said and done ill be able to home back to tasmania and tell them how good i was at watkins glen on one year
3064513 you know ive got two little girls at home and im going to wake up tomorrow morning have a great day with them and just enjoy it ill celebrate it with my crew when we get back to charlotte and ill celebrate with my family but weve got a race next week ive gone down this road before and races come and go and youve got to try and stay level you dont want to get too high when the goings good and you dont want to get too low when the goings bad so well enjoy it ill speak to my dad here in a minute back in australia hes waiting for a phone call so i can tell him all about it but just really excited that we finished the deal i really just wanted to finish today especially there the last 15 laps there i didnt want to ruin the day by making mistakes i just wanted to finish and weve done that all my guys on the wood brothers side should be proud and its just going to be great to enjoy it tonight
3064514 i was pretty happy with it it was fairly uneventful from our side
3064515 we didnt have any big dramas the red there at the end kind of killed us a little bit but im really happy with the day proud of kyle and how he ran and we saw behind us that denny hamlin who finished eighth was having a good day too so im really proud of the whole jgr organization and thought it was a good day for us
3064516 but even if we got that fixed im not sure we were going to be fast enough to get by kyle
3064517 he never made a mistake he had a really really good car today and he was fast in all the right spots he needed to be fast in you know i think he ran a perfect race today i thought we were really close i mean were talking nitpicking stuff to get our car perfect so i was really proud of our guys our pit stops were good today i thought zippy crew chief greg zipadelli had good pit strategy its days like today that you want every week you want it to be uneventful and be this smooth every day
3064518 the day went as planned lets have the right people go out so we can start moving up in the points
3064519 everyone was talking about clinching a spot in the countdown before indy but that still doesnt deny the fact that i still want to win drag races and make a statement and catch up to my teammate who is no 1 in the standings thats really what we were looking at just moving up in the points
3064520 and we did that today and we made some ground up in some areas that u s army car was bad all weekend long thats all there is to it crew chief mike green and assistant crew chief neal strausbaugh and all the
3064521 it was a great day for dsr all the way around
3064522 to have both top fuel cars in the final makes me very proud to be a part of this organization and i want to thank fram prestone autolite and bendix everything is working just the way its supposed to and if i cant win my teammate should
3064523 we used the car up a lot and at the end we had no clutch left no brakes left and it was tiring
3064524 coming through the field is really hard work we really worked the car hard to get through the field in the first half of the race
3064525 it was great fun running with those guys at the front ive really got to thank them for not taking me off there it would be easy to send me off into the weeds with that rookie stripe on the car
3064526 the wood brothers have given me a great car on both the road courses and ive really got to thank them its great to run well for them
3064527 ive got to thank little debbie and the mckee family and everyone involved here weve had a good run here and ill remember this weekend for a long time
3064528 its just a great weekend all around i thought yesterday was great but when i wound up there on that red flag i realised where i was i was behind tony and in front of all those other great drivers
3064529 we came up out of the truck so well yesterday in practice we were too scared to change anything and the car was flopping around a lot during the race
3064530 im just so proud of the wood brothers for giving me a piece that i could get out there and give it my best and little debbie and the mckee family for giving me the chance to go cup racing
3064531 i dont want to be labelled a road racer by the way too i am 10th in the nationwide series points so im trying to make it as a
3064532 i just really want to be respectful to the guys out there who are doing it week in and week out
3064533 its actually quite strange because the guys that i had at sonoma arent the same crew chief and hoyt wasnt with us when we were at sonoma when we ran really well too
3064534 well i felt bad for breaking the gearbox at sonoma because i think we were going on for a strong top 10 there for them but theyve had a tough run theres no doubt about that and i hope i can play my part in helping them get back on track the problem is bigger than one person
3064535 ive got a three year old and a one year old back at home so if i have too big a night its going to be really painful on monday so ill have a couple of cans everyone was asking me what cans were last night beer cans by the way not soda beer cans
3064536 its a big bad world out here in nascar world and im just pleased that im able to have a weekend like this to remember when its all said and done ill be able to home back to tasmania and tell them how good i was at watkins glen on one year
3064537 you know ive got two little girls at home and im going to wake up tomorrow morning have a great day with them and just enjoy it
3064538 so well enjoy it ill speak to my dad here in a minute back in australia hes waiting for a phone call so i can tell him all about it but just really excited that we finished the deal i really just wanted to finish today especially there the last 15 laps there i didnt want to ruin the day by making mistakes i just wanted to finish and weve done that all my guys on the wood brothers side should be proud and its just going to be great to enjoy it tonight
3064539 anytime you can finish in the top five in this series youre doing your job and certainly itll help us in the future but well take it into michigan next week and work on the car and get it where we need it and take it from there
3064540 actually everything went really well marcos has done one heck of a job for his first time here in a cup car and all that we needed this so badly because i think this is our first top five you tell me i dont know but its been a long time
3064541 hyder came on board with his people its just made a world of difference we ran well last week at pocono we had a good car at sonoma also but this car was really good today mike smith and dave simba took it to atlanta last week and tested it and all that stuff worked well and blended right in what hyder and hoyt overbagh were doing and it all fell into place sometimes things will fall into place for you
3064542 anytime you have a good run it creates enthusiasm and all that and were taking the pocono car that ran pretty well at pocono were taking it to michigan next week were re doing all of our race cars right now weve got about two of them ready and thats one of them
3064543 theres been two times now where ive driven by in n out burger chain and im like pull the damn car over i need a triple triple burger dude
3064544 as compensar amos su abultada experiencia en el rea como empleado en una compa ia de software y due o de una imprenta por lo menos era hijo un tal popeye
3064545 they were fooled into believing they were coming to work in the greenhouses or to pick strawberries
3064546 the girls were told that the ring would go after their families in russia and also put the false notion in their heads that the spanish police had been bought off and would laugh if they filed a complaint
3064547 its about finding clarity when parts of the project can go a little askew for instance we did a lot of work on our chat windows but we did too much work on them and we started losing focus and my job is to bring clarity back to it same thing happened with careers we went down a terrible path where we had too many careers we have 250 odd at one point and we boiled it right back down to 20
3064548 we are so proud of terry and are going to miss him terribly
3064549 he was true to his art and respected by all the industry he was the actors actor
3064550 i used to go round to his house in hanover terrace i had that irritating habit of just turning up which i suppose is a working class thing
3064551 he will be sorely missed there are not so many like him any more
3064552 you guys you should be ashamed of yourself shouting slogans for what here better go back home
3064553 you guys dont have any sense of shame shouting these anti india slogans from the foreign soil better go back to india and take up your fight for khalistan there
3064554 i firmly believe theres no sense shouting slogans here i have met them several times and i have always told them if you want khalistan go back to india and shout slogans there why are you making these kinds of demands living in another country its insulting for india its insulting for the sikh community if you have any problem it is with the government of india and not with the canadian government canada has such good friendly relations with india
3064555 sikhs are now known all over the world thanks to the fact that dr singh the first sikh ever in the history of independent india is the prime minister of the country
3064556 these people demonstrators forget that 25 per cent of the indian army comprises of sikhs and sikhs protect the borders between india and pakistan where sikhs also live
3064557 why do these people want to live in a small well than to be part of the ocean so that they could prosper
3064558 problems are the same as in 1984 they have done nothing against the people behind the killing of thousands of sikhs during that period
3064559 a puppet of the congress party and that they are keeping peace in punjab with the help of the guns

3064603 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3064604 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3064605 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3064606 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3064607 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3064663 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year
3064664 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
3064665 we started really well and finished really well last season if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season

3064871 but the objection to this argument is that the person who moves from protestantism to catholicism does the very same thing essentially creates church in his own image by reading the bible and deciding that the doctrine of the catholic church most closely matches what the bible teaches so the objection is a form of the tu quoque i e you too objection
3064872 but there is a very important difference what is problematic in the protestant approach is not that the individual uses his own intellect and will in making decisions about the identity and nature of the church we cant but use our own intellect and will in making decisions individualism is not equivalent to individual agency so thats not the issue
3064873 the issue is the criterion by which we decide what is the true church the approach in the protestant case because in protestantism apostolic succession insofar as the term is used is thought to refer fundamentally to the doctrine of the apostles is to interpret scripture while typically assuming sola scriptura and work out what one thinks was the apostles doctrine and then find a present day community of persons who shares that doctrine call them the church and then join the church
3064874 so what exactly is the relevant difference between the protestant picking out a protestant denomination that fits his own interpretation of scripture and the protestant adult who becomes catholic for the right reason in the former case the individual works out a set of doctrines from scripture and then seeks out those persons who are presently teaching according to that set of doctrines and joins their community and submits to them in the latter case by contrast the individual finds in history those whom the apostles appointed and authorized observes what they say about the basis of the transmission of magisterial authority and then traces that line of successive authorizations down through history to the present day to a living magisterium and then submits to what this present day magisterium is teaching in both cases the individual inquirer is using his intellect and will but in the former case he is using his own determination of doctrine from his interpretation of scripture to define and locate the church but in the latter case he is using the succession of sacramental authority from the apostles to locate the church and then let the church tell him what is and is not orthodox doctrine
3064875 great works of art catching in a miracle of talent features poses costumes atmosphere and character
3064876 the people are real they breathe and exist solidly on earth
3064877 the stages were studying from life wrenching truth from experience squaring enlarging transporting onto canvas going back if necessary to the model for this or that detail
3064878 asking the count de pastoret for his gloves or going back to madame moitessiers left arm drawing it life size so as to transpose it directly onto canvas going back to it again and again this is when ingres got bogged down it was an over elaborate almost obsessive proceeding the aim of which was to get nearer to the truth of the matter
3064879 of all the masters ive studied i have most enjoyed the work of ingres
3064880 ingres preferred materials were the sharply pointed graphite pencil and smooth white paper he believed color to be no more than an accessory to drawing to him drawing was not just the line it was the expression the inner form the composition and the modeling
3064881 his marks seem loose and free but they are perfectly placed
3064882 prudhon completed some drawings where the core of the shadow runs like a stripe down the whole length of a pose exposing every nuance of muscle it is absolutely stunning
3064883 it was actually an attempt to ransack the available iconography and compositions so that he could amass a personal library of imagery for later use what the artist most valued in these drawings was not their personal calligraphy or quality of rendering but simply their design information
3064884 i was taken by kollwitzs early work and the depth of form she got from her copious linework
3064885 i also appreciated the emotional strength in her work she taught me that i could go much further than the surface form if i looked inside myself
3064886 the heart of picassos evolution as an artist and icon lies in his where his experimentation and visual breakthroughs were generated
3064887 it takes the detailed knowledge of a master draftsman to portray an object in its simplest form
3064888 not with a softened cont mark not with a cross hatched buildup for volume not in layered shades of graphite to model an area but a direct line conveying all form and space
3064889 the composition is based solely on the juxtaposition of space and line the interior and landscape depicted are flattened pushing every figure to the foreground the result is an overpowering assault accomplished with a bold unbroken line cut out shapes and a compressed picture plane
3064890 his drawings are virtuosic amazingly varied in technique and fabulously slyly inventive
3064891 local taxpayers will not be responsible for any of the security costs of the republican national convention coming to town
3064892 the grant represents federal dollars coming back to minnesota as minnesotans we will reap the long term benefits of a major investment in public safety readiness and infrastructure not only for the convention but for well into the future
3064893 the 50 million grant represents one more very big step in making sure we are ready for the convention
3064894 minnesota has a strong public safety community and partnerships that work well in all types of situations this grant ensures that these partnerships are backed by the resources to support and prepare officers for the convention
3064895 this is an enormous opportunity to showcase our state to the world and its important that we help provide our law enforcement officials the tools they need to keep minnesotans safe
3064896 with tens of thousands ready to descend upon the greater metro area for the 2008 republican national convention minnesotans will have the unique opportunity to showcase all that our great state has to offer
3064897 this significant influx of people and attention will present the greater metro area with a number of security concerns and this funding will help mitigate these challenges as a former mayor i know how important these federal dollars are to ensuring our state and local law enforcement agencies can work together seamlessly in securing this event

3064951 the general atmosphere in jamaica is a feeling of no tolerance towards homosexuals in general the respondents life is definitely at risk
3064952 in some moral matters the use of reason allows for a legitimate diversity in our prudential judgments
3064953 the morality of such questions lies not in what is done the moral object but in the motive and circumstances therefore because these prudential judgments do not involve a direct choice of something evil and take into consideration various goods it is possible for catholic voters to arrive at different even opposing judgments
3064954 a correct conscience recognizes that there are some choices that always involve doing evil and which can never be done even as a means to a good end
3064955 such acts are judged to be intrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life as well as marriage and family
3064956 in light of the above it is a correct judgment of conscience that we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
3064957 what are we do do though when there is no such alternative because we have a moral obligation to vote deciding not to vote at all is not ordinarily an acceptable solution to this dilemma
3064958 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity
3064959 we would not be acting immorally therefore if we were to vote for a candidate who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity

3065098 every time i read rolanders journal im more and more impressed by how entertaining it is without avoiding purely scientific descriptions he has a talent for telling stories and imbedding either entertaining stories amidst his scientific descriptions or vice versa
3065099 the accurate transcription and translation that have been done by the team led by james dobreff will certainly draw the attention of the public to the unknown side of rolander as a scientist
3065100 coordinating an effort to produce a volume of scientific commentary including over 40 illustrations based on rolanders herbarium
3065101 complete dedication to the pursuit of natural history a nearly fatal fever in amsterdam just prior to leaving for suriname had ruined his health yet he is out collecting specimens and describing objects six days a week he rests and reads the bible goes to church on sundays his critics claim that he was a drunk in suriname a claim for which there is no evidence in any form but none of these critics bothered to travel to copenhagen to read the diarium and its location was no secret
3065102 rolander in his diary proved he was a well prepared and skilled biologist his perspicacity and knowledge of the literature available at his time permitted him to recognize correctly several undescribed species in addition to the others he had also classified usually in agreement to the published works of pre linnaean authors linnaeus himself and contemporaries
3065103 explains in detail what amerindians and african slaves use plants for medicinal purposes there are also long sections of ritual celebrations by the slaves and passages describing their battles with european mercenaries
3065104 rather than satisfy himself with the quick publication of a catalogue of the plants and animals of suriname he spent nine years working on his diarium during those years i suspect that he struggled to create an artful balance between the scientific descriptions and the numerous background narrations and entertaining and disturbing digressions his efforts make his book an easy read that educates without fatiguing the reader
3065105 the diarium surinamicum is the best evidence that rolander did not fail to investigate nature in suriname in spite of what is said about him
3065106 his achievements viz the records descriptions and collections of many species in the relatively short period he stayed in suriname are testimony to the diligent and competent work he had done the fact that he had had a successful expedition is unquestionable in my point of view if the diary had been published during his lifetime i am quite sure that his reputation would be fairly different
3065107 now i believe rolanders dedication is finally going to come to fruition and bear its long maturing fruit
3065108 it is never too late to unearth hidden or forgotten information about anything
3065109 rolander will be a tremendous aid to biologists zoologists sociologists and related scientists working in the field in suriname rolander provides detailed descriptions of plants insects birds and people he usually includes descriptions of habitats and the weather is described in detail including the temperature for every day in suriname so our scientists will have a detailed description of numerous plants and animals including european slave owners african slaves amerindians and fugitive slaves and fugitive slave colonies to compare with what they encounter today
3065110 since it is a prime detailed narrative about the suriname of the 18th century discoursing on almost everything
3065111 those plant names species will become validly published but will be illegitimate names or superfluous names since they are synonyms of others that have been validly published before
3065112 rolanders precise registers of the environments he explored are among the first reported this kind of information is still interesting and important to be compared to the present since it could be used as a reference to seasonal climatic changes that most likely happened from that time 1755 56 additionally the description given by rolander of the pristine nature he found in suriname is also useful for understanding species distribution frequency abundant vs rare species in the context of what is found nowadays in fragmented and disturbed landscapes

3065212 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors

3065229 the fbis disclosure that its agents secretly sought and obtained the phone records of american newspaper reporters confirms once again that there are insufficient safeguards on the agencys use of national security letters and other intrusive surveillance tools there arent enough controls inside the agency and there arent enough checks from outside the agency especially dangerous is the fbis power to impose gag orders on those ordered to disclose information these gag orders which are often unnecessary and almost always overbroad invite abuse

3065258 spanje was heel effici nt in de cirkel en supergevaarlijk op de tegenaanval wij hebben ook kansen gecre erd maar konden er niet het maximum uit halen en tegen een topteam als spanje moet je die kansen afwerken de eerste 20 minuten waren minder goed maar de tijd van de zware nederlagen ligt nu echt wel achter ons de spelers hebben al meerdere keren bewezen dat ze een zware topwedstrijd kunnen spelen
3065259 we hadden verwacht dat spanje sterk uit de startblokken zou schieten en we hebben het moeten ondergaan maar we hebben het toch min of meer kunnen rechttrekken wij zijn een van de opkomende teams maar we hebben toch wel nog wat werk om de volle 70 minuten weerstand te bieden tegen een team als spanje
3065260 de ambities zijn door deze nederlaag niet veranderd we willen nog steeds een top 8 hier in peking en we willen onze wereldranking verbeteren natuurlijk is het een bonus als je een punt haalt tegen een topper maar het is na ef om te denken dat dat ook zomaar gaat

3065610 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3065611 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3065812 before using deadline managing our render farm was a real thorn in my side ive since become a total deadline evangelist and sing its praises to the heavens because it just works we never have to worry about what we push through the render farm i leave it running overnight and when i look at the logs in the morning id see that deadline was doing a massive amount of behind the scenes housekeeping deadline is simply brilliant
3065813 our growing list of customers and testimonials is proof that deadline is addressing the needs of vfx studios regardless of size were constantly hearing about deadlines reliability ease of integration and use and how it gives facilities peace of mind because deadline enables them to get the job done on time
3065814 he is a person who is exactly the same age as i am and he was full of life
3065815 he is a guy who inspires us and makes us laugh and the next thing you know he is gone so it was very sad for me
3065816 a style of his own and represented a kind of an attitude which came from the streets of america
3065817 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was underexploited in america but had great potential
3065818 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3065819 i remember when comedians in advance of his performance were booed off and the first thing that came out of his mouth as soon as he looked at the audience was im not scared of you mother s
3065820 he coined that phrase then and it became one of his top calling cards for his whole life

3065829 it is scientific dogma to state that health claims should be based primarily on well designed human intervention studies
3065830 much of what is already known about human health cannot be validated using gold standard clinical trials these studies are of course important but they provide only one source of information all sources of scientific data have inherent limitations hence the need to focus on the totality of the available data and weighing of the evidence
3065831 medicine based aimed at deciding whether a drug can prevent cure or alleviate a disease or medical condition in the treatment of well defined groups of people at high risk of disease or already with a disease

3065864 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3065865 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia

3065867 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone

3065869 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3065870 a grownup decided that this was the way it was going to be since he was the dictator a of the country everyone did what he said

3065996 the subject really began to intrigue me when a person i recently met confided in me that a relationship he was involved with for six years was little more than a bad habit an empty shell of what was once a great relationship

3066034 someone smashed one of the alarm call points after a big night out we know exactly who it was and the guest has been charged 1500 for the call out fee and to fix the call point
3066035 it was a fairly big stuff up by the guest and when she was asked why she did it she said she had no idea and she was upset and disappointed with herself she left next day

3066050 stress travel and exhaustion can have a dramatic effect on peoples faces even after a few weeks
3066051 it gives her a hungover look even if she hasnt been drinking unfortunately it has a greater effect because shes 39 and not 25

3066057 this is the toughest decision any prosecutor has to make
3066058 he atwater had been seen with that weapon prior to this crime
3066059 we do need kind of infrastructure right away to address things like youth crime and senior quality of life
3066060 i really think the inner city areas like east nashville is being developed and being improved at the expense of outer communities
3066061 a lot of community members have expressed concern about the fact there is no place for youth and seniors to go
3066062 we were knee deep in the ocean when we noticed the stingray

3066069 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in jammu and kashmir which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people we call for immediate steps to end the violence against innocent kashmiris
3066070 important that an enabling environment free of violence is created to sustain the peace process and address the long standing dispute of jammu and kashmir
3066071 reportedly the movement of trucks to and from the kashmir valley is being blocked this has serious humanitarian implications

3066081 a lot of them find that a set schedule works well for them they know when they gotta do things each day and they get em done
3066082 our league is well balanced i think each school is really positive and thinks it has a chance to win which is good
3066083 well you are qualified to take tickets but we think youd do better dressed in nothing shaking it on the volleyball courts do it for god mao and country not in that order
3066084 its not because he is black i dont like him its because he is muslim

3066086 we can rejoice too when we run into problems and trials for we know that they are good for us they help us learn to endure and endurance develops strength of character in us and character strengthens our confident expectation of salvation and this expectation will not disappoint us for we know how dearly god love us because he has given us the holy spirit to fill our hearts with his love
3066087 you have brains in your head you have feet in your shoes you can steer yourself any direction you choose

3066095 my wicked enemy unfolds at a steady pace and offers up a host of characters that keep the deadly action flowing the storyline is fresh the characters are entertaining and the romance is delightfully steamy
3066096 i think ultimately we shouldnt worry too much about what ideas
3066097 out of 1 3 million copies sold barnes and noble has had fifteen copies returned ooh such a backlash
3066098 another thing i didnt like was how meyer shoved her religion down everyone throat in this book namely waiting until marriage to have sex and that sex is had to only have children
3066099 kevin emersons teenaged vampire oliver nocturne is at that stage where most vampires are bonded to their demons allowing them to access the forces of the other worlds
3066100 with the dark days series ive tried to create a very open ended world with a rich tapestry of characters
3066101 this is the fourth installment in the anna strong vampire chronicles and is as riveting as the rest
3066102 vampire selene kate beckinsale is a pvc clad killing machine
3066103 affinity is at once a gothic mystery a romance and a quasi supernatural tale with plenty of moody atmospherics to go with it
3066104 for all the rutting and violent exsanguination at the heart of true blood is an oddly sweet love story for a 175 year old ambulatory corpse vampire bill is an awfully courtly gent
3066105 oh god dont take a half step on your dismount the judgesll crucify you
3066106 kill you no at least not yet right now i have no plans to kill you but dont be relieved
3066107 are are you going are you going to r r
3066108 that isnt part of the plan im not a monster
3066109 im just doing my job im paid very well to get results but right now were not getting them
3066110 the state legislature should not try to help close its budget gap by denying the right of purchase to the seneca nation and its licensed retailers or by jeopardizing the jobs and livelihoods of more than 1 000 seneca and non seneca families involved in our retail economy
3066111 we understand the demands of state legislators seeking re election this year
3066112 but we would note that the strong majority of western new york voters and consumers elsewhere as well have supported the nations right to commerce and right to sell tax immune products while they enjoy their own freedom to shop where they choose
3066113 much too fun to waste on just one set of game rules
3066114 our analysis of the potential market for thyrotest indicates that it is much larger than the current estimated instance of hypothyroidism in the u s
3066115 the wide range of symptoms most of them very common in todays society opens what we view to be a significant opportunity for a screening device like thyrotest that is clia waived and therefore allowed to be used in a wide variety of testing venues we also believe that thyrotest is significantly superior to competitive products and our marketing strategy for the product will include providing data that supports this contention
3066116 she is much better compared to when she was in the hospital but she is not 100 per cent stable
3066117 sometimes she cries when she meets or talks with someone close to her especially to her family or to the consulate
3066118 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3066119 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3066120 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3066121 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3066122 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3066123 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3066124 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
3066125 hopefully we can have a repeat of the success we had last year
3066126 we are putting out an apb for all musicians to help get us through the night
3066127 our goal is to get the commercial district of lansing booming again in the past lansing was bit of a boom town with the introduction of the railroad and we would like to see that again
3066128 we found that one of the most important factors of post operative quality of life and satisfaction was post operative asymmetry or the aesthetic outcome that women experienced after their surgery
3066129 its important for women to think about all of those issues at the time that theyre making their surgical decision and realize that although breast conserving surgery may or may not be less disfiguring than mastectomy theyre likely to experience some asymmetry afterwards that may impact their quality of life
3066130 its important for breast surgeons to have an open and honest dialogue with their patients so that they understand patients expectations before surgery and can better address post operative recovery needs
3066131 people with early alzheimers disease who were less physically fit had four times more brain shrinkage when compared to normal older adults than those who were more physically fit suggesting less brain shrinkage related to the alzheimers disease process in those with higher fitness levels
3066132 people with early alzheimers disease may be able to preserve their brain function for a longer period of time by exercising regularly and potentially reducing the amount of brain volume lost evidence shows decreasing brain volume is tied to poorer cognitive performance so preserving more brain volume may translate into better cognitive performance
3066133 this is one of the first studies to explore the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and alzheimers disease
3066134 at present screening by breast self examination or physical examination by a trained health worker cannot be recommended
3066135 seek medical advice if they detect any change in their breasts that might be breast cancer
3066136 we suggest that the lack of supporting evidence should be discussed with these women to enable them to make an informed decision
3066137 i think what we are seeing is that women are familiar with their breast through breast self exam and when there is a lump they notice the difference
3066138 i have an incredible amount of vintage that ive collected over the years
3066139 my style is very americana i gravitate to pieces that are american by nature either western or depression era
3066140 i do almost everything in jeans except sleep denim has become so high priced as of late my friends back home dont want to spend 250 for a pair of jeans i want them to be able to walk into a medium priced store and be able to afford a cool pair of jeans for less than 100 bucks dollars
3066141 they make the decision who makes the team and who sits on the bench we hope they exercise that power to get this problem stopped
3066142 this is so much larger a problem than the general public is aware of
3066143 our first objective is raising awareness about how big of a problem it really is and not just continuing to deny that it is not going on in my school or district second is to educate parents coaches and teachers about how dangerous this drug really is
3066144 it is not typical of what we usually run into with the coaching community nationally
3066145 the kids sometimes dont like to hear it because its hard work to do it the right way and coaches are sometimes hesitant to deal with the steroid problem because that might be their starting quarterback or whatever hopefully we left them with the message that it can be a life or death issue
3066146 you are beautiful when you let friends have their space when you believe when you laugh or are moved to tears when you let it just roll right off your back when you talk about your dreams when you help a turtle across the road when you try to do the right thing even when it comes out wrong when you love
3066147 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations israel is a sovereign country
3066148 we are in very close contact with the israelis and we talk about the diplomatic track that were on
3066149 theyve said that diplomacy can work here and i know theyre doing their part to talk to all of the countries with which they have good relations to explain why its important to have a tough edge to our diplomacy
3066150 were on a diplomatic course and thats the important thing
3066151 i dont know what the iranians would do without the revenue that they receive from selling oil and so the idea that they would somehow deprive the world of iranian oil exports would have to have a pretty devastating effect on iran itself
3066152 can military strikes destroy irans gas centrifuge program probably not
3066153 this analogy is grossly misleading it neglects the important differences between a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program and a reactor based program and fails to account for the dispersed relatively advanced and hardened nature of irans gas centrifuge facilities
3066154 it also ignores the years iran has had to acquire centrifuge items abroad often illicitly allowing it to create reserve stocks of critical equipment and raw materials

3066196 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3066197 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers

3066274 it is important to tell womens stories in order to give wholeness to our lives in the same way that the predominance of white stories made it seem that black people did not exist so too the majority of male stories that are represented can make it seem like womens stories dont exist
3066275 as a women who owns her voice who possesses pleats and folds that are exposed in the telling of her own story you seem to be saying that the fear of being made public can be debilitating
3066276 this second book helps us navigate how you make sense of the world and this country what does it mean to break through fear and give it expression in a way that doesnt stop you from going public
3066277 id been reflecting on my life and thought about dying without having written what i needed to write would i come back as a ghost bothering my relatives i love my family i dont want them disturbed by my untold stories from the grave i need to tell my stories
3066278 theyd think that black women didnt exist the fear of dying without having written flipped an important switch in me i knew i didnt care about the fear of going public any more
3066279 jars for those who are trying to claim their own agency but also wanting a sacred space i see a link between those poems and couldnt shake the feeling that these two works talk to each other
3066280 now that youre out there you cant eat your cake and have it still said one to me ive had to find a way to define the line between private and public
3066281 i like the way you speak about the relationship between public violation and the importance of women claiming our desire sexually politically and psychically
3066282 in my work as a womens activist ive observed how the movement has attempted to claim ownership over womens bodies but its vital that women do this for themselves we cant hide our sexuality it wants to emerge one thing i realised in the wake of publishing these hands was that everything that has happened me to me in private has happened to somebody else out there in the public suddenly people were writing to me telling me that i had told their story that helped me realise that every private thing is actually public and there is nothing that has not been written about what is unique is the way its expressed again that made it safe for me to write about loving women its really not that unique
3066283 these poems both contain a moment of defeat highlighting the kind of women were told to disown they are modern day david and goliath tales except that goliath seems to be winning youve chosen to tell the tale of a difficult foremother in noni jabavu are these poems part of the same project
3066284 it was too difficult to live your dreams in those days
3066285 now boys with good voices like my father once was get scholarships to study at such schools then it was impossible to live your dreams impossible even to dream
3066286 do you feel you have a sense of community as a creative person in this city
3066287 whatever were looking for we find it here eventually no matter how long it takes i love meeting a writer in a shopping mall and talking about words more and more black women are forging a sense of community defining it i feel this its palpable
3066288 one possibility is that coming into democracy has opened up a space where women can choose to write in my previous political life writing felt like a luxury in active politics it felt like an indulgence the other possibility is related to the shifting intensity of fear it may be that the broad political space we operate in now allow for the idea of daring now you can do what you like to do

3066359 how feasible is it that the majority of u s food consumption be shifted to a local mode how long would it take and would it necessarily be a good thing
3066360 our research tells us consumers have about five or six reasons for wanting local freshness and taste keeping farmland in the community and having open spaces a desire to be close to the food source and know where it comes from support of local farmers and keeping money in the community embedded in all of this is concern about food safety all this creates pretty powerful interest
3066361 the highest form of luxury is now growing it yourself or paying other people to grow it for you this has become fashion
3066362 a lot of expensive imported food with little thought about where it came from

3066366 i do not think that any people should discuss the stand taken by the french government to protect its democratic institutions and its way of life
3066367 translates is not the continuity of human nature the taste for innovation and ornament the desire to stand out group rivalry and so on but a historical discontinuity a major break however circumscribed with the form of socialization that had prevailed from time immemorial the immutable logic of tradition on the scale of the human adventure the sudden appearance of fashion signaled a departure from the form of collective cohesiveness that had ensured the durability of custom it signified the deployment of a new social bond and of a new social temporality
3066368 whatever the disagreements of feminism with white male domination within western societies outside their borders feminism turned from being the critic of the system of white male dominance to being its docile servant

3066374 he stood for all of the right things and he lived them its just hard to imagine a nicer person that this tragic and senseless act has happened to

3066376 huge groundswell of support to help us pick up the pieces
3066377 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3066378 the long list of people who have offered their assistance kind words and prayers to us has been incredible

3066383 he is a guy who inspires us and makes us laugh and the next thing you know he is gone
3066384 i remember when comedians in advance of his performance were booed off and the first thing that came out of his mouth as soon as he looked at the audience was im not scared of you motheruckers
3066385 he coined that phrase then and it became one of his top calling cards for his whole life

3066389 the ministry of justice has recognized the importance of cardinal newman as a national figure and as a figure of great importance to the country the church and to ecumenism
3066390 the bishop stands by exactly what he said in a recent statement the church is closing and we have nothing further to add
3066391 keen to be able to use all saints on an early time scale under the sharing agreement
3066392 we are also following this up with the vatican because judging from the letter we received from them which voiced concern about the sharing arrangement they do not seem very happy about the bishops plans
3066393 people have donated to the church believing the money was for the upkeep of the building and to pay for the priest it was donated in good faith
3066394 to find money has been withheld from their church but is suddenly available to be spent on another church will upset a lot of people
3066395 we thought we were talking to the diocese about the future of ss peter and pauls but it seems that at the same time they have been in secret negotiations over all saints
3066396 you would expect someone sharing a building to make a contribution towards it
3066397 if you are going to make changes to a church its going to cost money attending to decoration costs a lot of money
3066398 very sad for anyone to lose their place of worship
3066399 when thats decided we can look at the number of parishes needed
3066400 the laity are going to have to be more proactive
3066401 even with 1 500 priests in ireland currently there are 4 402 including secular priests and members of religious congregations we would still have one priest for every 3 000 or more people compare that with the priest i met recently in rural timor leste who has a parish of 30 000
3066402 personnel is not a major issue in the irish catholic church but morale is as is a sense of isolation lack of appreciation and low income
3066403 what is the right thing to do then find the way to do it
3066404 a priest of dublin name and address with the editor
3066405 if one wanted to devise a scheme to offend belittle and sow the seeds of dissension among the clergy it would be difficult to come up with anything better than his grace of dublin has managed to concoct in the manner of the dublin diocesan appointments 2008
3066406 a worrying disregard for the foot soldiers on which the church in dublin depends

3066408 vendors need to name their products theres no question about that and theres unfortunately product specific taxonomy but broad terms like cloud computing those are canvasses that we should all be able to paint our piece of the mural on
3066409 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering

3066417 mobile phones are without question the most underutilized computing platform in the world
3066418 despite the fact that billions of phones are able to run applications industry research shows that less than 5 percent of mobile subscribers around the world are actually running third party applications on their phones cascada mobile believes there are two main reasons why this number is so low first that conditions for mobile application development are a huge challenge limiting the number of mobile developers and applications and second that there are few resources for finding applications that are of interest to subscribers the breeze platform and breeze apps portal solve both halves of this mobile application problem

3066421 a trip to a coffee shop may have saved jeff anderson from an atrocious morning today the senior art director at catalyst marketing design had just walked through his companys downtown lobby on the way to his office with a bite of doughnut in his mouth and a cup of coffee in his hand from higher grounds located down the street from his workplace when a champagne colored cadillac came crashing through the historic building at the corner of south calhoun street and east washington boulevard ten seconds earlier and anderson couldve been hit and thrown much like an empty couch used for visitors that was slammed into a wall by the car
3066422 richard gripp co owner of catalyst said he was in his office when he heard brakes squealing a crash and then two booms he knew the car came into his companys lobby just by the sound then his employees and co workers were running around inside yelling for someone to call 911 although the damage looked extensive he noted the car missed concrete from the historic part of the building and instead only collided with replaceable brick

3066430 i doubt the voters are going to pay much attention to a mistake made nearly fourteen years ago for which apology has been made and accepted i doubt the voters want to spend their valuable time wallowing in the kind of tawdry gossip the new chairman of the idaho republican party appears to relish but if norm semanko is going to make sexual indiscretion the center piece of his leadership he will need to follow the example of our disgraced senior senator and take a wider stance sexual indiscretion is not a one party affair
3066431 tawdry shots between political parties dont serve idahoans who are tired of partisan bickering ive worked for 16 months now to improve the political discourse in this state and this is a step backwards

3066479 i left it up to them i gave them space a computer a partner and a worksheet i said id like you to please find 10 15 artists to put together to make some interesting discussion it was a challenge for them because its an abstract process and they were given a timeline
3066480 each group came up with a different strategy some looked at the work by medium some looked at by content
3066481 the jurors were tasked with trying to identify an interesting thread or theme running through an artists work
3066482 the artists will be given the space to install create new work put up exactly what they put on the web site or do with whatever they like for the most part
3066483 its an opportunity i like engaging people in new dialogue
3066484 i hope these exhibitions put together will help artists see their work in a new perspective artists showing next to someone theyve never shown next to creates a conversation they get to know each other for the audience its exciting too
3066485 were trying to make the exhibition here more exemplary of what artists are working in and showing its actually limiting to have everyone in a cookie cutter kind of 18
3066486 artists will drop off their work one two or three depending on size and the curators will curate the space
3066487 it will be a full color book available throughout the year not just an advocate insert it will be an alphabetical listing each person will get a full page with a full color image and an artist statement
3066488 force india have clearly demonstrated that we have caught up and improved one realises how touch formula one really is and it reinforces the challenge that i have before me for 2009 to be really competitive
3066489 im not only catching up from last season but from the last three seasons and we have caught up even though f1 has become so competitive which is good
3066490 i am quite optimistic however that my experience so far has pointed us in the right direction i now know precisely what im up against so i can plan better maybe i learned the hard way but its good to learn so 2009 will be much more competitive for the force india team
3066491 we didnt use the seamless shift gearbox in budapest but we will introduce it at valencia and as far as im concerned thats it for the development for 2008 and all the focus from now on will be to develop a really competitive car for 2009

3066504 although the early use of p2p networks was for digital piracy p2p networks are increasingly being used for legitimate content distribution including music video and software
3066505 for example grooveshark rvibe we7 and imesh are firms that use p2p networks to distribute music to users the music is licensed from the music labels the files are distributed from users machines and the p2p firms provide software and billing a number of technologies have also emerged to prevent piracy in p2p networks as a result distribution of digital products through p2p networks is likely to become more prevalent
3066506 diffusion models for peer to peer p2p content distribution on the impact of decentralized constrained supply to appreciate their arguments it helps to understand how peer to peer file sharing works
3066507 rvibe pays 5 cents for a 99 cent track grooveshark has recently changed its policy but i think it was originally 10 cents a song our conclusion is that you want to offer really high payments early on and that payments shouldnt be fixed we found in many cases that the referral payment could be higher than the price for example you might initially pay 1 50 for a 99 cent file
3066508 the initial high payment brings in a lot of distributors and it gets them to share files when theres scarcity
3066509 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3066510 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
3066511 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
3066512 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
3066513 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia

3066517 but i said you know what this is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts honestly in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got like a super charge and just took it from there it was unreal

3066526 here is the new cultural expression that has emerged that is exciting on its own because of its message not because of the medium

3066584 never before have so many people been abandoned at once
3066585 it is inconceivable to think about losing 10 000 jobs in the first wave and the estimates run in the 30 000 range as the wave continues
3066586 watching the passers by holding the smart phones in front of them as they walked was like watching a parade of monks with heads bowed over their breviaries
3066587 i dont know how they could spring this on fans during a subprime mortgage crisis where fans are more worried about their homes than psls
3066588 one of the most demanding applications for providing convenient signal connecting points is the floor mounted connector box
3066589 the floor pocket box and the mini floor box solve installation problems by providing a generous array of connector options in an extremely robust package capable of withstanding rigorous use we believe these products will have a positive impact on installations requiring floor mounted connectors
3066590 this is nothing more than really just the impact of the economy
3066591 people are shopping very cautiously and less frequently avoiding impulse buys which are what magazine purchases are
3066592 it is easy to manipulate subscription numbers because publishers can sell them at a loss just to meet their rate base
3066593 the growth may not be high quality subscribers that will renew
3066594 people has been steady over the years and theres probably more quality to the magazine in terms of what they do
3066595 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3066596 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
3066597 venni tra loro e li trovai tutti ubriachi nessuno di loro aveva sete
3066598 oh god oh dylan it must be cold down there it is cold enough on top in november the dirtiest month of the year that killed you on the ninth vile day if only i could take you a bowl of your bread and milk and salt that you always drank at night to warm you up i am not going into that waste allotment of a t s eliot elegy of a cemetery dylan will have to move up in his single ditch snug under the cliff and make room for me then we can keep each other warm or cold or maggot breeding
3066599 and sometimes i have the nerve to pretend that this dylan love never was i can make myself believe in the superfluity of this love for quite a long time then it catches up with me and it is all the crosser for being ignored
3066600 set the mood defining how people have thought of thomas
3066601 this is her first effusion about dylan its so important and so impassioned
3066602 it has played a big role in pride and existence
3066603 that is what i would like to share with people that sense of existence to influence my grandson and hopefully they will continue doing it in the future
3066604 its hard to say what it is but somethings happening
3066605 they are doing something and its unique and its powerful
3066606 its a matter of it being given the support to develop and grow until it really takes off
3066607 but what theyre doing is groove based it goes round and round
3066608 as westerners we tend to think about things as having a beginning a middle and an end native cultures think about time differently and the music reflects that its cyclical
3066609 the point is there is a culture that is at risk
3066610 its almost like a jukebox they are playing the songs that everybody knows back to the people
3066611 its almost reverent the music the young people play and theyre not trying to smash up the old way
3066612 contemporary music in our western sense its often a thing where kids rebel and try and play music that everyone else is going to hate they smash up the old way
3066613 but i think it serves a different cultural role for these kids it really is cultural maintenance between the generations i think its really interesting that its contemporary music thats making that happen
3066614 you can still hear a strong credence clearwater influence in northeast arnhem land in the chord structures the chord sequences the songs theyre kind of old school rocknroll a bit country the rock is kind of fast and almost getting to that reggae backbeat thing a bit like a ska thing
3066615 there is a fine line between black australian music black afro american music there is a fine line between jamaican music
3066616 it is still the black view of the white world
3066617 all we want is to say hello we are the same yet we are different and we want to hold on to that difference because it is our individuality
3066618 we are copying reggae we are imitating but to some degree we are also translating our message borrowing some of their methods
3066619 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3066620 at the end of the day we are responsible for our own lives
3066621 if anything happens to us dont blame somebody else backtrack and look at what you did to contribute to that you also contribute to your successes once you learn that youre on your way
3066622 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3066623 how many times in our lives do we get a chance to build a city
3066624 how many times do we get an opportunity to fix some of the problems that affect 1 1 billion people thats one sixth of humanity
3066625 the right partners do proper design provide basic things that you and i take for granted here
3066626 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3066627 they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife
3066628 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3066629 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody hes been cooperative
3066630 weve had problems before also but this time i dont think we can sort them out we are two different people our values and way of thinking are different i dont think we can be friends

3066647 it is probably impossible to determine definitively the extent to which education services have improved or otherwise over the last decade
3066648 however the analysis conducted for the briefing book suggests that we approach official statistics with caution this matters
3066649 business concerns about school leavers reflect the reality of the changing economy with historic low unemployment and the virtual elimination of low skill jobs

3066671 darin lahoods experience as an aggressive prosecutor and his keen understanding of peoria county indicate that he can provide the new leadership that law enforcement sorely needs
3066672 with lahood we can ensure that incarcerated individuals will respect correctional officers and make for a safer workplace
3066673 our officers believe it is time for a change in the states attorneys office because the current states attorney has not tried cases for correctional officers as diligently as they should be tried thereby putting the officers in harms way the present states attorneys support of our department has dwindled over the years by not prosecuting violent crimes committed against our officers
3066674 these are the individuals who are on the front lines here in peoria they interact daily with murderers rapists and other violent criminals if they receive no support from the states attorney something is terribly wrong i wholeheartedly respect what these people put on the line on a daily basis and know they go the extra mile to protect all of our families as states attorney i intend to go the extra mile to give them the assurance and support that they desperately need

3066776 these shocking and startling figures mean that every council tax payer in staffordshire is paying nearly 30 per head towards funding this very worrying level of absence
3066777 we need to see a range of targeted initiatives aimed at reducing this drag on council resources
3066778 no wonder the county had to increase council tax to above inflation at 4 earlier this year as it has to fund this open sore
3066779 i urge the labour led council to take action to address this
3066780 as an employer the council should be taking action to try and manage absence more effectively as they do in the private sector adopting strategies that include the greater involvement of line managers to combat short term absence and increasing use of occupational health professionals to manage long term absence as the most effective interventions
3066781 whilst it is a fact that the public sector employees nationally take 40 more time off sick than their private sector counterparts that is no reason for the labour administration at stafford to sit on their collective hands
3066782 this is all about good management of people it is about providing employees with well defined jobs roles challenging but realistic targets and the support training and recognition to help them achieve these targets
3066783 if we carry on with this rising trend of absenteeism all of staffordshire residents will suffer the pain of increased levels of council tax
3066784 the cost of sickness absence quoted by the opposition is way off the mark due to crude and basic calculations
3066785 the actual cost is considerably lower at around 9 6 million which we are working hard to lower
3066786 we have a robust approach to managing sickness absence through a combination of support services such as occupational health and counselling
3066787 since april 2008 the average number of sick days has dropped to below 10 per member of staff
3066788 we want to see this downward trend continue and monitor the position on a monthly basis
3066789 from september 2008 we are providing our managers with extra training support and guidance to help them to manage sickness absence even more effectively
3066790 this is a well managed county council with a committed valued and highly skilled workforce which is delivering high quality value for money services for staffordshire people

3066805 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3066806 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3066807 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3066808 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3066813 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3066814 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3066815 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3066816 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3066817 if you dont get out of the car damn nigger ill hit you in the eye
3066818 weve seen many cases where blacks and other minorities have been shot for no reason people are angry but more than that they want answers
3066819 and in the bennis case the quebec ministry of public security has bluntly refused to disclose the original police report of the shooting
3066820 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3066821 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3066822 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3066823 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3066824 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3066825 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3066826 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3066827 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3066828 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3066829 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3066830 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3066831 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3066832 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3066833 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3066834 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3066835 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3066836 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3066837 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3066838 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3066839 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3066840 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3066841 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3066842 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3066843 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3066844 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3066845 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3066846 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3066847 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3066848 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3066849 who are open to doing something on the production side
3066850 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3066851 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3066852 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3066853 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3066854 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3066855 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3066856 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3066857 the benefit to fannie mae from widening credit spreads is limited and capital raises are dilutive to future earnings
3066858 a significant downturn in housing with national home prices falling 20 or more would create meaningful risks for fannie
3066859 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3066860 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3066861 the decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
3066862 parents do not have an unfettered right to dictate the terms of their childrens education
3066863 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3066864 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do
3066865 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3066866 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3066867 they were able to develop such a loyal fan base
3066868 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humour they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3066869 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3066870 i think its important to show what kids really use
3066871 things can take a turn and you can get a big head or get jaded
3066872 the next two weeks were going to be unveiling more and more ads and everybody that we talk to is saying get ready get ready
3066873 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3066874 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3066875 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3066876 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3066877 this is a great opportunity to go and do a natural history of this animal and be able to take that information and apply it to different conservation needs within vietnam and abroad
3066878 they are an important indicator species for the health and status of forests within cat tien
3066879 they are really a charismatic creature with yellow rings around their eyes a nice blue face a big gray belly and black arms and legs
3066880 i never thought id be traveling to vietnam to spend a year chasing monkeys around to see what they eat
3066881 but i got to school and found out that i was very interested in what animals eat especially the nutritional aspects of it
3066882 the big picture of this project is to really get a general idea of what theyre eating
3066883 this is both important in the wild so we can understand what their habitat constraints are and their general needs for the environment theyre living in but this information also can be easily translated over to captivity studies
3066884 er komen minstens twee digitale zalen een nieuwe airconditioning een nieuwe kassa een nieuwe ingang en nieuwe zetels
3066885 de kleine bioscopen die zoals ik zullen omschakelen blijven bestaan het centrum blijft het centrum van de stad met hotels en restaurants maar ook met een buurtbioscoop ik vindt het jammer dat ik een van de zeldzame restanten ben
3066886 het is nog een beetje vakantiestemming op de beurs sommige handelaren zijn nog niet terug
3066887 de gedaalde olieprijs en de sterkere dollar geven steun aan de beurs bedrijven die actief zijn in de vs profiteren van een stijging van de amerikaanse munt dat de stijging vandaag niet heel uitbundig was is logisch gezien de ferme klim van de afgelopen weken
3066888 de speculatie over een overname door boskalis is er wat uitgelopen en de resultaten vielen donderdag lichtelijk tegen dat bij elkaar zet de koers onder druk
3066889 bij 16 10 achter hebben we de eerste set laten lopen
3066890 als het niet loopt zijn we toch in staat met hard werken er bovenop te komen daar zijn we goed in geworden
3066891 dat gepiel we spelen liever tegen teams die net als wij hard slaan
3066892 je moet fel beginnen lukt dat dan lopen we over ze heen ik denk dat we toch hier al hebben laten zien dat we tot de beste teams van het toernooi behoren
3066893 als we als poulewinnaar meteen tegen hen moeten vreet ik mijn slippers op
3066894 i think the cities who look more and more alike are a result of an old balance of power and one that globalization shall substantially weaken and finally lead towards greater diversity
3066895 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3066896 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3066897 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3066898 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3066899 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3066900 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3066901 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3066902 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3066903 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3066904 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3066905 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3066906 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3066907 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3066908 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3066909 yeah we are at a sox game but the cubs are still our team
3066910 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3066911 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3066912 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3066913 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3066914 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3066915 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3066916 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3066917 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3066918 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3066919 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3066920 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3066921 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3066922 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3066923 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3066924 diese krise ist anders ein ereignis wie es nur ein oder zwei mal im jahrhundert vorkommt
3066925 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3066926 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3066929 it is empowered to regulate technical education all over india
3066930 it is empowered to regulate the technical education system in all the areas wherever it is imparted in india
3066931 there cannot be any dichotomy in standards of technical education as it would be against the intention of the legislature in bringing into force the aicte act the icfai society and the icfai university cannot contend that even though they impart technical education they fall outside the purview of the aicte act

3066933 yeah we are at a sox game but the cubs are still our team
3066934 now with social shopping sites product blogs and online ratings and reviews consumers have the means to communicate their opinions about products and companies to tens of thousands of other consumers
3066935 while blogs and customer ratings and reviews have long been a familiar part of the internet commercial landscape
3066936 over the past two years social shopping sites have emerged as another way for customers to share product experiences and opinions
3066937 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3066938 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3066939 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3066940 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3066941 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3066942 all five officers placed on administrative reassignment relieved of duty pending further investigation by the south dakota authorities
3066943 i always said every cloud has a silver lining and that something good comes out of something bad
3066944 being diagnosed with cancer was quite a shock in itself but thats not as hard as dealing with the treatment
3066945 i wouldnt wish chemotherapy on anyone its horrendous the last year has probably been the worst of my life but this year could be the best
3066946 im all clear at the moment but i have a scan later this week
3066947 i just try not to think about it and not to worry about the results
3066948 army cookbooks are extremely rare and i have never seen one which dates from victorian times before
3066949 it is incredible that smiths army records have survived after all they are 132 years old and the cookbook was written 118 years ago
3066950 i am happy to sell them because i dont think my son would be interested and i dont want them to be thrown away if anything happens to me
3066951 win or lose you just hope to see the extra effort there and tonight we had that
3066952 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
3066953 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3066954 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3066955 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3066957 las relaciones ruso estadounidenses podr an verse afectadas por esta agresi n contra el estado soberano y democr tico de georgia
3066958 si la escalada peligrosa y desproporcionada de su parte contin a tendr un impacto significativo a largo plazo en las relaciones ruso estadounidenses
3066959 acaben las operaciones militares y que nos abstengamos de represalias que podr an degenerar en un conflicto a n m s importante

3066968 the discussions will help my colleagues and i to improve programs for the citizens of our district province and region
3066969 i think its important that states and provinces share best practices and innovative ideas as well as find ways to tackle border security issues and how they impact commerce
3066970 the economic challenges that we face every day in prince edward island are similar to the challenges facing the states and provinces that share our region

3066992 al lado del secretario de estado por c mo est trabajando contra el dopaje
3066993 hoy es un momento duro pero no es para echarnos a llorar estamos persiguiendo el dopaje como pocos pa ses en el mundo
3066994 si se han hecho seis controles en el ltimo mes lo que no se puede hacer es perseguir hasta su casa a los corredores para ver qu se toman o qu se inyectan
3066995 defiendo al deporte espa ol y a la federaci n espa ola de ciclismo no vamos a conseguir que nunca haya dopaje pero lucharemos las 24 horas contra l

3067010 just recently having been at the iihf headquarters in zurich and talking a lot about these issues im cautiously optimistic that we have a real good shot of signing on to a new transfer agreement
3067011 the russians have not been part of it for a number of years and at this point my sense is that they probably will recluse themselves from any transfer agreement that might be signed in the near term
3067012 on the other hand i do think there is a strong interest on the part of most of the other federations certainly the finns the swedes the czechs the slovaks the germans the canadians the u s to sign off on a new agreement
3067013 the problem you get without a transfer agreement is a lot of teams are reluctant to draft european and russian players
3067014 teams feel the risk is too high that theyre not going to be able to sign the player
3067015 i think for the long term interest of the game we want to have the best players in the world playing in our league and a fair transfer agreement would facilitate getting those players to come over to north america and play
3067016 as long as the transfer agreement makes sense economically for the nhl and also makes sense for the individual federations that it doesnt terribly deplete their local and national teams that it doesnt damage hockey globally it will work
3067017 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

3067026 right now a perfect storm of food scarcity global warming skyrocketing oil prices and an exploding world population is driving up food prices and plunging humanity into a global food crisis of biblical proportions
3067027 world agriculture has entered a new unsustainable and politically risky period
3067028 if food supplies dont keep pace with population growth prices are likely to climb further economic growth in rich and poor nations alike could suffer and some fear violent conflicts could ensue
3067029 i dont want to alarm anybody but maybe its time for americans to start stockpiling food

3067080 a homeowner who has spent at least 31 of their income on a mortgage has an existing high interest sub prime loan with lets say countrywide financial the loan may already be in default as is 48 of countrywides 30 billion sub prime portfolio the borrower can refinance with the new fha on a 30 year fixed rate loan at an interest rate significantly lower than any prime borrower on a conventional basis countrywide agrees to write down their mortgage to 90 of the current appraised value in exchange for a new loan guaranteed by fha the borrower presumably now has a loan that is affordable countrywide owns a loan that is fully valued on its balance sheet and the risk of default is assumed by taxpayers

3067092 the new optical materials or metamaterials as they are known are extremely difficult to manufacture but have the power to transform the way we use optics
3067093 cloaks of invisibility and lenses that resolve extremely small objects beyond the reach of the current generation of lenses are two applications that would be made possible these papers take a major step towards these goals
3067094 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3067095 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3067096 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3067097 bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3067098 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3067099 over time the mortgage market should continue to improve from its current position the number of products will steadily increase and rates will lower with increased competition between lenders
3067100 the standard factors which usually determine the rates at which mortgage rates are set including bank base rate swap rates and libor rates are all much lower than this time last year yet the rates on offer are much higher
3067101 as house prices continue to fall and the risk of default increases the lenders are pricing more for risk and as a result these standard factors are not quite as influential on the rates as they once were
3067102 strong voluminous and a powerful indictment of his systematic misrule and usurpation of parliaments powers

3067105 his options of staying in power are really limited now
3067106 we have consistently said the internal politics of pakistan are an issue for the pakistani people to decide
3067107 i think 70 percent of the people are wondering when the prices are going to come down and when were going to be able to put food on the table

3067126 i hit one on the numbers to the goal line and thats what they want they dont want it through the end zone you have to kick it about five yards deep in the end zone about 75 yards for them to not return it if coach jon fabris wanted that i could to that for him but right now he wants it to the right and on the numbers so thats what im trying to do thats what im shooting for im on the first team on the kickoffs thats where they have me but all i can control is my performance and thats what im focusing on

3067144 in my eyes the charge against judaism became a grave one the moment i discovered the jewish activities in the press in art in literature and the theatre all unctuous protests were now more or less futile here was a pestilence a moral pestilence with which the public was being infected it was worse than the black plague of long ago to claim that in the presentation of facts and views its attitude was impartial seemed to me to contain more falsehood than truth
3067145 there is no greater power in the world today than that wielded by the manipulators of public opinion in america no king or pope of old no conquering general or high priest ever disposed of a power even remotely approaching that of the few dozen men who control americas mass media of news and entertainment

3067147 londons telegraph newspaper reports that some of the fireworks which appeared over beijing during the television broadcast of the olympic opening ceremony were actually computer generated but hold on its not necessarily as bad as you think the faked fireworks were actually set off at the stadium but because of potential dangers in filming the display live from a helicopter viewers at home were shown a pre recorded computer generated shot
3067148 they want this ceremony to be cinema in real time but what youre watching right now is actually cinematic its all animation of these footsteps leading to the national stadium

3067177 the egyptian government imposed a new measure which increases the extent of censorship on internet users and violates their right to privacy
3067178 their names email and phone numbers before they use the internet
3067179 this severely abusive procedure proves that the security policies aim to impose constraints and censorship on internet users
3067180 the court is suggesting that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law this has a tremendous chilling effect on research we intend to fight it with everything weve got
3067181 we disagree with the ruling but we are not going to disobey it

3067211 we missed out on a good opportunity to beat sri lanka
3067212 we did really well in galle to come back and we did not capitalise on the winning of the toss here you cannot lose five wickets in the first 40 overs of a test that happened to us quite regularly in this series which is something we need to think about
3067213 for a new batter to go straightway and face two spinners it is never easy
3067214 people who got starts if they had converted it would have been a different story i do not want to give excuses overall we did not play quality cricket to win the series
3067215 it is not just one or two players who we should blame
3067216 it is important that everyone contributes i do not think there was enough contribution throughout the series from the middle order consistently even the lower order did not contribute consistently except one game here that is obviously something that let us down
3067217 thats still a lot of time for us to think and reflect on what went wrong
3067218 this intervention in the tariff will be great for our customers maximum usage of the network and it is a plus to the economy as a result of this our network is working to its full capacity

3067257 chinese pingpong team faces big pressure carries the expectations of 1 3 billion at the beijing olympics
3067258 in the team of course they will win the thing is not if theyre going to win the thing is how many matches theyre going to lose in team one or two
3067259 in singles even if theyre very big favorites they only have three players so if one plays not on the top and loses early the pressure is going to be unbelievably big
3067260 as a player i think this is the biggest title you can win the olympic games in china
3067261 technically the players are as good spains but with a different style and mentality we have to be very confident in ourselves
3067262 we have a very good team its important to focus on ourselves we can qualify for the world cup we will be in south africa im sure
3067263 the level at the euros was good we have that same level or better
3067264 i must transmit the spirit of those teams to the players to play with confidence in our four games so far step by step we have been getting better
3067265 im convinced in the next match they will play with lots of confidence
3067266 we need good organisation to play quickly and not always the long ball he said
3067267 there are moments when you are actually in a trance
3067268 all you know is that you are there and you have your opponent
3067269 i was completely isolated from the rest of the world what came out was simply natural
3067270 when youre afraid and start thinking about it thats when you get hit
3067271 this was an extremely good match full of strong emotions
3067272 i didnt sleep all night i just lay there listening to my heart beating

3067280 i think you should be offering this petition to your king
3067281 a friend of mine from gangtok was asked whether gangtok was closer to bangkok but i wonder whether that was more due to the lack of geographical knowledge on the part of that individual or a simple mistake
3067282 hope we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3067283 despite the notice were still working diligently to reorganize and restructure to get out of our financial predicament there are a few different groups of investors were talking to to get to the bank before september 12
3067284 we did have the fundraiser that helped buy us some time
3067285 now were only having music on a few days in august but if things go well well have an announcement that things will go on the scope of what needs to happen is beyond a few better nights of business its about restructuring
3067286 now people are thinking about the cost of taking an hour drive and paying 25 for a ticket bands are having a hard time traveling and real estate values went down although we had to bring in the capital for improvements
3067287 were looking at things like changes in the business model where we might be in the minority role half of the building isnt even being utilized and we can bring in improvements maybe create a function room or a place for artist space rehearsal rooms expand the restaurant hopefully therell be some people with financial backing to make the building fully utilized

3067301 when however thou dost contemplate the innermost essence of all things and the individuality of each thou wilt behold the signs of thy lords mercy in every created thing and see the spreading rays of his names and attributes throughout all the realm of being with evidences which none will deny
3067302 know thou that the divine essence which is called the invisible of the invisibles never to be described beyond the reach of mind is sanctified above any mention any definition or hint or allusion any acclamation or praise
3067303 when however thou dost contemplate the innermost essence of all things and the individuality of each thou wilt behold the signs of thy lords mercy in every created thing and see the spreading rays of his names and attributes throughout all the realm of being with evidences which none will deny save the froward and the unaware
3067304 and whensoever thou dost gaze upon creation all entire and dost observe the very atoms thereof thou wilt note that the rays of the sun of truth are shed upon all things and shining within them and telling of that splendours its mysteries and the spreading of its lights look thou upon the trees upon the blossoms and fruits even upon the stones here too wilt thou behold the suns rays shed upon them clearly visible within them and manifested by them
3067305 if we try to conceive of a time when creation was nonexistent when there were no subjects or creatures under divine dominion and control divinity itself would disappear there would be a cessation of the bounty of god just as the kingship and favor of an earthly monarch would disappear if his kingdom did not exist
3067306 when we consider the phenomenal sun we see that its heat and light are continuous
3067307 likewise the divine bounties of the sun of reality are perpetual its light is forever shining its love is forever radiating its bounty never ceases it could not be said that the power and effulgence of god was ever subject to cessation it could not be claimed that the divinity of the almighty one had come to an end for the divinity of god is eternal therefore the divine bounties whether phenomenal and accidental or spiritual and ideal are perpetual
3067308 the process of his creation hath had no beginning and can have no end otherwise it would necessitate the cessation of his celestial grace god hath raised up prophets and revealed books as numerous as the creatures of the world and will continue to do so to everlasting
3067309 a drop of the billowing ocean of his endless mercy hath adorned all creation with the ornament of existence and a breath wafted from his peerless paradise hath invested all beings with the robe of his sanctity and glory a sprinkling from the unfathomed deep of his sovereign and all pervasive will hath out of utter nothingness called into being a creation which is infinite in its range and deathless in its duration the wonders of his bounty can never cease and the stream of his merciful grace can never be arrested the process of his creation hath had no beginning and can have no end
3067310 over the past few years there has been a tectonic shift in the basis of good taste

3067319 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3067320 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers

3067349 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3067350 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so

3067358 lightwave played an instrumental role for the embassy visual effects in rendering all the digital shots of iron mans mark 1 suit and enhancing several scenes with animation and particles
3067359 lightwave 3d gave us the power to create exactly what the director envisioned from duplicating the complex look of the amazing practical suit the animation of doors that get punched off their hinges to the volumetric smoke and debris when the mark 1 is flying and crash landing
3067360 lightwave 3d is a work horse for extremely talented artists like michael and his team who push it to the limit every day lightwave fits within any budget and pipeline
3067361 newtek is honored that the embassy chose lightwave to help put iron man into action

3067372 bitte helfen sie mir ich schw re dass ich niemals mehr stehlen werde
3067373 h tte ich den wunsch gehabt ihr geld zu behalten dann h tte ich nicht hier auf sie gewartet
3067374 ich habe jahrelang fern meiner heimatstadt gearbeitet und bin seitdem nie mehr zu hause gewesen ich habe eine betagte mutter zu hause und heute war ich endlich in der lage all mein geld das ich die ganzen jahre gespart habe zu nehmen und heimzukehren um meine alte mutter zu unterst tzen doch ungl cklicherweise habe ich all mein erspartes geld auf dem weg verloren
3067375 h tte ich den wunsch gehabt ihr geld zu behalten dann h tte ich nicht hier auf sie gewartet
3067376 wenn jeder beamte so klar und aufrecht sein k nnte wie tao shu m sste ich mich nicht darum sorgen ob sich alles in harmonie befindet
3067377 also wir ermutigen leute ihre traditionellen kampfkunsttechniken vorzuf hren solange es echte kampfkunstf higkeiten sind werden wir ihnen ganz bestimmt unsere aufmerksamkeit schenken nat rlich m ssen wir auch unsere aufmerksamkeit auf ihre kampftugend und traditionellen moralischen werte lenken also aus der perspektive der techniken in diesem wettbewerb sind dies die aspekte die relativ wichtig sind
3067378 die kampfkunst hat auch ihre inneren bedeutungen das hei t von dem k nstlerischen aspekt her gleicht es sehr dem traditionellen chinesischen tanz der traditionellen chinesischen kultur und anderen dingen wie traditionelle chinesische kunst musik oder kalligraphie sie sind alle tief in der chinesischen geschichte verwurzelt zum beispiel wurde in der vergangenheit wert darauf gelegt dass man kampfkunst durch musik praktizierte xiang zhang ein kampfkunstmeister der kurz vor der gr ndung der han dynastie 206 v chr 220 n chr in china lebte hat w hrend er spielte sein schwert geschwungen und sang voller emotion diese geschichte enth lt die bedeutungen dieses aspektes deshalb hat die kampfkunst diese dinge mit eingeschlossen
3067379 wir hoffen kampftugend f rdern zu k nnen wir hoffen dass jeder in diesem aspekt eine hohe ebene darstellen kann aber in der realit t k nnen wir es nur bef rworten echte kampftugend liegt in der selbstverbesserung einer person was aus der tiefe seines herzens reflektiert wird seiner selbstkontrolle pers nlichen kultivierung und so wie sich jemand selbst pr sentiert dies ist sehr wichtig
3067380 wir wissen dass kampfkunst die aspekte von angriff verteidigung und k mpfen beinhaltet was jedoch ist die echte hohe ebene nehmen wir tai chi quan als beispiel bei dem prinzip von tai chi quan geht es nicht um den angriff sondern wenn andere dich angreifen dann hast du die f higkeit ihren angriff aufzul sen diese aufl sung deutet auf die berlegenheit deiner h heren ebene hin ganz gleich wie viel st rke der angreifer anwendet so hart wird er fallen je gr er die gewalt die er anwendet desto tiefer wird er fallen aus diesem aspekt reflektiert die kampfkunstf higkeit an sich direkt die kampftugend einer person ich habe ihn nicht geschlagen sondern er fiel selbst hin als er mich angriff deshalb kann kampfkunst in verschiedene bereiche unterteilt werden im niedrigsten bereich legt sie wert auf den angriff in einem h heren bereich legt sie wert auf die verteidigung in einem bereich der noch h her ist manifestiert sie sich weder als angriff noch als verteidigung stattdessen kann man vollkommen entsprechend seiner absicht agieren so als ob man ein g ttliches wesen sei
3067381 alle meine fragen wurden beantwortet es gibt keine zweifel mehr also glaube ich dass zhuan falun zu lesen besser ist als irgendetwas anderes
3067382 jetzt so lange ich ruhig werden kann wenn ich ein oder zwei s tze lese kann ich ganz klar die wahre bedeutung erkennen ohne auf die erkl rungen anderer zur ckgreifen zu m ssen der grund daf r ist dass das was wir von dafa gelernt haben u erst hoch ist und wenn wir dinge niedriger ebenen sehen sind wir uns ber alles ganz klar und haben keine zweifel mehr
3067383 ich praktizierte viele jahre kampfkunst und fand den gro artigsten nutzen und die bedeutendsten dinge als ich das buch zhuan falun las in den vergangenen jahren seit ich ein praktizierender wurde f hle ich mich sehr ausgef llt und ich mache mir ber nichts mehr sorgen da es nichts besseres f r mich gibt als mich im falun dafa zu kultivieren

3067386 sex is an important and positive part of the lives of their 70 year old participants and more so for the current cohort of men and women than for their predecessors in 1971
3067387 we still have this stereotype of elderly people with their bath chairs and canes staggering around who couldnt possibly be having sex but that isnt the case
3067388 i am slightly concerned that this will be interpreted in a way that suggests that if youre not having sex in your 70s you are doing something wrong
3067389 there are still plenty of people who choose not to have sex

3067394 i prefer to model in lightwave 3d because of the interactivity of its comprehensive modeling toolset which allows me to turn around accurate models very quickly all these shots were in imax resolution and lightwave ensured that the models would hold up and look realistic
3067395 lightwave also allowed us to build a complete model quickly while giving us the flexibility to replace as little or as much of the original plate as was needed on the fly
3067396 every day i am reminded about how versatile lightwave 3d is it is used for 300 million plus blockbusters as well as for television animated shorts ad work video game design or any other graphics project
3067397 the fact that framestore chose lightwave 3d for modeling key scenes of the dark knight which is on its way to being one of the biggest movie box office successes ever is gratifying for the newtek team

3067415 google has always said it will never compromise the objectivity of its search results
3067416 if you repeat anything enough people will come to believe it
3067417 the goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users
3067418 we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers
3067419 there is little evidence that knol has recieved favorable treatment
3067420 google has long insisted that it has no plans to own or create content and that it is a friend not a foe of media companies
3067421 our vision remains to be the best conduit that we can be connecting people between whatever their search is and the answer they are looking for
3067422 for that reason we are not interested in owning or creating content
3067423 the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth

3067432 mccain has tried to turn the 2008 election into a vote on national security

3067451 there is a tiny cell component that is unique to germ cells the precursors to egg and sperm called nuage which means cloud in french other researchers recently suspected that nuage was involved in keeping genes from jumping around in germ cells of the female fruit fly
3067452 but until this mouse study no one knew for sure if it was involved in mammalian germ cells to test if the mouse nuage played a similar role in mammals we focused on a mouse protein called maelstrom whose distant relative protein in the fruit fly was implicated in the other study
3067453 we found that without the gene the process of meiosis was severely impaired
3067454 there was a profound defect in interactions of parental chromosomes a process known as synapsis leading to death of germ cells this was clear evidence that the protein is vital to the formation of sperm
3067455 we observed massive flooding of the cytoplasm and nuclei of germ cells by transposons in the mutant mice
3067456 this was the first time such a phenomenon was observed in germ cells of any species
3067457 the last surprise for the scientists was the observation that contrary to the current view in the field the silencing of jumping genes does not occur one time only in male germ cells during the mouse fetal development
3067458 since the jumping genes are not silenced just once during the development of the fetus but every time new sperm are produced during a mouse life its possible that germ cells may employ transposons in some fundamental way in male germline meiosis this research is the first such clue of that possibility we will be very busy over the next few years trying to crack this and other puzzles of maelstroms role in controlling meiosis and sperm production
3067459 we received very reliable information that the russians decided to move towards gori thats why we decided to pull out all our troops and to relocate them to defend tbilisi
3067460 we are right now driving through the town and i see no trace of troops or military vehicles it is absolutely deserted
3067461 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3067462 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3067463 russia of course will take its peacekeeping mission to a logical conclusion we will strive for working relations with all participants of this conflict
3067464 russian peacekeepers and support units are carrying out an operation aimed at preventing georgian forces from regrouping to carry new attacks on south ossetia senaki is one of the places where such actions were underway
3067465 this provocation was aimed at occupying south ossetia abkhazia and then all of georgia
3067466 although the irs planning for the stimulus payments was generally sufficient we noted areas where improvements were needed
3067467 management addressed our concerns in a timely manner which helped to ensure the accuracy and consistency of information provided externally and internally and reduced the risk of errors when stimulus only returns were processed and payments were issued
3067468 we have the same discussion every three years they always wait until the last minute
3067469 were keeping in place essential elements that we will need when we are ready to move back to discussing comprehensive reforms

3067489 penetrating analysis in a lively style on a wide range of issues
3067490 i dont like it when people contact me out of the blue
3067491 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3067492 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia
3067493 the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3067494 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3067495 continued aggression against georgia and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond south ossetia will only serve to damage russias international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe
3067496 peaceful and speedy resolution to this crisis which maintains georgias territorial and political integrity

3067499 well everybody else is negative why should i be any different
3067500 traditional revenue sources will not be sufficient to fund games development
3067501 if you look at the very narrow definition of the gaming market people are saying the software business will be down 20 percent by 2011 versus this year
3067502 something is going to have to be there to make up the difference and take us beyond that threshold
3067503 over recent years rentokil initial had acquired and disposed of a large number of businesses historically software acquisitioning was completed on a local basis we did not have a clear understanding of our estate in terms of compliance or numbers we needed to get controls in place as quickly as possible
3067504 what you are telling me is that to help my clients in the long term i should really suck now
3067505 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3067506 wow you look much better in those pictures than you actually look in person
3067507 how can somone as wonderful as you not be married or at least in a committed relationship
3067508 whats wrong with you there must be something wrong with you for you to be single at your age are you crazy i bet youre crazy
3067509 how can someone as wonderful as you not be married or at least in a committed relationship
3067510 because i havent met anyone who makes my life better than it already is
3067511 this pattern of attack appears aimed not at restoring any status quo ante in south ossetia but rather at toppling the democratically elected government of georgia
3067512 that makes russias recent actions against the georgians all the more alarming
3067513 in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3067514 and look i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3067515 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3067516 life is a journey time is a river the door is ajar
3067517 within 12 01 per cent over all wholesale price index wpi based inflation for the week ending july 26 the contribution of food articles is 5 58 per cent last year this figure was 9 74 per cent as of july 28

3067519 people were sitting short at around 42 07 08 levels when the news came that ecb norms may not be relaxed which is when the rupee started to fall
3067520 even with what is a serious situation in georgia with pipelines threatened perhaps we havent had much of a bounce back
3067521 all it seems to have done is halted the speed of the fall
3067522 us inventories are indicating that the market is a little bit tighter than people think and that it isnt a one way bet

3067525 emotional trauma can feel like a massive bruise to the brain
3067526 the result can be a little like a concussion especially if you had a major head injury earlier in your life
3067527 data center building depreciation is often carried separately from data center mechanical and electrical equipment utility bills often go to a centralized energy function site operation costs for technicians security staff power and cooling equipment maintenance property taxes and other costs are often split between facilities and it budgets nowhere is the total picture consolidated
3067528 spending 2 500 on a server really means spending between 8 300 and 15 400 in facility capital to provide the necessary space for housing the server and powering it
3067529 just the electricity required to provide power and cooling will exceed the cost of the server in six years utility bills virtually never go to it and often dont go to facilities either which inhibits conservation
3067530 for an organization with 5 000 servers the industry rule of thumb is that up to 30 are technologically obsolete
3067531 if we did this on a broad national scale do we really need to be building all the new data centers or could we defer a large portion of this investment into the future our companies and economy would be far better off if that money went into new application development instead of bricks and mortar
3067532 one companys it department decided to invest 22 million in blade servers but forgot to inform facilities the facility investment required to merely plug in the blades was an unplanned 54 million an additional unplanned 30 million was required to run the blades over three years so what appeared to be a 22 million decision was really an enterprise decision of over 106 million

3067561 tamastische mensen hebben nergens zin in en hun energie klontert letterlijk samen en ze hebben vaak ook een hele grauwe schubbige huid

3067668 mi sono sposata molto giovane piena di amore e di illusioni credevo che avrei condiviso tutta la vita con mio marito ci giurammo reciprocamente fedelt e rispetto e creammo una famiglia ma presto tutto cambi io ero la moglie devota che si occupava della casa e dei bambini mio marito continu a seguire la sua carriera il suo successo e la sua immagine esteriore per lui erano pi importanti della famiglia smise di rispettarmi e io smisi di rispettare lui ci facemmo del male a vicenda e un giorno scoprii che non lo amavo pi e che neppure lui mi amava ma i bambini avevano bisogno di un padre e quella fu la scusa che adottai per non lasciarlo facendo anzi di tutto per sostenerlo ora i bambini sono diventati adulti e se ne sono andati non ho pi scuse per restare con lui tra noi non c rispetto n gentilezza so anche che se trovassi un altro sarebbe la stessa cosa perch lamore non esiste non ha senso cercare ci che non esiste e per questo piango
3067669 hai ragione lamore non esiste lo cerchiamo apriamo il nostro cuore ci rendiamo vulnerabili e troviamo solo egoismo questo ci fa del male anche quando pensiamo di esserne usciti indenni non importa quante volte ci proviamo accade sempre la stessa cosa perch allora continuare a cercare lamore
3067670 ma cos diverso da ci che ho provato in passato non ci che dicono i poeti o la religione perch io non mi sento responsabile per lei non le chiedo nulla e non ho bisogno che si occupi di me non sento la necessit di incolparla dei miei problemi insieme stiamo bene e ci divertiamo io rispetto il suo modo di pensare e lei non mi mette mai in imbarazzo non mi sento geloso quando con altri e non invidio i suoi successi forse lamore esiste davvero alla fine ma non ci che tutti credono che sia
3067671 so esattamente a cosa ti riferisci forse dopotutto lamore esiste ma non ci che pensavamo che fosse

3067680 the fact that some of the banks in the consortium of lenders are unhappy with our recent aggressive repositioning efforts cannot be enough reason to thwart due process rule of law or indeed the decision of the federal government to seek a new core investor in nitel
3067681 what transcorp has been focused on since the restructuring of the board and management of nitel is to literally pluck the low hanging fruits which will return nitel to operational efficiency and thus make it attractive to a new core investor
3067682 we are acutely aware of our responsibility to all stakeholders including the banks we are committed to meeting those obligations but wherever there is a difference of opinion on how to proceed the legal agreement which formed the basis of borrowing will be relied upon

3067685 for a smooth transition to digital broadcasting in nigeria government should set up a digitization implementation task force to plan and execute the process and provide adequate fund to midwife the transition
3067686 it was necessary for nigeria to join the rest of the world in the race to meet the itu resolutions and deadline for the transition so that the country would not be left behind and be turned into a dumping ground for obsolete analogue broadcast equipment
3067687 technology has grown rapidly since the current broadcasting system was established programming sources have increased and digital video technology has advanced giving us the ability to expand broadcasting capabilities the current analogue system will not support future expansion

3067771 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe

3067773 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end

3067856 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3067857 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3067858 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3067859 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3067860 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3067949 richard dawkins is at it again trying to wean the non converted away from religion this time in his examination of dawkins in choosing a form of firebrand fundamentalist atheism over the discipline science is no longer the champion of reason but rather a kind of evangelical against religion snip one obvious problem for dawkins is that he battles to hold two rather inharmonious positions at once he is the scientist disciplined in observation and objectivity but also he is the emotionally charged evangelical atheist
3067950 since the release of his bestseller dawkins has been unable to separate the two positions gone are the days of the professor dissecting halibut in front of an audience of pre teens divided into those who are averting their squeamish gazes and those who cant for the life of them turn away now even in his scientific capacity dawkins is belligerent

3067994 the spanish have been lax in their attitude to doping and this positive test is the result of that they need to deal with that issue
3067995 its an extremely regrettable experience if the positive is confirmed it is a stain on spanish sport
3067996 if confirmed it is bad for the athlete bad for the athletes health bad for spanish sport and for all of us
3067997 we will apply spamish anti doping legislation to the full
3067998 we will apply spanish law to her case and to whoever encouraged her to take the substance and who supplied the substance to her

3068014 ive been trying to subpoena senator jesse andersen lujan since he was a private person when he was working with cyfred to come to court to testify we
3068015 i was stunned yesterday when i posed the question of how the church views fallen catholics to karl keating whom im sure you know
3068016 whosoever therefore knowing that the catholic church was made necessary by christ would refuse to enter or to remain in it could not be saved
3068017 certainly if i am obliged to bring religion into afterdinner toasts which indeed does not seem quite the thing i shall drink to the pope if you please still to conscience first and to the pope afterwards
3068018 the dominance of the idea of conscience in newman does not signify tha the in the nineteenth century and in contrast to objectivistic neoscholasticism espoused a philosophy or theology of subjectivity conscience for newman does not mean that the subject is the standard vis a vis the claims of authority in a truthless world a world which lives from the compromise between the claims of the subject and the claims of the social order much more than that conscience signifies the perceptible and demanding presence of the voice of truth in the subject himself it is the overcoming of mere subjectivity in the encounter of the interiority of man with the truth from god
3068019 an inner ontological tendency within man who is created in the likeness of god toward the divine from its origin mans being resonates with some things and clashes with others this anamnesis non amnesia of the origin which results from the godlike constitution of our being is not a conceptually articulated knowing a store of retrievable contents it is so to speak an inner sense a capacity to recall so that the one whom it addresses if he is not turned in on himself hears its echo from within he sees thats it that is what my nature points to and seeks
3068020 the anamnesis instilled in our being needs one might say assistance from without so that it can become aware of itself but this from without is not something set in opposition to anamnesis but ordered to it it has a maieutic function imposes nothing foreign but brings to fruition what is proper to anamnesis namely its interior openness to the truth
3068021 fully incorporated into the church are those who possessing the spirit of christ accept all the means of salvation given to the church together with her entire organization and who are joined in the visible structure of the church of christ who rules her through the supreme pontiff and the bishops
3068022 the vatican council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals social groups and every human power so that within due limits nobody is forced to act against his convictions nor ia anyone to be restrained from acting in accordance with his convictions in religious matters in private of in public alone or in association with others the council further declares that at the right to religious freedom is based on the very dignity of the human person as known through the revealed word of god and by reason itself
3068023 to this catholic unity of the people of god therefore all are called and they belong to it or are ordered to it in various ways whether they be catholic faithful or others who believe in christ of finally all people everywhere who by the grace of god are called to salvation
3068024 the universality of salvation means that it is granted not only to those who explicitly believe in christ and have entered the church since salvation is offered to all it must be made concretely available to all but it is clear that today as in the past many people do not have an opportunity to come to know or accept the gospel revelation or to enter the church the social and cultural conditions in which they live do not permit this and frequently they have been brought up in other religious traditions for such people salvation in christ is accessible by virtue of a grace which while having a mysterious relationship to the church does not make them formally part of the church but enlightens them in a way which is accommodated to their spiritual and material situation this grace comes from christ it is the result of his sacrifice and is communicated by the holy spirit in enables each person to attain salvation through his or her free cooperation

3068038 last week mexicos federal electoral institute ife was up in arms over a cloning scandal mexican electoral law states that politicians may not politicize the implementation of government programs by advertising them alongside photos of themselves a creative mayor in the town of toluca a mexico city suburb actually located in the neighboring state of mexico decided to get around the law by using a stunt double or clone as the press has been referring to it a few days after the scandal broke mexican daily reforma interviewed the man behind the mayors publicity campaign the publicist explained that he had used a local citizen who looked somewhat like the mayor and then applied the magic of photoshop to improve the similarities
3068039 we can no longer be prescriptive about taking part in either major combat operations or stabilisation operations the boundary between them has become increasingly blurred the antithesis of the beloved binary response i cannot envisage a conflict where there will be no role for stabilisation operations but equally stabilisation is highly likely to involve combat as it does today but more importantly the army does not subscribe to the view that major combat operations are a thing of the past

3068072 diffusion models for peer to peer p2p content distribution on the impact of decentralized constrained supply to appreciate their arguments it helps to understand how peer to peer file sharing works
3068073 rvibe pays 5 cents for a 99 cent track grooveshark has recently changed its policy but i think it was originally 10 cents a song our conclusion is that you want to offer really high payments early on and that payments shouldnt be fixed we found in many cases that the referral payment could be higher than the price for example you might initially pay 1 50 for a 99 cent file
3068074 the initial high payment brings in a lot of distributors and it gets them to share files when theres scarcity
3068075 we should be very careful from making it sound like we are withdrawing from iraq because we have to build up in afghanistan
3068076 youre starting to see people say this when they werent saying it before
3068077 we tend to be country specific when we talk about how to defeat international terrorism rather than looking at the whole dynamic the dynamic is that terrorism works the seams of international law we cant create stable societies in places like afghanistan that cant be our objective

3068097 we would never have known that she was good at anything she talked more about the football and about people like john charles than about her own achievements
3068098 we would never have dreamed she was a world record holder
3068099 it was a problem trying to find swimming baths in the area in which to train in those days particularly ones that were big enough
3068100 she would swim in the taff race in roath park lake but im not sure how she managed it really
3068101 there certainly would not have been any lanes or starting blocks it would have been easy to get lost in a large olympic pool you would never have swum in before
3068102 we do know however that she used to be a breast stroke swimmer but a coach advised her to convert to freestyle about three or four years before the olympics he must have seen her talent in that stroke
3068103 unlike the olympics today when they arrive weeks ahead to help athletes prepare the british team arrived in stockholm just in time for the games
3068104 they crossed the sea by boat to reach sweden but every single person was ill except for my grandmother
3068105 they did not have any formal uniforms but you had to be smart the team also had a chaperone rather than a coach
3068106 her swimming costume was made of pure silk and had a gb badge on it without the badge she could pass this swimming costume through her wedding ring it is extraordinary really
3068107 the costume also had to have a bra and knickers thing inside because when it got wet it went completely see through
3068108 nicole cook has put so much into it shes already competed in two olympics which is a long time in itself to be at the top of your game
3068109 that sport is so gruelling and closely fought that sheer determination is the difference between winning and not winning
3068110 but it was difficult in a different way for my grandmother nothing was laid on for you i dont think they got the help they have now and the training they did was limited

3068147 wir haben heute eine freund verloren sinowatz war bundeskanzler in einer besonders schwierigen zeit vor pr gte er mit seiner arbeit mehr als ein jahrzehnt sterreichische bildungspolitik

3068164 the articles features industry analysis commentaries and product reviews published in cloud computing journal reflect how the convergence of the grid virtualization and soa concepts enables the business implementation of cloud computing for utility and saas services
3068165 its a convergence of more and harder training older athletes training for longer more technology and more people
3068166 you hear about doping today but in the old days training was considered unethical and people who were manual labourers were banned from competition
3068167 now you see more and more people participating for longer because the media and commercial footprint of amateur sport is so much greater and there is so much more of an opportunity for people making a living doing this
3068168 i tried to help lauren get the sex tape back for a year
3068169 reagan spoke to americas longing for order our need to believe that we are not simply subject to blind impersonal forces but that we can shape our individual and collective destinies so long as we rediscover the traditional virtues of hard work patriotism personal responsibility optimism and faith
3068170 a movement that insists not only that christianity is americas dominant faith but that a particular fundamentalist brand of that faith should drive public policy
3068171 and there is the absolute belief in the authority of majority will
3068172 for its precisely the pursuit of ideological purity the rigid orthodoxy and the sheer predictability of our current political debate that keeps us from finding new ways to meet the challenges we face as a country
3068173 our individualism has always been bound by a set of communal values we value community patriotism and the obligations of citizenship a faith in something bigger than ourselves honesty fairness humility kindness courtesy and compassion
3068174 that because the rules of the constitution were contingent on time and place and the ambitions of the men who drafted them our interpretation of the rules will necessarily reflect the same contingency the same raw competition the same imperatives cloaked in high minded phrasing of those factions that ultimately prevail
3068175 what the framework of our constitution can do is organize the way by which we argue about our future designed to force us into a conversation a deliberative democracy in which all citizens are required to engage in a process of testing their ideas against an external reality persuading others of their point of view and building shifting alliances of consent
3068176 the absence of even rough agreement on the facts puts every opinion on equal footing and therefore eliminates the basis for thoughtful compromise
3068177 in each and every period of great economic upheaval and transition weve depended on government action to open up opportunity encourage competition and make the market work better
3068178 the united states has 3 percent of the worlds oil reserves we use 25 percent of the worlds oil we cant drill our way out of the problem
3068179 between 1971 and 2001 while the median wage and salary income of the average worker showed literally no gain the income of the top hundredth of a percent went up almost 500 percent
3068180 to say that men and women should not inject their personal morality into public policy debates is a practical absurdity our law is by definition a codification of morality much of it grounded in the judeo christian tradition
3068181 when science teachers insist on keeping creationism or intelligent design out of their classrooms they are not asserting that scientific knowledge is superior to religious insight they are simply insisting that each path to knowledge involves different rules and that those rules are not interchangeable
3068182 in judging the persuasiveness of various moral claims we should be on the lookout for inconsistency in how such claims are applied
3068183 its useful to remind ourselves then that osama bin laden is not ho chi minh and that the threats facing the united states today are real multiple and potentially devastating our recent policies have made matters worse but if we pulled out of iraq tomorrow the united states would still be a target given its dominant position in the existing international order
3068184 that should mean growing the size of our armed forces to maintain reasonable rotation schedules keeping our troops properly equipped and training them in the language reconstruction intelligence gathering and peacekeeping skills theyll need to succeed in increasingly complex and difficult missions
3068185 the united states has the unilateral right to defend itself against an attack
3068186 we have the right to take unilateral military action to eliminate an imminent threat to our security so long as an imminent threat is understood to be a nation group or individual that is actively preparing to strike u s targets or allies with which the united states has mutual defense agreements and has or will have the means to do so in the immediate future
3068187 it will almost always be in our strategic interest to act multilaterally rather than unilaterally when we use force around the world by this i do not mean that the un security council a body that in its structure and rules too often appears frozen in a cold war era time warp should have a veto over our actions
3068188 the system of free markets and liberal democracy that now characterizes most of the developed world may be flawed it may all too often reflect the interests of the powerful over the powerless but that system is constantly subject to change and improvement and it is precisely in this openness to change that market based liberal democracies offer people around the world their best chance at a better life
3068189 i have little sympathy for those who would enlist the government in the task of enforcing sexual morality like most americans i consider decisions about sex marriage divorce and childbearing to be highly personal at the very core of our system of individual liberty where such personal decisions raise the prospect of significant harm to others as is true with child abuse incest bigamy domestic violence or failure to pay child support society has a right and duty to step in
3068190 the expectations and media exposure bring us unbearable pressure the smartest way to deal with that pressure is to transform it and use it to overcome
3068191 its a good thing without it you are unable to focus
3068192 hendrix was just a sweet guy to an extent he was murdered by the people around him because they didnt take care of him

3068194 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important
3068195 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
3068196 i must apologise again for deciding to come to live in england if i am fortunate enough i will return and die on thai soil just like other thais
3068197 any further deterioration in the outlook for global growth would represent a significant downside risk to the domestic activity profile particularly if it led to a marked slowing in growth in china and india
3068198 this could lead to a significant deterioration in the outlook for the australian economy and commodity markets
3068199 demand pressures in the economy now appear to be easing and the forecasts project a significant period of slower growth which will result in a moderation of capacity pressures as this occurs the pricing power of businesses is likely to fall
3068200 as required in order to promote sustainable growth consistent with the medium term inflation target of 2 to 3per cent
3068201 in a globalised economy we dont expect a smooth ride
3068202 this assessment reflects both an expectation of softer growth in asia and a general view that the problems in global financial markets are proving to be deeper and more persistent and will weigh on global growth outcomes for longer than had generally been expected
3068203 as growth slows in a number of regions of the world economy loan losses are likely to increase which could further weaken financial institutions hampering the provision of credit and potentially amplifying the economic slowdown
3068204 the ongoing turmoil in capital markets could exacerbate the slowing in domestic growth by further reducing the availability of credit to households and businesses
3068205 its the potential for new account fraud that arises when social security accounts are compromised
3068206 this guy obviously didnt do his homework he doesnt know the value of these on the black market
3068207 un almanaque es el mejor avi n para un pobre sosten a cada vez que yo le preguntaba si lamentaba no haber salido de su pa s evitaba esos temas elud a cualquier cercan a con sus sue os truncados
3068208 the beauty of the net framework has always been that it makes it easier for developers to build applications that are visually stunning well connected and highly secure
3068209 however we want to make sure we are keeping the end user experience in mind as well which is why we created the net framework client profile the net framework client profile significantly speeds up the installation of windows and enables a much more consumer friendly experience this is a huge step forward for the more than 4 million net developers worldwide
3068210 s lo puedo mostrarte el p rtico eres tu quien debe atravesarlo
3068211 only 5 to 10 of all criminal cases involve biological evidence that could be subjected to dna testing
3068212 i always want the defendant to have the best representation possible and professor moran provides that to his clients
3068213 we are looking for new evidence and we have to show why that evidence that wasnt presented the first time and why the new evidence is likely to result in an acquittal
3068214 the case we take will tend to be big and sprawling so well have to start slowly
3068215 our students will see the whole range from murder to fraud
3068216 they wanted me to walk out in the middle of the night
3068217 but i couldnt get a bus or anything at that hour
3068218 when something like this happens to you you have control issues
3068219 theyre going to come and kidnap me again and say oh we made a mistake we shouldnt have let you out
3068220 the best way we can get along now is to not talk but just do our separate lives and leave each other notes about where were going to go and when were going to get back
3068221 a lot of guys get out of prison and cant make it
3068222 when youre living in that environment around hundreds of people there was an energy and when you get out thats gone
3068223 for the first five years its a lot of anger and its like hell ok then at some point you start moving forward
3068224 i wanted to understand what my purpose was for instance why i was there
3068225 it was literally like they said get away from us
3068226 and somebody does something or says something or harasses him he just aint going to hear it anymore he just wants to be left alone
3068227 and when they put me around people like that it makes me nervous
3068228 going to college in the free world its about acting out having fun dating sleeping late partying a lot
3068229 delaying your gratification doing these things you need to do
3068230 im sad about the fact that i havent been able to make a life for myself
3068231 i think often times they look at the usual suspects
3068232 i think dalton jones was thinking this is a dangerous person and whether he did it or whether he didnt im going to get him off the street
3068233 reflect that lorden is unable to fairly and reliably describe the circumstances of the offense
3068234 weve got a serious problem here that goes beyond coughing up cases where snitches were helpful
3068235 the whole criminal justice system is being intimidated by the way this thing is being run and in many cases especially at the local level mishandled
3068236 we have the most data on capital and homicide convictions because they are the most high profile
3068237 so we have no idea how many wrongful convictions there are in larceny cases or assault cases or any other because nobody is paying any attention to those
3068238 the governments use of criminal informants is largely secretive unregulated and unaccountable
3068239 this lack of oversight and quality control leads to wrongful convictions more crime disrespect for the law and sometimes even official corruption
3068240 if the criminal system cant get homicide cases right then its very unlikely that were getting other things right
3068241 very few people will look at that kind of prison time and not cooperate
3068242 we have this incredible institution for cooperators and informants yet for the kind of cooperating we need the most there are really no resources
3068243 but you spend time with this guy you get to know him and his family you like him you believe that he has come clean hopefully the assistant has a skeptical mindset but the reality is that the cooperators information often becomes your mindset
3068244 sometimes prosecutors are convinced they have the guilty guy then they go about seeking to convict and do not carefully look at things that are funny about their case
3068245 most prosecutors are very very young especially at the state level
3068246 theyre new graduates of law school or theyve done some other job for a few years but theyre mostly in their late 20s early 30s tops with very little experience its one of the reasons that office policies that just tell them what to do are so important
3068247 the established safeguards of the anglo american legal system leave the veracity of a witness to be tested by cross examination and the credibility of his testimony to be determined by a properly instructed jury
3068248 lets say the government does disclose compensation and the jury knows about it
3068249 you would think and the supreme court certainly thinks that that will make a difference
3068250 the supreme court has held that while defendants who go to trial are entitled to impeachment material about their informants defendants who plead guilty are not
3068251 so that means that most defendants will never see the deal that the informant got
3068252 when we appropriately manage informants great cases ones that make our community safe are the result
3068253 when informants are improperly used the results can be devastating but without the ability to freely use informants law enforcement would have very few significant investigative successes
3068254 and it doesnt have to necessarily be a matter of legislation but it could be a matter of individual prosecutors offices adopting specific policies it can be a matter of local ordinances it can be case law where judges start to intervene its a slow process and as of yet there is no uniform informants act
3068255 given the prevalence of informant falsehoods in wrongful capital convictions such hearings should be mandatory in capital cases even where the defense intends to concede guilt and move directly to the sentencing phase
3068256 hey i care what you think please think of my car as an extension of my personality
3068257 do as much as you can in between keeping up with the kids and sleep when you cant go anymore
3068258 so to the cannabis photographers what are some cameras that will do my buds justice
3068259 to keep people and dogs at a safe distance and educating the public about the baby harbor seals
3068260 could this be considered one of the most impressive individual athletic performances ever
3068261 with everything at stake in elite and professional sport all of the big ticket items dangled in front of elite athletes i think its human nature that these guys want to get an edge
3068262 the tragedy is that we look for heroes and role models in sport we love these stories we need these stories we want our children to be inspired by these stories but now with whats happening and whats about to happen in baseball were about to see a complete paradigm shift in the overall perception and trust level of elite and professional athletes
3068263 no est descartada la posibilidad de volver a la armas
3068264 vamos a seguir luchando y eso nadie lo debe dudar
3068265 el frente polisario va a seguir defendiendo la legalidad internacional estamos dispuestos a seguir buscando la posibilidad de aplicar las resoluciones de las naciones unidas estamos dispuestos a apoyar al consejo de seguridad y al secretario general en la b squeda de una persona equilibrada que pueda realmente impulsar los acuerdos alcanzados para la realizaci n del referendo en el sahara occidental
3068266 vamos a seguir luchando y eso nadie lo debe dudar lucharemos en la forma que m s nos convenga en cada momento hist rico por la defensa de los derechos del pueblo saharaui y ello por supuesto que incluye el uso de las armas
3068267 es una posibilidad que no est descartada es una opci n que est sobre la mesa ahora bien siempre que podamos evitar un derramamiento de sangre lo evitaremos no obstante si vuelven a imponernos nuevamente la guerra como ya hicieron en 1975 el pueblo saharaui no s lo est decidido sino que est preparado para luchar y defender sus derechos en la forma que le sea posible con las armas en la mano si fuera necesario
3068268 sigue siendo la misma en el sahara ocupado no hay cambios la represi n policial contin a d a y noche siguen las vejaciones y las persecuciones a los ciudadanos saharuis se contin an realizando juicios sin ning n tipo de garant as procesales sigue existiendo miedo y la polic a secreta marroqu tiene pr cticamente tomadas todas las calles

3068281 die russen behaupten dass in s dossetien ber 2 000 friedliche einwohner get tet worden sind was k nnen sie dazu sagen
3068282 zchinwali ist eine winzige stadt noch vor all diesen ereignissen haben die russen einen gro teil der einwohner von dort evakuiert dort konnten gar nicht so viele menschen bleiben
3068283 aber euch wird vorgeworfen dass ihr die stadt beschossen habt und dass es opfer unter der bev lkerung gab
3068284 wir haben die stadt nicht beschossen wir mussten den beschuss beginnen als wir erfuhren dass russische panzer von norden her nach s dossetien vorr ckten zuvor hatte ich die einstellung des feuers verf gt wir hatten und haben nicht vor gegen jemanden krieg zu f hren als aber die russen in unser kleines und freiheitliebendes land eindrangen mussten wir uns verteidigen wir haben bereits 20 russische flugzeuge abgeschossen gegenw rtig haben sie eine seeblockade gegen georgien verh ngt und stoppen bereits schiffe mit humanit ren frachten eben erst ist ein schiff mit getreide f r die betroffene bev lkerung gestoppt worden gegen unser kleines land ist eine harte und unmenschliche aggression entfesselt worden
3068285 den georgischen pr sidenten michail saakaschwili k mmert das schicksal dieser menschen osseten am wenigsten am wichtigsten dagegen ist f r ihn dass sie auf dem georgischen territorium leben sonst h tte er in der nacht zum 8 august mit dem massiven artilleriefeuer auf die winzige stadt zchinwali nicht begonnen in der es keine milit rischen ziele gibt und deren einwohner wie die georgier selbst sagen und das darf nicht vergessen werden georgische b rger sind es handelt sich um einen eklatanten versto gegen das internationale humanit re recht saakaschwili ist f r seinen zick zack kurs zwischen kampflust und friedensliebe demokratischen und autokratischen neigungen bekannt bei mehreren gelegenheiten musste er buchst blich vom rande eines abgrunds weggesto en werden diesmal hat er die grenze berquert
3068286 over one lakh bangladeshis who entered india with valid passports and visa are traceless as on date
3068287 the seat of power in bangladesh is occupied by elements who comes from different streams of thoughts this makes it further difficult to deal with the problem
3068288 dar liquidez es una manera de evitar el colapso del sistema financiero y eso hay que aplaudirlo
3068289 hasta ahora el gobierno est haciendo lo posible por amortiguar el golpe pero hay riesgos quiz s el mayor sea la inflaci n sobre todo alzas en los energ ticos y en los alimentos porque eso puede hacer cambiar la postura de la reserva federal y obligarlo a subir la tasa de inter s lo cual prolongar a y profundizar a el receso
3068290 la reserva federal tendr la autoridad para acceder a todo el sistema donde considere necesario
3068291 casi todas las cifras indican que la econom a de estados unidos est cayendo en recesi n ya hubo p rdida de 22 000 empleos en enero y 63 000 en febrero la esperanza sin embargo es que la recesi n sea breve y que sea leve las ltimas dos recesiones en estados unidos 1990 y 2001 duraron un promedio de ocho meses
3068292 hay algunos que defienden la teor a del decoupling diciendo que la recesi n estadounidense no afectar a econom as emergentes como china o la india yo sin embargo soy m s partidario del efecto domin si ee uu deja de ser consumidor las dem s naciones lo van a sentir
3068293 una econom a estadounidense debilitada especialmente en los mercados de consumo tiene capacidad para impactar sobre nuestro socios comerciales
3068294 estamos pensando en una recesi n suave en estados unidos creemos que va a haber una desaceleraci n en europa y tambi n alg n impacto en china en ese contexto estamos previendo que va a haber un impacto en la regi n pero relativamente menor
3068295 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spinoff
3068296 she thought she deserved parity and shes got a point
3068297 the owner of one of the coolest stores in beverly hills a shopping hot spot that is frequented
3068298 in some way every show that followed 90210 was a remake of 90210
3068299 for the fans sake i am really happy for them
3068300 some of them he finds really cute and he keeps them and they stay and stay and stay
3068301 your principles mean more to you than any money or success
3068302 he played a big part in putting it all together
3068303 at tea break le duc tho mentioned that drv had intended to release admiral mccains son as one of the three pilots freed recently but he had refused
3068304 you are a great american a national treasure and i am glad to say my good friend
3068305 to barack i love your audacity with great respect and warmest wishes
3068306 its really important to honor peoples style and their personal relationships
3068307 you cant just pick a thing put it there and say its feng shui
3068308 i got a feeling that he wasnt really as available as he could be
3068309 he may not be getting the advantage of all the opportunities that he might if he unbarricaded them
3068310 its an uncomplicated image what you see is what you get
3068311 sometimes that can create a situation where youre not as supported by the people in the office with you
3068312 well maybe after 9 11 but as soon as that happened we were expecting a rush this came totally out of the blue its scary
3068313 they say on the tv that this has nothing to do with us but you just cant trust those russians
3068314 i remember when they invaded colorado in the eighties those reds theyre good for nothing you cant trust them no further than you can throw them
3068315 we have to be alert and aware at all times and our forces are ready to act at a moments notice i have the national guard on speed dial i can tell you i very nearly made that call today
3068316 cnn monitors all news stories we become aware of and report according to what we deem as relevant we have all the information anyone could need on the situation in georgia the country of georgia that is cnn is the world news leader
3068317 we were overwhelmed with calls for a while there and we are still getting a few said official drew ossington
3068318 we did contact washington and from what we were told the president was informed of the situation
3068319 i think its important for people to remain aware and alert
3068320 fear is a good thing it keeps us on edge and ready for anything this may have been a false alarm but the next one might not be im very happy that our residents are so proactive
3068321 were just beginning to see where this will lead but it marks an overall shift in how things are going to be done in the mobile environment
3068322 egypt is attacking the tunnels on its border with the gaza strip because of the great american and israeli pressure it faces
3068323 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3068324 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers
3068325 this is very bad news for romania it sends a clear message that whoever starts investigating big files will end up like this
3068326 we are interested in having an institution capable of meeting its targets
3068327 for example anything over three years old should automatically be deleted 100
3068328 ive decided that everything that i need to survive the rest of my journey here on earth is here in my home
3068329 students cant learn and teachers cant teach in classrooms where kids are disruptive some teachers are afraid to restore order when needed because they fear legal harassment its unacceptable that a teacher would have that hesitation
3068330 ultimately we need parents to recognize that firm school discipline is in every childs interest and support teachers in doing whatever is necessary to maintain it but for now we need action to see that no students education is damaged by the bad behavior of anyone around him
3068331 destruyendo hasta la ltima oficina del gobierno de hamas y acabando hasta con el ltimo activista controlar amos a otra pueblo en contra de su voluntad
3068332 court decisions that can be purchased and destroyed by those with the money to do so
3068333 simply provide more profits for the international oil cartel by placing the oil on the open market and does nothing to address the enormous tax burden the state and federal governments have placed on gasoline
3068334 the strategic reserve contains american oil already bought and paid for by the american people
3068335 it was created to provide petroleum for our military in the event of a national emergency and temporary relief from economic and natural disasters
3068336 americans freezing in their homes this winter would certainly be a disaster brought on by economic conditions that are directly traceable to inaction by congress but that is our oil and it should be made available to the states so it could go directly to americans who would use it to heat their homes
3068337 we need to drill our way out of this for the near future as we combine clean and safe drilling with clean and safe nuclear and a concerted effort to replace fossil fuels with alternative energy sources
3068338 the strategic petroleum reserve the oil in anwr off the u s coast and in the rockies is american oil on american soil
3068339 we the people still defines our form of government in america the people are the government and this oil is ours
3068340 keep american oil in america where it would directly benefit americans
3068341 this is the emergency we planned for when american taxpayers bought that oil
3068342 why should it go on the market where international speculators can manipulate the price for their profits
3068343 each lease approved by the government should have a provision to deposit a portion of all oil pumped from those areas into the strategic reserve until america has made the transition to alternative non fossil fuels
3068344 in essence the strategic reserve would kept full by those sources of oil and if expanded would give america a real buffer against natural or man made disasters
3068345 if john larson doesnt know where the money would come from for his own plan he is delusional at best if he thinks it will be in any form other than tax and fee increases
3068346 we believe asps average selling prices remained strong in 2q08 despite demand uncertainty as a result of 09 legislative concerns we believe estimates for jaso remain low based on si procurement levels and scheduled capacity ramp early 09 asp negotiations seem to be progressing wel l for jaso at down 5 10 this is in line to slightly better than we have been modeling giving us further confidence in our 09 revenue estimates we believe that jasos balance sheet entering a period of legislative uncertainty is a significant advantage versus peers following its recent 400m convert we believe that all poly shipments are currently on schedule after some internal poly production delays at shunda earlier in 2008 covered by m setek supply we expect management to increase fy08 shipment and revenue guidance given poly procurement levels and scheduled capacity ramp
3068347 we had a long night negotiating on some little hurdles and i thought i should raise my fist but he mbeki remained cool and said let us continue talking
3068348 the major hold up is the refusal by mugabe to cede his executive powers he is only agreeing to a nominal prime minister post for morgan tsvangirai
3068349 they zanu pf are also insisting that mutambara becomes one of the deputy prime ministers obviously that is not acceptable to us
3068350 sometimes the arrest was blocked personally by chirac another time it was clinton

3068353 it makes our smart creative audience full partners in salons publishing future
3068354 its a convergence of more and harder training older athletes training for longer more technology and more people
3068355 you hear about doping today but in the old days training was considered unethical and people who were manual labourers were banned from competition
3068356 now you see more and more people participating for longer because the media and commercial footprint of amateur sport is so much greater and there is so much more of an opportunity for people making a living doing this
3068357 its going to be canadian its going to be canada
3068358 we certainly want to be able to accomplish for canada what i think the opening ceremonies accomplished for china
3068359 id like every canadian to be inspired by the opening to the 2010 winter olympic and paralympic games id like the world to feel they know a little bit more about canada as the opening ceremonies close
3068360 its canadas olympics its canadas opportunity to remind the world of what were going to be in the 21st century
3068361 the opening ceremonies that have been the most successful are the ones that either define or redefine the culture in way that brings pride to the national audience and a greater understanding of the essential elements of the culture of the host country to the global audience
3068362 literally thousands and thousands of people are volunteering here they are incredibly hospitable they want to help everybody in every way they can they just couldnt be better representatives of china
3068363 i was here in may the difference between transportation now and then is just like night and day its amazing the way they transformed the city
3068364 we take both the athlete and the national olympic committee at their word on this
3068365 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do
3068366 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3068367 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3068368 they were able to develop such a loyal fan base
3068369 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humour they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3068370 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3068371 i think its important to show what kids really use
3068372 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
3068373 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
3068374 the outlook particularly with malaysia with regard to the lack of conservation efforts is not good at all
3068375 of course there are maybe one or two but it is getting less now
3068376 i think its a big problem because traditions are protected in these countries in south east asia its very difficult to find alternatives which have the same value as a turtle egg
3068377 we have to have the soft approach because we cannot offend the local elders here

3068390 im not in the mood for this game today what else can i play
3068391 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3068396 teddy is a sweet lad with wit and gags at his fingertips
3068397 teddy is a sweet lad with wit and gags at his fingertips and a painful bitter story of unrequited infatuation to tell reliving a fairly horrible period of rejection it is sometimes excruciating to listen to and though the laughs are there they are too often buried in this over intimate description of his own hurt teddy is self deprecating to a fault his delivery lacks confidence and his very presence feels like an act of bravery he has come to open his soul which is not always a fun evening even if there is a liberal sprinkling of good gags when he finally gets to his single sexual encounter with the object of his desires the audiences sympathies are firmly with him were that not the case what follows would be tortuous listening no wonder he gives the impression he has undertaken a very brave thing here his obvious unease on stage does nothing to soothe the awkwardness in the material that is just never going to be easy to hear this is not the sort of thing youd want to subject yourself to if you were feeling a bit low but teddy is an endearing funny young man when he finally gets over this woman and finds something else to talk about hell be worth seeing
3068398 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3068399 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3068400 vivid red yellow and blue case topped with a small army of minifigs and maybe a pirate ship

3068403 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3068404 my team and i think there are some great dedicated mobile email devices out there but were biased because half of us helped build one of them unfortunately the rest of the worlds 1 1 billion email users have phones with unusable hard to configure in built email that few people can be bothered to set up with bluewhalemail weve gone back to the drawing board so that people can keep the phone they like and still stay in touch on the go
3068405 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3068406 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3068407 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3068408 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3068409 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3068410 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3068415 disorder and diffusion crop up all the time and are mainly a nuisance
3068416 but by understanding them we can maybe use them to our advantage
3068417 so when i put my hand on the bible i will swear to not only uphold the laws of our land i will swear to uphold the honor and dignity of the office to which i have been elected so help me god
3068418 the take home message seems to be that the most glaring problems like bombing might not be as serious in the long term as the quiet or silent problems like runoff and development
3068419 searching online is more efficient and following hyperlinks quickly puts researchers in touch with prevailing opinion but this may accelerate consensus and narrow the range of findings and ideas built upon
3068420 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3068421 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

3068429 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3068430 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3068431 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3068432 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3068433 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3068434 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3068435 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3068436 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3068437 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3068438 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3068439 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3068440 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3068441 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3068442 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3068443 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3068446 zorn hasnt even called plays before there is no reason to assume hes ready for this
3068447 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3068448 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3068449 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3068450 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3068451 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

3068455 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3068456 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3068457 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3068458 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3068459 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3068460 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3068461 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3068462 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3068463 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3068464 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3068465 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3068466 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3068467 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3068468 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3068469 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3068470 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3068471 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3068472 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3068473 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3068474 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3068475 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3068476 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3068480 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3068481 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3068482 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3068483 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3068484 we dont offer collocation services ourselves we provide software that is optimized for collocation
3068485 collocation is something were exploring its not something were doing yet
3068486 were able to pull in market data at a very high speed from bats so that clients can execute off of it
3068487 one thousandth of a second will cost slippage and cause them to lose money were talking microsecond latency for these applications to work
3068488 the advantage is that since an exchange has a different format for its data if you are trading on nyse and now want to use the same application on nasdaq youd have to rewrite your applications
3068489 even though the application is the same the way it gets market data from each exchange is very different
3068490 we do it without adding additional latency to their trading application there has to be some but were very competitive
3068491 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3068492 and if theres any kind of debris that can be ingested into the engines we didnt want to expose the airplanes to that

3068499 if mike pelfrey has hit a wall then the mets are in trouble
3068500 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3068501 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3068502 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3068503 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia

3068552 we no longer know the limits of the invading russian army russia seems intent on overthrowing the democratically elected government of georgia and occupying the country

3068606 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3068607 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3068608 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3068609 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3068610 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3068611 the big stores put him out of time period business

3068618 john had to do his penance to his girlfriend by singing dreaming with a broken heart
3068619 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3068620 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3068621 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3068627 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
3068628 public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily
3068629 it is time to tighten the bail laws and put public safety first
3068630 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve
3068631 enforcement action is one part of the solution and that is why i am today calling on our partners in the police and trading standards to get tough with anyone illegally selling knives to under 18s
3068632 i want to see more test purchasing operations like those being undertaken in birmingham to catch any unscrupulous retailers
3068633 clearly our aim is to make sure seats are filled
3068634 but there are rules that the international olympic committee set about ticket pricing
3068635 we have got to look at how we apply those rules in practice to minimise the serried rows of empty seats
3068636 the birds nest stadium is probably the last iconic olympics stadium
3068637 why because its capacity is a bit over 85 000 in the uk we have an 85 000 seater stadium more than and its our national stadium wembley
3068638 we need to create an environment in schools that reflects the importance of science and the value of studying it we also need to send an unambiguous message to young people who are good at science that science as a career can be fascinating and worthwhile and will reward you well
3068639 the question is whether our fellow citizens will do more than just pour concrete
3068640 what russia has done here is used massive and disproportionate force
3068641 its breached international law and it has violated georgias territorial integrity
3068642 it has acted as a massive and dangerous bully and we cant allow this to go ahead without it being challenged
3068643 i think georgia should be able to join nato and the timetable if anything should be accelerated
3068644 so it is deplorable russian military aggression there that we have on the ground
3068645 the british prime minister and british foreign secretary are working very hard in the international arena
3068646 russia is going way beyond these disputed territories and is in danger of destabilising further parts of the region if this type of activity continues
3068647 if ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart to give glory unto my name saith the lord of hosts i will even send a curse upon you and i will curse your blessings yea i have cursed them already because ye do not lay it to heart behold i will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your faces even the dung of your solemn feasts and one shall take you away with it

3068969 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3068970 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3068971 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3068972 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3069017 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
3069018 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
3069019 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
3069020 there must be susceptibility factors in the granule neuron precursor cell that predispose it to forming cancer so we now must try to understand what it is about this cell type that makes it susceptible to forming cancer in response to sonic hedgehog signaling this relationship between stem cells and oncogenes suggests a new point of potential therapeutic intervention

3069024 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3069025 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia
3069026 the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3069027 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3069028 continued aggression against georgia and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond south ossetia will only serve to damage russias international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe
3069029 peaceful and speedy resolution to this crisis which maintains georgias territorial and political integrity
3069030 in georgia overall everything that has to do with domestic demand has huge potential
3069031 however as the stock market is not that developed for bigger investors it is either bank of georgia and a couple of other stocks or private equity investments
3069032 the stock is cheap but not at a distressed level yet
3069033 should the conflict continue in georgia bank of georgia might find it difficult to refinance its loans at reasonable rates
3069034 foreign investors have been net sellers of emerging europe equities since 2006 but have been net buyers of bonds due to the increased carry trade
3069035 as risk perception has increased that might also bring along outflows from eastern european fixed income instruments

3069037 saakashvili promoted himself as the georgian modernizer he gave a clear direction to his country to join nato the eu and escape russian influence and to try to increase economic growth he was the modernizer but he will now also be the war maker to some extent
3069038 this war has pushed georgia further away not just from europe but also complicates the nato council in december
3069039 italy maintains that we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe and on this point we are close to russian prime minister vladimir putins position

3069280 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3069281 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking

3069287 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3069288 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3069289 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

3069292 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3069293 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3069294 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3069295 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3069296 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

3069300 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
3069301 to lynn this is probably the equivalent of bulldozing the local church and replacing it with a porn shop what happened to family values is that man in the strip wearing an apron wont the wife have an affair with a guy from work
3069302 i thought they were supposed to stay with their own kind
3069303 i have a nasty suspicion that youre at least half right and theyre here to bestow a traditional native blessing on the noble white folk who were so kind as to befriend them
3069304 i read this strip as lynn thinking addressing criticisms that liz has no friends and mtigiwigi meant nothing to her check
3069305 isnt nice that the crows have come all the way from northwest ontario to make sure that liz is marrying a boy from her own culture
3069306 i have a horrible sinking feeling that lj will be unable to rise above her own pettyness and will tell us at some point this week that paul and susan have broken up because paul could not stop obsessing over liz and paul lost his job as a police officer due to his newfound love of alcohol and hes overweight and a smoker now etc etc etc i hope to god lynn does not assassinate paul further with a throwaway strip or even panel with this totally unnecessary information but i suspect she will because shes a nasty shrewish harpy who must use every device to show us how superawesomeamazing anthony is compared to every other male in existence except michael
3069307 i hope youre right but im afraid theres a reason for lynn suddenly thrusting mtigians at us like this other than simply to show us how beloved liz still is up north
3069308 please note that the name crane is a cr word and is also the name of a bird it will be important later in the background an asian woman looks over her shoulder in fear of some man with large ears what this has to do with the plotline i dont know
3069309 theres no way they can actually provide any meaningful assistance to the main plot given that liz has classified her time up north as a huge immature mistake but neither can they be left off the guest list because among other things that would leave lynn open to charges of being less than progressive
3069310 the swiss are a very knowledgable and demanding customer and this very extensive flight and ground evaluation will really put us to the test consequently i am convinced that this is an excellent opportunity for us to demonstrate to the swiss authorities the real and proven qualities of the gripen fighter
3069311 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3069312 ba and aa will argue that their alliance is now acceptable because the competitive environment has changed with the open skies accord on uk us routes this is a complete red herring open skies which is only a temporary accord as it may be unwound in 2010 has not significantly increased competition on uk london us routes
3069313 neither is the current economic slowdown a justification for waiving through any application the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal with
3069314 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travelers
3069315 we now have a similar situation at new york airports with government imposed restrictions the heathrow new york jfk route is by far the most important transatlantic market accounting for over 25 of the total heathrow us market

3069323 perfect sex on the island consists of five minutes of foreplay followed by 15 to 20 minutes of energetic thrusting with active female participation the females final orgasm should coincide with the mans the typical 18 year old mangaian couple make love three times a night every night until their 30s when the weekly average drops to a mere 14

3069325 the future vision for the library service in belfast is available on our website
3069326 we hope our demonstrations at ardoyne and ballymacarrett will create a greater awareness to library users of these closure plans and we encourage members of the public to attend our demonstrations
3069327 while we recognise the difficult financial position of library services at present we are opposed to these proposals as they remove services from some of the most socially deprived areas in belfast

3069420 there were loyalty oaths for teachers as well as city employees says rebecca shoemaker an indiana state university professor of u s history and author of an as yet unpublished book about the first 40 years of the iclu
3069421 there was an investigation at the state level to find communists working for the state she says

3069440 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3069441 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3069442 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3069443 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3069444 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3069445 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3069446 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3069447 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3069448 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3069449 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3069450 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3069451 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3069452 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3069453 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3069454 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3069455 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3069456 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3069457 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3069458 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

3069460 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3069461 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3069462 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3069463 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3069464 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3069465 tierra que la forestales las adquirieron bajo leyes de la dictadura de pinochet a costa de negarle el derechos hist rico sobre la tierra a las comunidades mapuche
3069466 valorar lo alcanzado producto una lucha que muchos han pagados con c rceles y condena inesperada pero que nada es en vano por que la unidad de todas la luchas sociales en alg n momento de nuestra historia derrotara al sistema opresor neoliberal y pasada las elecciones municipales de octubre viviremos un chile distinto y nosotros la izquierda lo mapuche seguiremos avanzando en un proyecto de sociedad que contemple definitivamente nuestro territorio y autonom a

3069470 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

3069490 hope in other words is necessary to bring about change but it is never enough change also requires effective leadership inside government
3069491 in recent weeks some of the presidential candidates and their surrogates have been evoking history more insistently than ever not surprisingly those evocations often have been flimsy and faulty
3069492 the latest maiming of the historical record and elementary historical logic has come over martin luther king jr
3069493 ben smith of politico was among the first to stir things up charging that remarks by clinton on mlk and lbj offered
3069494 we have to be very very careful about how we speak about that era in american politics
3069495 hope in other words is necessary to bring about change but it is never enough change also requires effective leadership inside government its not a matter of either or that is either king or johnson but a matter of both and
3069496 behind this argument over clintons comments lies a false mythic view of the 1960s in which the civil rights movement supposedly pushed johnson and the democrats to support civil rights against their own will in fact the movement and the elected officials were distinct but complementary elements in the civil rights politics that changed america
3069497 that it would make other legislation impossible and he knew how much was riding on it politically and historically he knew all of that
3069498 picking up the murdered kennedys mantle johnson used his mastery of congressional politics to push through the momentous civil rights act in 1964
3069499 the more profound stage of the battle for civil rights
3069500 that after a century a southern white president would help lead the way toward the salvation of the negro
3069501 martin luther king led the movement lyndon b johnson supported that movement played the politics guided the legislation and signed it into law both were indispensable to the civil rights successes of the 1960s to acknowledge both denigrates neither man describing such an acknowledgement as a denigration of dr king is at best bad history at worst it is a manipulative and inflammatory racial appeal concerning a crucial era in american history an era that needs very very careful consideration indeed either way the current heated rhetoric demonstrates that the utopia of post racial politics has hardly arrived
3069502 t he more grievous grievous abuses of history though have come from the democrats and particularly from the barack obama side including his many avid supporters in the media and the academy
3069503 this record is not comparable to obamas eight years in the illinois legislature his work as a community organizer and his single election to the senate in 2004 an election he won against a late entrant right wing republican alan keyes in a state where the gop was in severe disarray
3069504 the lincoln comparison is equally tortured yes lincoln spent only two years in the house after winning election in 1846 yet his deep involvement in state and national politics began in 1832 the same year he was elected a captain in the illinois militia and 28 years before he ran for president he then served as leader of the illinois whig party and served his far from undistinguished term in congress courageously leading opposition to the mexican war
3069505 after returning home he became one of the leading railroad lawyers in the country emerged as an outspoken antislavery leader of illinois republican party and then in 1858 ran unsuccessfully for the senate and engaged with stephen a douglas in the nations most important debates over slavery before the civil war it behooves the champions of any candidate to think carefully when citing similarities to lincolns record in this case the comparison is absurd
3069506 like our father hillary has devoted her life to embracing and including those on the bottom rung of societys ladder
3069507 by the time he ran for president jfk had served three terms in the house and twice won election to the senate before that he was of course a decorated veteran of world war ii having fought with valor in the south pacific
3069508 every now and then in american politics normally balanced people get swept up by delusions of greatness about a presidential candidate based on an emotional attachment to the candidates oratory or image
3069509 political journalists have never been immune to the delusional style but editorialists and pundits are supposed to be skeptical experts
3069510 i n fact nothing more than enthusiasm based on feelings and projections that are unattached to verifiable rational explanation or the public record
3069511 bush had a thin record on domestic matters as governor of texas no record whatsoever on foreign policy and things to hide about his past none of it mattered
3069512 the pundits have vaunted good vibes and gut thinking as the crucial qualifications for the nations highest office they have turned the delusional style into a rallying cry in support at least for the moment of the candidacy of barack obama and his allegedly superior intuition
3069513 there are many possible explanations for this latest outbreak of the delusional style
3069514 the old and long discredited right wing bromides repackaged as the
3069515 historians cannot expect all politicians and their supporters to know as much about american history as say john f kennedy who won the pulitzer prize for a work of history but it is reasonable to expect respect for the basic facts and not contribute to cheapening the historical currency

3069523 as the global trend in energy is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase fuel efficiency fuel cells are bound to be an important industry in the future as they can be combined with clean coal technologies to produce efficient and green energy
3069524 as fuel cells are showing a lot of promise for powering energy demanding devices the us government has made its research and development a flagship project
3069525 this means that the thermal byproduct of solid oxide fuel cells can be used to increase their fuel efficiency
3069526 to give people an idea of fuel efficiencies today car engines currently have about 10 percent to 17 percent fuel to electric efficiency
3069527 the cells that we have produced can generate 500mw of electricity per square centimeter under operating conditions of 800 c when the cell units are stacked more powerful systems can be created this year we successfully created a 1kw system at the institute with a goal of manufacturing 1kw to 5 kw units for residential or retail storefront applications by 2010
3069528 the government plays an important role in fuel cell development as if subsidies are given research in the field would be more rapidly conducted and commercial sales of the units would be more accepted which in turn would bring the cost of the batteries down and promote better and better models to be made

3069538 ive had my bowflex for almost 2 years now i saw results immediately after i started using it ive lost over 30 pounds and have dropped from a size 14 to a size 4 without having to watch what i eat i have more energy
3069539 women then showed that they are a power to be reckoned with and that if united women can achieve results
3069540 it is unfair that taiwanese women are not included in the convention but they should not be paralyzed by the politics
3069541 some people are changing their way of interacting with their pets and are beginning to treat them like family
3069542 originally sean was only hosting stray dogs in his own apartment in taipei until he got evicted from his residence
3069543 originally a guy named eric started the shelter with me but he quit after a month while 10 people showed up for the first monthly organization meeting all of them quit within weeks
3069544 we pull in about nt 200 000 a month which just breaks us even since our basic expenditures including salary for three local full time staff and rent is around nt 160 000 per month depending on the number of animals in the shelter we also need nt 20 000 to nt 30 000 for food
3069545 unlike some animal shelters we dont kill our animals except on very rare occasions
3069546 lazarus the name of a man in the bible who was raised from the dead by jesus was a complete mess when we found him you can see pictures of him on our web site animalstaiwan org rescues htm but by the time he got out and found an owner he was happy energetic and loving
3069547 even for animals that are blind or have only two legs as long as there is life in their eyes we would give them a try because it is not our job to take away their desire to live we have always been amazed by their recoveries
3069548 some people too freely dump their dogs because the puppies turned into dogs and are not cute anymore or because their pets behave badly or because it is not convenient for them to keep dogs anymore
3069549 which is just like dumping dogs out of the owners own stupidity and ignorance because no dog would behave without proper training and training them is the responsibility of the owners
3069550 you dont see caged animals as much some people are changing their way of interacting with their pets and are beginning to treat them like family if anything some people are starting to baby their dogs which may not necessarily be a good thing if it is too extreme
3069551 there is always going to be stray or mistreated dogs
3069552 one of future key focuses of at will be to run an educational program that teaches the public compassion for animals as well as how to care for and train them
3069553 as an ngo we can now apply for governmental funding receive money from international charities as well as get corporate sponsorship
3069554 i have always liked and felt dedicated to animals and i want to see a change in taiwan
3069555 whenever you feel like quitting it is a test of whether you are going to succeed in your pursuit or not those that give up do not succeed
3069556 the potential for further cooperation between the two countries is huge
3069557 i asked to come here because i thought it would be the right moment to be in taiwan
3069558 it was just some months ahead of the legislative and the presidential elections the mood was already that the taiwanese political scene was about to have some historic changes but what we could not have imagined was the dimension of the change
3069559 it was the voters that wanted the change and they got it
3069560 at the time i could not have imagined that i would come back to taiwan as the representative
3069561 my wife and i have traveled to reside in england
3069562 if i still have luck i would come back and die on thai soil like every other thai person
3069563 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
3069564 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
3069565 i thought i would be able to prove my innocence and receive justice which is why i returned to thailand on feb 28 but the situation has deteriorated
3069566 i have also constantly received news that my life is not safe wherever i travel i have to use bulletproof cars this is the result i got from volunteering to serve the country the king and the people
3069567 we cant get e mail until october after the olympics
3069568 we wouldnt be able to go and watch them as the train station will not sell us any train tickets so i dont really care
3069569 the slogan is now about a safe olympics and of course in the chinese way of doing things they impose more restrictions
3069570 and even if they are just buddhist monks religious forces are always regarded by the chinese government as one of the political threats to the regime
3069571 they always come to ask us where have you been and who have you talked to
3069572 people say things will get better after the olympics but im not so sure
3069573 fighting between government troops and a breakaway group of the milf will not disrupt the ongoing peace process
3069574 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
3069575 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
3069576 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3069577 there certainly is a level of isi inter services intelligence complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organizations such as the taliban
3069578 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
3069579 the taliban launched a big attack on tor ghundi fort and iskandro post security forces responded and 20 militants were killed
3069580 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
3069581 we have asked officially but so far we have had no response
3069582 reinforcing iranian egyptian relations and bringing closer together the different islamic confessions especially sunnis and shiites
3069583 teach their children the sunnism thats taught at al azhar because it is moderate and open and this is message all over the world
3069584 a very smart move iran keeps reaching out to egypt and mubaraks egypt is not responsive and has not been for the past 10 years its political its not even diplomatic because i dont think it will be approved by the state
3069585 the general feeling at the moment is that we muslims are the target of destruction so we should do whatever is necessary to restore unity
3069586 we left this morning and four women were going to the doctor and one was going shopping in al wajhiyah before we reached the al wajhiyah the bomb exploded
3069587 through a common friend general durrani i had advised president musharraf to resign two months back but the president gave no reply
3069588 i think that s the important bit it s all well and good me saying no that i m not going after playing for a long time but it d be unfair to put a daniel flynn or a tim southee in that position
3069589 for me personally i want to make sure that it s a collective decision and not put in front of young guys because the young guys probably don t have the same options as the more experienced players
3069590 i know that they ll put players safety concerns first before they make a decision about turning up to the tournament
3069591 i was only there for a short period of time but i really enjoyed his coaching style
3069592 he s a guy who had a good knowledge of the game obviously it was only twenty20 but he s been successful with victoria and he had success with delhi
3069593 he s got a pretty simplistic style but it was one that i enjoyed while i was there he ll be one of the guys that new zealand cricket will have a good look at
3069594 i m pretty sure he hasn t applied but things can change with wrighty so we ll wait and see
3069595 for sudan practically now we are like in south africa in the 1990s
3069596 the virus is not that clever we can overcome but it works on our ignorance both political ignorance economic ignorance and personal ignorance
3069597 we never put any money in the collecting box when we went in over the fence all those years ago so we were a bit worried about owning up
3069598 mahmoud doesnt just belong to a family or a town but to all the palestinians and he should be buried in a place where all palestinians can come and visit him
3069599 with the death of darwish palestinian literature lost one of its pillars
3069600 obama started negative campaigning on john mccain long before we started punching back
3069601 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
3069602 obama started negative campaigning on john mccain long before we started punching back and i think a lot of our effort is really to get back into this game try and galvanize some of the public attention back onto this race make sure everybody understands theres two people in this race not just one and i think weve been successful in doing that
3069603 we are here to continue recovering natural resources and the consolidation of nationalization
3069604 melding together his roots as a president of south americas new left and at the same time a leader desperately in need of a formula for national unity
3069605 a critical threat to the vital interests of the united states in the next 10 years
3069606 the united states and japan should work together to limit the rise in chinese power in the years ahead
3069607 the best way to conduct our diplomacy and conduct our relations
3069608 is out of mutual respect and its much more likely a chinese leader will listen to my concerns if he knows i respect the people of china
3069609 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
3069610 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
3069611 china and the united states are not destined to be adversaries
3069612 dealing with a rising china will be a central challenge for the next american president
3069613 we must do all we can to guarantee that chinas rise is peaceful
3069614 trade with china stands at the center of these worries
3069615 chinas growing military power and the threat from north korea
3069616 wild parties consumption of illegal drugs and other unlawful activities had given the police barracks a very bad name this must stop
3069617 now we have cockroaches rats pigs dogs devils chickens and you name it it is a place for just about anybody to walk in and out and i intend to stop these kinds of unlawful and illegal movements in and out of police barracks

3069620 troops had killed 60 ltte liberation tigers of tamil eelam terrorists and 28 were wounded from sundays confrontations
3069621 but it was badly broken up after smashing through the forest canopy to the ground
3069622 we would have to achieve a truce and we would have to deal with the same parties as before
3069623 our objective is to reach not only our kurdish and arab citizens but also regional countries
3069624 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
3069625 we had a few quetzales guatemalan currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
3069626 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
3069627 my translator told me not to do it he said youll get shot but i just felt like the first step had to be made that day
3069628 pom354 this site has been acquired as an initiative of alternative livelihood
3069629 it was very odd as soon as i drank it i thought of the supermarkets in the uk and i knew i could turn it into something big
3069630 im in it to help solve a problem that i care about
3069631 there is a will in afghanistan to cultivate alternative livelihoods and rebuild pom354 is potentially the best alternative livelihood initiative to happen to afghanistan brett is the first person to come from the international community who talked to the people for the benefit of the people
3069632 before the match i didnt think i had a good chance andy had won in cincinnati last week
3069633 but i fought him from the first point to the end im proud of my country and of myself
3069634 i was at taipei airport when i heard the draw and i thought maybe i should take my luggage and go home but i am happy to be here i thought id try to do my best and learn something from andy and here i am now
3069635 i was really lucky to hold that game and when i did i thought i had a chance
3069636 andy was missing a lot of forehands and the next game i tried to play everything to his forehand and he began to miss
3069637 i went through a very low period in my life there was a period of five months when i stopped doing any training
3069638 we think this is a pretty serious threat and the government guys here weve been talking to agree
3069639 forget about picking and all that other stuff there is nothing abstract about making a plastic key for a lock that isnt yours
3069640 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
3069641 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
3069642 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
3069643 i was feeling not good my condition was not 100 percent but he was a good player today wong choong hann
3069644 im very happy they are the olympic champions so even when we had 20 points in the third game we could not take anything for granted it wasnt until we got that final point that we could celebrate
3069645 es el nico templo que hemos encontrado por el momento en zipori y ha sido una sorpresa porque siendo sta una ciudad jud a situada en una regi n jud a esper bamos encontrar sinagogas pero no hemos hallado todav a ninguna dentro de la ciudad y s este templo romano
3069646 el templo y su patio ocupan una rea muy grande en el centro de la ciudad es un espacio dominante
3069647 esperamos en un futuro tener m s informaci n sobre el culto encontrar alguna estatua o alg n resto que nos permita averiguar a qu dioses veneraban aqu
3069648 i was going to go to barnes and noble and chill but nothing really
3069649 did he ask me to go to his because he likes me
3069650 does he like me in a friend way or does he actually find me attractive
3069651 you want to go to some strangers house this late at night with his friends you dont even know hes 21 blahblahblah
3069652 if you ever want to hang out so long as i can be home before 11 let me know
3069653 we are in a tough pool and have to win every game so i am definitely happy to win this one
3069654 i cant be happy when we missed so many goals it is unacceptable at the start of the tournament we had seven penalty corners and wasted all of them it makes it difficult for us now but we will fight all the way
3069655 i am not surprised we had problems getting into the game at the start
3069656 we have a young team and for many of them it is their first olympics so a bit of nervousness was natural but once we settled down we just got better and better
3069657 no matter what wind i will always do my best
3069658 i had two really good races its a good start im really happy but its just the beginning and everything can change
3069659 we were happy with how they started but its very disappointing the rudder caught and jammed
3069660 we had a bit of a steering issue right from the start and after about 700m it got too hard to manage we veered into the lane beside us where the canadians were and we did a great job of not hitting them
3069661 i would like to thank my leader my coach as well as all who have helped me in the team without their help i would not be sat here
3069662 we already knew there would be many people cheering for us and the training for that certainly helped
3069663 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15m were incredible
3069664 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
3069665 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing i finished real strong
3069666 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
3069667 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3069668 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3069669 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
3069670 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
3069671 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
3069672 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3069673 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3069674 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
3069675 rock and roll hall of fame was pronounced dead at baptist memorial hospital memphis in memphis tenn after collapsing sunday afternoon near a treadmill in his home nearby
3069676 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3069677 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd
3069678 last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
3069679 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
3069680 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
3069681 i was just trying to concentrate on shooting i was not thinking about making history
3069682 for me life will go on all my life i have just been punching holes in a blank piece of paper target
3069683 but i sincerely hope this win will change the face of olympic sport in india in our country olympic sports are not really a priority i hope now they will get more attention
3069684 the test of the athlete revealed that she had tested positive for epo
3069685 moreno left china the evening of the test before she knew of the results
3069686 her accreditation has been cancelled and withdrawn by the ioc we have asked the sports governing body the international cycling union to follow it up as any disciplinary measures will be complete after the games finish
3069687 and its a spanish rider which shows that we have a problem in spain its time that spanish authorities start to do something concretely for years they have not been tough enough on doping and this is the result of their leniency
3069688 even so it should be made clear the organizers government and media are following protocol and calling taiwan by its proper name at the olympics chinese taipei
3069689 i have to first off all thank my little boy pietro who is waiting for me
3069690 i wished it was longer than eight minutes because it went so quickly
3069691 i wished to go again because it was so much fun
3069692 some of them he finds really cute and he keeps them and they stay and stay and stay
3069693 your principles mean more to you than any money or success
3069694 he played a big part in putting it all together
3069695 at tea break le duc tho mentioned that drv had intended to release admiral mccains son as one of the three pilots freed recently but he had refused
3069696 you are a great american a national treasure and i am glad to say my good friend
3069697 to barack i love your audacity with great respect and warmest wishes
3069698 when i started making putts i just stuck in there and it brought my game up the more i got into it the better i played
3069699 but the worst is over we expect to see better growth in the second half when some of our efforts will start to pay off
3069700 we expect to expand our market scale before the end of the year to meet the need for strategic deployment across the taiwan strait
3069701 the company will take advantage of improved cross strait ties and reach out to more customers in the hope of reaping a harvest next year
3069702 it will take longer time to gauge the impact of cross strait ties
3069703 when are you going to realize that americans are not smart and support horrible crap like motorola phones american idol and hummers
3069704 the cdma razr has the highest number of failed phones ever sold in the us
3069705 as the tv population in these emerging markets grows so will the demand for large scaled digital stb in the near future when markets mature in developed countries emerging markets will become new sources of growth for the worldwide stb market these emerging markets will thus be a major focus for stb makers
3069706 ive lost one of my best buddies and it is not easy to reckon with
3069707 i will miss him and his contribution to the entertainment world and to human kind
3069708 it was just cool as hell we had isaac hayes records hanging around its purely sonic it sounded so good it was just immediately a very cool track
3069709 i would say weve definitely got him to thank because had he not written that tune we wouldnt have sampled it and the basis of the music that you hear is his
3069710 he was an equal cornerstone to the evolution of hip hop whats come to be known as r amp b and urban music in general
3069711 so theres absolutely no doubt that isaac hayes will be truly missed and he was a very influential part of music as we hear it today
3069712 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3069713 after laying the groundwork for the memphis soul sound through his work with stax records his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon
3069714 the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present
3069715 the 2008 convention is about ensuring that those peoples voices are heard and their call for change is heeded

3069718 at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
3069719 stunned viewers thought they were watching the string of fireworks filmed from above by a helicopter
3069720 but in reality they were watching a 3 d graphics sequence that took almost a year to produce
3069721 inserted into the coverage electronically at exactly the right moment
3069722 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3069723 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished

3069726 is under significant pressure lately and is likely to remain so
3069727 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
3069728 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth
3069729 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk
3069730 new poll shows global warming hysteria fading in the united states
3069731 in light of rising inflation president chain store is emphasizing low to mid priced moon cakes below nt 600 per gift set
3069732 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
3069733 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
3069734 scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
3069735 the rba has continued to emphasize the importance of the slowdown in the domestic economy continuing they are looking for a long lasting downturn according to the statement

3069741 i believe it is going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all of the housing problems
3069742 were going to continue to have turmoil in our capital markets
3069743 the long term economic fundamentals of the united states compare very favorably
3069744 well we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
3069745 i think it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are important to our capital markets broadly
3069746 my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
3069747 we have a regulatory system that is very outdated it was put in place many years ago
3069748 the creation of a new marketplace is going to be a big step
3069749 but liquidity is a key to developing the right kind of trading marketplace
3069750 the japanese market should be globally competitive and transparent and the liquidity of its trading should grow
3069751 the market must be the place where participants are all able to easily join
3069752 we see significant potential to provide liquidity in the japanese carbon credit market and to help counterparties with managing their combined power fuel emissions weather cross commodity hedging and risk management
3069753 in the longer term the privatization will benefit companies and consumers
3069754 but president lee is starting the first phase of privatization with caution as he needs to consider the public opinion and his popularity

3069785 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3069786 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3069787 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3069788 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play you dont want to play around with teams if you have a chance to make a statement and put them away early you do that
3069789 it was the first time they werent doubling the post
3069790 anyone on this team could do it any given night
3069791 i dont feel the defeat today brings too much pressure
3069792 watching the game from the stands last night really motivated us
3069793 seeing lebron james block a shot with two hands off the backboard and just the way they were playing defense got us ready everyone came into this game knowing the crowd could be a factor
3069794 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3069795 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3069796 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
3069797 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
3069798 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
3069799 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
3069800 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
3069801 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
3069802 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
3069803 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
3069804 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
3069805 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children
3069806 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
