8730055 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8730056 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is

8730059 every game is a big game but thursday is a big chance for us to showcase nationally what we certainly hope to be about as a football program

8730061 i like to walk down paths nobody else wants to
8730062 people are just throwing names and number out there before anything has happened
8730063 before you even play a down of football you feel like you should be handed a trophy
8730064 i think being on both ends of the spectrum has really helped us stay grounded we know that we cant let that stuff get to us
8730065 with the expectations through the roof for this football team i think theres a little bit of pressure

8730070 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8730071 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that

8730073 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8730074 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
8730075 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing
8730076 its very difficult for governments that have had a specific regulation on their books for many years to suddenly decide to change
8730077 we think its very important to have a single set of requirements that can be enacted globally

8730209 barack obama the prospective democratic presidential candidate has managed to turn a 5 8 point lead over prospective republican opponent john mccain into a 7 point deficit a double digit slide in just two and a half months following a campaign that had voters really excited over his candidacy
8730210 how did he manage this feat which is documented in the latest latest reuters zogby poll
8730211 simple he followed the tried and true strategy of democratic centrist advisers who have increasingly dominated his campaign since the end of the primaries and who have a proven track record of producing democratic electoral disasters now for several decades
8730212 continue with the present losing strategy and we will see john mccain as president and the continuation of a weak compromised sell out democratic congress for at least the next four years
8730213 now as sympathetic as i am to the politics espoused by ralph nader and by the green party im well aware of the futility of third party campaigns even so count me as one progressive who at this point has stopped supporting obama
8730214 there is probably still time to turn this electoral debacle in the making around obama needs to come out unambiguously for a quick end to the war in iraq he needs to do an about face on his call for an expansion of the war in afghanistan he needs to flatly rule out preemptive war as a policy for the united states of america unless the country is in danger of imminent attack he needs to scotch plans for expanding the military and instead to start talking about how to reduce military spending so that those funds can be shifted to domestic priorities like improving education and dramatically increasing research into carbon free energy production he needs to call for a national healthcare system that will provide quality affordable medical care for all and he needs to call for an aggressive campaign to combat joblessness and to reduce income disparity within the us
8730215 gee i should start tacking right now no left no wait a minute maybe right
8730216 if obamas lead over mccain slips further or disappears altogether we can expect to hear some populist rhetoric from obama as we heard from john kerry as his disastrous bid for the presidency crashed and burned in 2004 but who will believe it now

8730258 a complac ncia da esquerda democr tica ser mesmo democr tico quem faz afirma es deste tipo pergunto eu para com a banalidade do mal a sua incapacidade de proclamar a possibilidade e a superioridade do bem tem conduzido a o crescimento da direita autorit ria por toda a europa o caso da it lia eloquente a viol ncia cresce impante nos bairros suburbanos e os mais pobres desistem de acreditar na solidariedade dos burgueses bem pensantes que lhes repetem que todos os cidad os mesmo os que roubam e sequestram e violam e aterrorizam s o inocentes at prova em contr rio os pobres tal como os pol cias que tamb m est o longe de ser ricos e protegidos pelo estado est o fartos de ser a in til e morta prova em contr rio

8730260 ningu m tem a capacidade de fazer julgamentos sum rios sem cometer erros por isso que a presun o de inoc ncia t o importante a presun o de inoc ncia garante que as certezas do acusador s o sempre confrontadas com as d vidas levantadas pela defesa

8730292 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
8730293 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
8730294 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans

8730324 simply put the secretary is not permitted to beg the ballot question or to manipulate voter preferences by emphasizing certain aspects of the revenue plan and by omitting less popular purposes

8730326 for the purpose of raising revenue for education of children in public schools pre kindergarten through grade 12 public school construction and improvements and construction of capital projects at community colleges and higher education institutions
8730327 for public education the horse racing industry and lottery operations with the remainder going to the licensees operators
8730328 thus we see that todays multicultural societies tolerate the explicitly intolerant and avowedly unicultural while refusing to tolerate anyone pointing out that intolerance

8730343 you just cant afford to view information security threats as a standalone duel against a virus or a phishing attack threats involve social engineering and technology trust and pervasive use today the effort to secure businesses personal identities and countries requires a greater level of coordination among parties that have not traditionally worked together as closely as theyll need to it security teams businesses government law enforcement consumers citizens theyre all targets yet theyre also allies the effectiveness of national enterprise and personal security will depend on the collaboration and communication among all of these constituencies

8730359 the x force security statistics report for 2006 predicted a continued rise in the sophistication of targeted profit motivated cyber attacks
8730360 this directly correlates to the rise in popularity of trojans that we are witnessing this year as trojans are often used by attackers to launch sustained targeted attacks
8730361 as more technologies and software get exposed to fuzzing and automated bug finding tools the industry begins to reach a saturation point in the discovery of these types of vulnerabilities ultimately contributing to the decrease in overall vulnerability disclosures
8730362 the decrease in spam message size and image based spam is a result of spammers adopting and experimenting with newer techniques such as pdf and excel based spam as a means to more successfully evade detection by anti spam technologies

8730364 joe will be a key member of digital resolves leadership team as his vast business experience spirit of entrepreneurship and credentials in the industry will be integral in helping us achieve our growth targets both domestically and abroad
8730365 we are privileged to have another industry leader on board to help us introduce digital resolves authentication and fraud detection solutions to strong new growth markets including e commerce and healthcare
8730366 until now the industry has approached two factor authentication in a non cost effective silo ed fashion that is not conducive to consumer adoption
8730367 verisign is making the investment to aggressively seed the market with credentials which puts the focus on a shared network to make it quick easy and inexpensive for organizations to provide two factor authentication to consumers
8730368 organizations with significant consumer franchises are under pressure to protect their users from identity theft and fraud and authentication networks like vip can help reduce these b2c risks
8730369 promotional programs like vip quick start speed time to value and make joining an authentication network a low risk proposition
8730370 symantec is honored to continue its world leading research efforts with the european community and leverage the unique expertise of its highly skilled and respected talent base
8730371 the combined efforts of our new symantec research lab and european commission project will help provide businesses and consumers the information and tools they need for greater confidence online
8730372 until recently it security has been looked at as defending the enterprise and a cost of doing business nothing more
8730373 in todays world where security is essential to trust and lack of trust can rapidly erode consumer partner and shareholder confidence the mindset is changing leading thinkers have discovered that real security relies on the conscious proactive development of trust and those that establish it not only address risk effectively they achieve business gain
8730374 digital trust surpasses efforts aimed at creating merely a feeling of trust by establishing a virtual handshake
8730375 this handshake helps establish trust and builds both confidence and relationship these aspects create preferred providers who get repeat business and referrals theyre also the most likely to retain your business in the wake of a security breach
8730376 adopting a digital trust strategy automatically gives you the benefits of the risk management approach
8730377 its a case of the best defense being a good offense and while the full strategic benefits are yet to be seen several of the companies described in the report are achieving return on investment the payoff potential is definitely there
8730378 government and industry regulations require companies to monitor and manage network traffic and events by adding log management services to their managed security services portfolio symantec seeks to address the increased demand for a more comprehensive and integrated set of security services that address challenges such as compliance requirements and risk management

8730382 symantecs solutions and experts provided invaluable insight and quantifiable evidence that our networks were more secure than in any prior cwid demonstration
8730383 countries around the world must secure their information and ensure compliance with government regulations while coping with a rapidly changing threat landscape
8730384 symantec enables governments to integrate network security monitoring operations threat vulnerability and patch management live updates and incident response in a powerful new way with these capabilities governments around the world can patch a big hole in their security risk profiles and proactively manage information and infrastructure threats instead of just reacting to them

8730403 we see no signs that the avalanche of junk email is abating
8730404 junk email was up dramatically in 2006 and has risen 24 just in the first 3 months of this year it administrators and users are grappling with a huge productivity issue where more than nine tenths of inbound emails are junk
8730405 it takes an average of 34 seconds to deal with each unwanted email that makes its way into a network
8730406 spam solutions need constant updating if they are to withstand the barrage of unproductive or dangerous email thats being generated by the malware economy
8730407 without a constantly updated threat management solution a firewall is subject to attack before you have even finished installing it
8730408 internet threats dont discriminate between the scale of the network they attack and we believe that everyone should have access to the best network protection we have therefore made our utm capabilities easily available to all our users through our range of totalsecure solutions
8730409 our totalsecure solutions are designed to simplify the selection between multiple point products and add on services by integrating everything you need to add utm protection to your network into a single affordable package

8730415 teens realize that in some ways they are more accessible when they are online
8730416 they try to strike a balance between being safe from strangers and keeping things private from their parents and other adults while at the same time sharing enough information that allows them to socialize with friends and perhaps even make new friends
8730417 social networking sites are not the first online application to spark worries among parents
8730418 in our first study of teen internet usage in 2000 well before social networking sites emerged many parents were worried that strangers would contact their children online through email and chat rooms at the time parents responded to these worries by taking precautions such as monitoring their childs internet use and placing the computer in a public area of the home much as they do today
8730419 while the web has become indispensable for knowledge information and commerce its also been a breeding ground for cyber criminals
8730420 whats great about mcafee siteadvisor is that it provides consumers with proactive protection simple red yellow and green safety ratings show consumers which sites are safe to visit before they interact with them we are excited that the millions of consumers who use mcafee siteadvisor can now avoid dangerous and risky sites and enjoy better online experiences

8730424 end users or consumers of these products have to deal with real live threats which may differ vastly from lab simulated environments these users build a strong customer trust for products that best meet their requirements and therefore also play a key role in the security evolution cycle
8730425 optus is pleased to be partnering with f secure to offer optus internet security suite to its customers the partnership enables optus to provide a broadband connection that is safe and secure from viruses hackers and other internet nasties we are offering this service until may 2008 free to all optus broadband customers for the first twelve months

8730531 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8730661 no longer needs the united states to support its engagement in the international community
8730662 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
8730663 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
8730664 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles

8730670 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major a major consumer issue
8730671 its nonsense they have to find out what caused this so that it can never happen again
8730672 if they dont find out how do i know that next month its not going to happen again or with some other products more care has to be put into how our food is prepared
8730673 because we knew we had made those products we had removed them from sale when the recall was initiated
8730674 we executed the recall we did it effectively efficiently and the products that are now being recalled were prepared and sold prior to the recall
8730675 if theres a problem with a product we pull the product off the floor and begin calling our customers and typically within 24 hours everyones been called

8730712 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8730713 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8730714 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8730715 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8730716 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8730717 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8730718 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8730719 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes

8730721 take now your son your only son whom you love isaac and go to the land of moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which i will tell you
8730722 a little while later and this same abraham was coming up from hebron on his mournful journey to offer up his only son a few miles south of the city the road which he travelled climbs up the top of a high promontory that juts into the deep kedron valley from this spot through the cleft of the mountains which the kedron has made its course one object rose up straight up before him it was moriah the mount on which the sacrifice of isaac was to be offered here solomon afterwards built the temple for over mount moriah david had seen the hand of the destroying angel stayed probably just above where afterwards fro the large alter of burnt offering the smoke of countless sacrifices rose day by day

8730731 we continue to apply our value oriented principles in selecting new growth stocks as we look for companies with superior profitability and strong balance sheets
8730732 our latest featured investment charles schwab is a prime example and stands out as a conservative way to access to opportunities in the battered financial group
8730733 we are increasing our equity allocation in stocks that should show strong relative performance in a market upturn
8730734 we continue however to be very selective in terms of quality as well as downside risk over the past 20 years brokerage asset management firms have produced more than twice the return of the market following a bear market
8730735 the charles schwab brand is one of the most well known and trusted names in the financial services industry its strategy is to be competitively priced but more importantly to be positioned as the gold standard in client service and integrity
8730736 over the past five years the company has aggressively diversified away from its dependence on trading commissions in favor of fee business in asset management banking and advisory services
8730737 today less than 20 of net revenue comes from trading while the other businesses are producing an enviable and consistent revenue stream that is growing at double digit rates
8730738 this sound diversification strategy has generated strong earnings results on an annualized basis schwabs earnings have grown in excess of 25 per year over the past five years
8730739 while this explosive growth will be hard to duplicate sustainable earnings growth is forecast to be in the range of 15 18 the company also has a solid balance sheet with long term debt comprising less than 20 of the firms capitalization
8730740 our valuation analysis suggests the companys share price is significantly undervalued as the stock is currently trading near a twelve year low in terms of valuation metrics
8730741 the stock is out of favor with investors primarily due to concerns about the volatile equity markets and a lawsuit that has been filed on behalf of schwab customers who allege they were misled about the safety of a mutual fund that invested in mortgage backed securities
8730742 in addition investors have recently become concerned about the firms exposure to auction rate securities regulators are questioning 40 major brokerages about their role in marketing these debt backed securities which became illiquid when the auction market dried up
8730743 in particular the new york attorney general is looking at what representations the brokerages made to their customers

8730757 obscured in the long shadow cast by towering gold and platinum a little known collection of other rare metals is sprouting and shooting up like jacks beanstalk right under investors noses
8730758 with some notable exceptions rare metals arent generally of much use by themselves but in combination with more common metals their unusual chemical properties allow the creation of super alloys with extraordinary capabilities needed for cutting edge technologies
8730759 the more obscure metals may not be as sexy as the precious metals and certainly dont get as much attention but they enable many technologies vital to modern industry
8730760 for example to combat soaring fuel costs that threaten its very survival the airline industry desperately needs turbines that can run at much higher temperatures and rpms
8730761 there are no world market exchanges for most rare metals prices and transactions for minor metals are negotiated directly between producers wholesalers and fabricators
8730762 its a relatively thin market compared to the volume traded in base metals which makes pricing highly volatile and vulnerable to even small variations in supply demand dynamics price moves of 300 500 800 and more have been common in recent years
8730763 the profit opportunities lie in the companies that produce and use rare metals junior explorers major miners processors producers which make specialty metals and integrators and recyclers
8730764 for starters i want to focus on titanium and molybdenum two rare metals whose price outlook is very positive
8730765 earnings are down not surprisingly due largely to the lackluster u s economy and airline industry but the companys share price is also cheap now trading at the 11 level near two year lows and a good long term bet on a solid company in a very unique space
8730766 thompson creek metals company one of the largest publicly traded pure molybdenum producers in the world the company owns the thompson creek open pit molybdenum mine and mill in idaho
8730767 the company also has a 75 share of the endako open pit mine mill and roasting facility in northern british columbia and a metallurgical roasting facility in pennsylvania
8730768 tcs second quarter 2008 saw higher production volumes with molybdenum production rising 10
8730769 the fed is walking a fine but knowing line between recession stagflation and inflation to avoid a 1970s debacle bernanke has restrained money growth at home while other central banks have allowed money to flood their own economies
8730770 australia sweden canada and britain are showing money growth that is two or more times that of the us
8730771 i do think that stagflation like pressures remain and that while the fed isnt printing money willy nilly it is heading in that direction with a new kind of printer the american tax payer
8730772 the unprecedented bailouts of non government entities with out tax dollars that weve witnessed so far this year are problematic on many levels
8730773 moreover the governments bailout plan of the us consumer by way of writing stimulus checks thanks to our future tax dollars is the biggest sub prime loan of all
8730774 and while the experts say that all the above bailouts were necessary to avoid one version of a market meltdown or another id argue that propping up failed systems is the biggest systemic risk that we face
8730775 meanwhile among our latest do it now recommendations we suggest buying the

8730808 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8730809 we think at this point you should look at it as a growth company
8730810 looking out over the next several years regardless of where oil trades this company because of its world position its strong balance sheet tis broad array of products will have a strong 20 percent growth rate

8730818 ritengo che la squadra che sta proponendo la candidatura a sindaco dellimprenditore antonio dabrosca abbia visto giusto e con largo anticipo rispetto alla naturale scadenza del mandato dellamministrazione comunale in carica il progetto politico in via di elaborazione secondo me credibile e necessario il paese ha bisogno di uninversione di tendenza ormai non pi rinviabile infatti giunto il tempo in cui si deve capire pure a grazzanise che un imprenditore politico pu dare pi di un esponente politico di vecchio stampo malgrado sia un caparbio avversario sul piano nazionale per me lattuale premier berlusconi tuttavia un trascinante esempio di imprenditoria prestata alla politica
8730819 a differenza dellattuale sindaco nella cui lista pur avendo uninsufficiente conoscenza del personaggio e della compagine che tuttora lo sostiene ma fidandomi soltanto del suo operato nei cinque anni precedenti e delle speranze che ancora suscitava nella cittadinanza mi sono candidato risultando eletto nel 2005 ho invece una profonda conoscenza di dabrosca in quanto candidato a sindaco e delle persone che formano il gruppo di reg a e del quale mi onoro far parte fin dal primo giorno in questo gruppo pur rispettando i ruoli si liberi di pensare e di agire nella legalit e nella trasparenza e ci con laria che tirava e tira tuttora nella maggioranza svoltista un dato alternativo di grande valore
8730820 dacch sono uscito dalla maggioranza cio dal novembre 2006 non ho mai riconosciuto altro possibile aspirante al ruolo di primo cittadino che antonio dabrosca se altri si sono illusi che io potessi confondere i rapporti amichevoli con il concreto appoggio elettorale dal momento che considero la politica come arte nobile seria e veramente al servizio della comunit si trattato di un loro errore di cui non mi sento per nulla responsabile e proprio per queste ragioni vorrei ufficialmente dichiarare laperto sostegno di italia dei valori a liberazione democratica la cui prima iniziativa in atto in questi giorni coincide con un popolare tentativo di difesa del presidio di continuit assistenziale guardia medica che purtroppo perderemo dal prossimo 1 settembre e quindi invito tutti i cittadini a firmare la petizione che punta al ripristino del prezioso servizio sanitario durgenza a favore delle persone di qualsiasi et e di qualunque colore politico

8730862 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8730863 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick at the time and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented to him
8730864 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8730865 i would hope that the democrats could have enough senators elected in november so that we would not any longer need to include joe lieberman among the senators

8730874 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8730875 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8730876 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8730877 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8730878 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products

8730892 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
8730893 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8730894 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8730895 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8730896 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8730897 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational

8730905 the majority of us lead quiet unheralded lives as we pass through this world there will most likely be no ticker tape parades for us no monuments created in our honor but that does not lessen our possible impact for there are scores of people waiting for someone like us to come along people who will appreciate our compassion our encouragement who will need our unique talents someone who will live a happier life merely because we took the time to share what we had to give too often we underestimate the power of a touch a smile a kind word a listening ear an honest compliment or the smallest act of caring all of which have the potential to turn a life around it is overwhelming to consider the numerous opportunities there are to make our love felt

8730920 tom clearly is one of the best writers and teachers of writing in the world today
8730921 he wrote a seminal piece of journalism called a cry in the night that dominated our craft for a long time and made a model for the rest of us to follow
8730922 hes been my teacher since the day i met him iu will soon get a glimpse of his passion and ferocious belief that journalism should be fair and truthful but also raucous subversive emotional and daring
8730923 in the small group of writers who led the renaissance in newspaper narratives in the 80s and 90s and he is known around the world for his evangelism on the subject which is why iu came calling
8730924 tom has so many strengths one is that he knows how to do journalism he has a body of work that students can study and learn from which i think is the best way for a student to learn
8730925 second he knows how to explain journalism ive heard him teach many times and every time ive walked away excited by the possibilities of what we do

8731005 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8731006 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
8731007 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing

8731019 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8731020 the environment of sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner
8731021 even if the storm veers to the west and south away from productive infrastructure in the gulf the outer bands which produce extraordinary rainfall amounts will put important refineries along the texas coast in jeopardy of flooding

8731064 im going to wait and see what happens with the storm
8731065 i think most people here are prepared and are ready to leave if they have to but some people with the high gas prices might have to ride the storm out
8731066 the buses will be sent out initially to help those who really cant evacuate themselves

8731071 i am scheduled to be in minnesota tomorrow to be at the state fair
8731072 doing the speech at mile high is an important point for our campaign its symbolic of how sen obama won the nomination it will show how obama wants to involve people who are not usually involved in the political process

8731084 the difference between web 2 0 and enterprise 2 0 is like the difference building a tunnel through rock and tunnel under water the enterprise 2 0 tunnel is built under water this takes more engineering understanding but it also requires more fault testing and assurances a crack or crumbling of a tool inside an organization is not seen kindly and raises doubts around the viability of the tool web 2 0 does not work well in enterprise but the approaches and understandings of web 2 0 modified for enterprise work really well

8731093 veel van de problemen van de industri le voedselketen vloeien voort uit zijn lengte en complexiteit er bevindt zich een muur van onwetendheid tussen consumenten en producenten
8731094 in een lange voedselketen raken het verhaal en de identiteit van het voedsel zoek in de ongedifferentieerde stroom van handelsartikelen zodat de enige informatie die tussen consumenten en producenten wordt uitgewisseld bestaat uit de prijs in een korte voedselketen kunnen eters hun behoeften en verlangens bekendmaken aan de boer en kunnen boeren eters doordringen van het onderscheid tussen gewoon en uitzonderlijk voedsel en de vele redenen waarom uitzonderlijk voedsel zijn prijs waard is voedsel krijgt weer zijn verhaal en iets van zijn verhevenheid terug als degene die het gekweekt heeft het persoonlijk overhandigt

8731097 domain names that start with a get more spam than domain names that start with z

8731115 you know if you believe in what youre doing you can take the heat they obviously are worried about putting theirs out because they know it would not be good they know

8731118 es bueno ver que se junte tanta gente a favor de la justicia y de la reforma migratoria y de la dignidad humana
8731119 es una muestra de la vitalidad del movimiento pro inmigrante y del hecho que los grupos anti inmigrantes se est n desmoronando
8731120 por eso esta marcha tiene sentido y por eso acept la invitaci n para participar
8731121 tenemos que defender los derechos de todas las personas que est n en este pa s incluso los inmigrantes porque somos una naci n de inmigrantes
8731122 debemos reconocer las contribuciones de los inmigrantes a la econom a del pa s y por eso la reforma debe incluir un elemento para que 12 millones de personas ya no vivan en las sombras
8731123 estas marchas en defensa de los derechos de los inmigrantes son necesarias es porque el actual sistema inmigratorio est quebrado
8731124 que el sistema no funciona se ve en el enfoque de odio hacia los inmigrantes que forma parte del discurso actual sobre inmigraci n y el sistema migratorio est quebrado porque sus leyes no reflejan los valores y principios sobre los que se fund este pa s
8731125 la discriminaci n y el odio contra los inmigrantes van en contra de los valores de la comunidad de fe cualquiera que sea esa fe

8731134 most of the people here were affluent they were doctors dentists here at meharry medical center tennessee state and fisk university
8731135 its the economically sensible approach you cannot design a system where you put forth exceptions from the beginning and expect to get the cost savings that includes everyone
8731136 we can all come up with an objection and thats why we dont get anything done
8731137 when we come forward with a democratic plan and we have a democratic majority in the house thats even bigger and we have a democratic president we have to have all you of outside of the legislative process pushing as hard as you can to make it happen
8731138 its going to take all of the energy and the honeymoon period a new president is afforded

8731158 one hundred years after the emancipation proclamation the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
8731159 we can never be satisfied as long as the negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality
8731160 we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities
8731161 we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote
8731162 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character

8731164 i and my daughter safia batool were alone with children in home when police barged in to the house from all directions creating terror despite repeated pleas they did not allow us even to wear burqa the women police constables even abused us in filthy language and closed the mouth of my daughter
8731165 police team wanted to give an element of surprise but we did not intend to hurt the feelings on the issue of paurdah we have assured the family that such things will not happen in future
8731166 when the police asked that they were looking for jabir i told him that he had gone for evening prayers and they can look for him in the mosque since then my son is missing
8731167 we are not against searches we are ready to cooperate with the police if they seek it but this is not the method of doing it they have humiliated us by forcing us to remain with out burqa
8731168 will the last business in downtown auburn please turn out the lights

8731170 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8731171 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8731172 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8731173 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8731174 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8731175 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
8731176 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8731177 our team is looking forward to the milwaukee cup tournament we have two quality teams coming to valley fields as both went to the ncaa tournament in 2007 ohio state is talented and has great depth they will be determined after their narrow season opening loss on wednesday night
8731178 samford might be an unknown in our area but it has had much success on the field throughout the years they are very well coached and we expect an excellent team
8731179 we have learned from our win over loyola and hopefully we see improvement in our play this weekend small details can be deciding factors in any game and we addressed several throughout practice this week we are excited to get back out on the field
8731180 no hard feelings you cant sue us later because we told you this was coming
8731181 i have to escort you back to your desk now because we can no longer trust you to wander around on your own so you can collect your meager collection of pictures and toys and books and whatever and get out right now
8731182 amyloid beta is normally present in the cerebrospinal fluid and it was generally believed to be a normal component of the brain extracellular fluid
8731183 because synaptic activity in their brains increased concomitantly with the improvement in neurological status
8731184 our outlook for the second quarter is expected to be consistent with first quarter guidance with a continued focus on delivering solid cash performance
8731185 the increased potential for our engineered valves in special markets such as nuclear navy and the oil and petrochemical industries
8731186 there are also signs more buyers may be getting ready to return to the market
8731187 we have 22 of our 38 facilities in guelph so the vast majority of the impact would be felt in guelph but its not limited just to ontario
8731188 each of the general managers is assessing the work force every day and then assessing any layoff numbers they are temporary and our goal is to get people back as quickly as possible so that numbers going to always be in flux
8731189 were at a point now with the volume reductions being what they are that weve had no choice but to start looking at our workforce and conducting temporary layoffs
8731190 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by five 10 15 cents a gallon
8731191 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 per cent
8731192 i think thats taking some of the steam out of this rally
8731193 if people start cancelling their vacations to the gulf because of the storm were probably going to have less demand for fuel than anticipated
8731194 while they now have the excuse of a slower economy to hide behind and they used it as such in their release results were weak
8731195 despite the weakness the company is clinging to the belief that its second half will be stronger helped by massive expense cuts and by pulling inventory lower we have seen this picture before and it is not a happy ending
8731196 our second quarter results reflect the continued effects of a slowing economy which contributed to the earnings declines we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007
8731197 it seems even from their perspective its been a pretty rough year so far
8731198 but i think the sales environment is going to remain challenging through the remainder of the year and theyre going to continue to feel the pain particularly in accessories like appliances and tools that are directly related to home
8731199 i think that some people are trying to figure out some bottoming process and they might have come in here and come in early or they may feel a trading stance is warranted
8731200 sometimes it just takes a lack of horrendous news to allow something to fall back up if you push a spring down hard enough it will snap back at you almost every time even one thats pretty rusty and old
8731201 weighing together likely slowdowns in export growth and consumer spending and the continued troubles in the banking and housing sectors forecasters expect gdp growth to slow to about 1 5 per cent in the third quarter and to near zero in the fourth

8731206 maar hier in de winkel kun je er zijn voor de mensen niet alleen samen kerkje spelen maar open staan naar de wereld
8731207 maar soms zitten mensen opeens met een probleempje en willen ze even tot rust komen iemand vinden die dan even naar je luistert dat is in de huidige wereld de moeilijkheid
8731208 wij horen mensen aan daarna kunnen we ze bij god brengen hun problemen bij het kruis leggen
8731209 als iemand alleen maar wil internetten is dat ook goed doordat we dat gratis aanbieden stralen we ook wat van gods liefde uit

8731216 thursday august 28 2008 shut the f up current mood bullied i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i was angry when i first read his attack on me but for me i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him i am not standing in his way i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is his need to throw a tantrum for the whole world to hear is i am not going to go into a play by play defense i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him p s im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else so i think its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan
8731217 thursday august 28 2008 drug free current mood betrayed category life if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world i think we know where the rest of this blog is going if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embaressment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful this further proves that any information that my father has about me or the people in my life is internet based and about as accurate as a page six item im not going to engage any further though i probably could go on i have said enough i have a therapist and it is not the the camera man at x17
8731218 we believe this situation will not constrain our ability to build our tequila brands to their fullest potential
8731219 all flights have been cancelled and passengers are being advised to seek bookings with alternative airlines
8731220 the unprecedented rise in the price of aviation fuel which resulted in a 50 million dollar us increase in operating costs during the last year and the general economic downturn had made it impossible for operations to continue
8731221 a direct consequence of the horrendous increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate
8731222 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8731223 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8731224 the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8731225 we have sought creditor protection by filing legal notices of intention to appoint an administrator in both the united kingdom and canada
8731226 the latest forecasts for tropical storm gustav suggest a slightly lower chance of major disruptions in oil production
8731227 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8731228 the environment of sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner
8731229 even if the storm veers to the west and south away from productive infrastructure in the gulf the outer bands which produce extraordinary rainfall amounts will put important refineries along the texas coast in jeopardy of flooding
8731230 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8731231 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8731232 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8731233 i have had discussions with representatives of both air canada and westjet about fuel costs and what that is doing to the industry
8731234 if we find passengers in difficult circumstances everybody is going to have to work together to deal with that
8731235 the management of alitalia will remain in the hands of italians
8731236 prospective foreign partners will take a stake in the new company only as minority shareholders
8731237 we have avoided the solution proposed by the previous government which would have seen alitalia sold off cheaply to the national company of italys main competitor in international tourism
8731238 we had a duty to do something we have done something concrete we have succeeded
8731239 air france klm confirms its interest and its wish to continue as the strategic partner for alitalia
8731240 with this in mind and if prospects for the new company are confirmed air france klm is ready to take a minority stake in the capital of the new company alongside the investors gathered together by italian bank intesa sanpaolo
8731241 arcelormittal dofasco is not a union operation and the current negotiations do not affect any of arcelormittals canadian operations
8731242 talks between arcelormittal management and the usw continue with frequent meetings throughout the day in pittsburgh
8731243 our members and retirees have earned a fair and equitable contract through years of hard work sacrifice and uncertainty
8731244 arcelormittal is aware that the usw membership has voted for a strike authorization however negotiations continue and we remain committed to working with the usw to reach a settlement by sept 1
8731245 current position does not do justice to our needs and demands and does not match the pattern set by the u s steel agreement
8731246 but it usually is a sign of impatience in bargaining
8731247 a strike vote is putting a bullet in the chamber
8731248 a sign that negotiations have really reached a stage where intensity in bargaining is necessary and you have to break from the past trend
8731249 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8731250 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8731251 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8731252 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year
8731253 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualized economic growth to recede to near 1 0 percent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving
8731254 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast
8731255 we also have approximately 200 to 300 that were previously on layoff
8731256 so tomorrow if theres a need for 20 more employees theyre calling them
8731257 with our volumes being down theres obviously going to be some idle employees in our manufacturing plants necessitating layoffs
8731258 by being creative with our workforce and how were operating aggressively managing our costs and overhead
8731259 our existing contracts are in place the volumes of what they are though have been reduced as demand has slowed
8731260 one of the key reasons that weve probably managed quite well compared to our competitors and other manufacturers is that we have strategically diversified not only in our customers but in our products
8731261 to be proactive in managing our costs so that when things do pick up were not in trouble but are able to carry on
8731262 will continue to be the case for the next couple of quarters
8731263 the industry is looking like well see a 20 per cent plus decline this year and maybe another 10 to 15 per cent decline next year
8731264 is a lot less than what weve seen from their customers and from the overall market

8731266 interestingly all shift workers were more likely to cut back on sleep when they needed more time and were more likely to worry about not spending enough time with family
8731267 even though these are considered among the most difficult shifts because the body cannot properly adjust to the sleep pattern changes rotating child care is difficult to find and health effects can be profound

8731286 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
8731287 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
8731288 is what they are doing a good simulation of what is happening in the real world
8731289 the main question is whether the activity whatever it is is educationally valid and contributes significantly to whatever is being studied
8731290 the point is not whether kids are playing with learning or what medium they are playing in a ball field or a wii setup or a physics lab or art studio but rather why they are doing it just because it is electronic does not make it any better and it may turn out not to be as valuable

8731374 while it may be possible for an mlm to operate within the law when the rewards for participating individuals are based primarily on recruiting additional participants and not on selling the underlying product it is appropriate for governments at both the federal and state level to investigate and act where deception and abuse are occurring

8731385 new orleans has experienced a profound change in who governs schools and a dramatic reduction of parent and local taxpayer control of schools
8731386 50 of them are charter schools privatized management governed by self appointed self perpetuating boards 33 are run by the state department of education through the recovery school district and only five are governed by the elected school board
8731387 there are now 42 separate school systems operating in new orleans
8731388 school policies including teacher requirements curriculum discipline policies enrollment limits and social promotions publicly accountable schools in which parents have methods for publicly redressing grievances are limited to only five schools 5 6 percent of the total
8731389 but the people down here need the world to understand that its still a tragic situation the rent has tripled the health care system is in shambles we have less access to education for our kids the working class and poor are being exploited while everyone at the top is getting fat off our misery

8731395 we do not accept that israel can stop these boats palestinians have the same rights as all other peoples why is it that the only people in the mediterranean without access to their own waters are the palestinians

8731398 dado que a moldura penal era inferior a 5 anos e portanto n o permitia a deten o fora de flagrante delito n o fazia sentido que fossem presentes ao juiz

8731403 its not even really a metaphor for slavery slavery is whats going on
8731404 i would truthfully say that angola prison is a sophisticated plantation
8731405 cotton is king still applies when it come to angola
8731406 allows inmates to be trained in work habits and allows them to develop marketable skills in the areas of farming animal husbandry vegetable meat and milk processing
8731407 the warden says it takes good food good medicine good prayin and good playin to have a good prison
8731408 in the conventional plantations slaves were given just enough food clothing and shelter to be a financial asset to the owner the same is true for the louisiana prison system
8731409 prisoners worked out in the field sometimes 17 hours straight rain or shine
8731410 theyd tell you the officer was always right no matter what
8731411 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states
8731412 prisoners can be forced to work for the government against their will and this is true in every state
8731413 i would have more faith in that amendment if it werent so clear that our criminal justice system is racially biased in a really obvious way
8731414 i dont have any illusions that this is a simple process
8731415 many people are apathetic about what happens in prisons it would be very difficult but i would not suggest it would be impossible
8731416 many black inmates viewed farm work under these circumstances as too close to slavery to want to participate
8731417 theyve got a lot of land to bury a lot of prisoners

8731422 cantor has not yet appeared on the convention schedule which would seem strange for such a dynamic member of the house gops leadership
8731423 cantor has impeccable conservative credentials and his selection would go a long way towards energizing the republican base for the election he has an engaging speaking style and has no problem with political infighting as a debater he could be expected to match up well with joe biden but more importantly he could fire up crowds on the campaign trail for mccain

8731442 stands for the right to strike by the working class as a fundamental right
8731443 in the context of certain remarks made by bhattacharjee in a meeting of assocham in kolkata
8731444 it has consistently supported all india general strikes of the trade unions against the neo liberal policies of the central government and other urgent issues of the working class and toiling people

8731450 we have a very talented and dedicated group of students who are ready and able to tackle the fundamental chemistry problems that must be solved before it will be feasible to produce clean solar fuels on a large scale
8731451 we already have several industrial partners and we intend to add more as we want to move the new materials and processes invented by our center into the commercial arena as rapidly as possible
8731452 these transformations will require the development of new models for understanding multiple electron and proton transfer reactions and catalyst design
8731453 i strongly support chemistrys cbc program as a way to tackle grand challenge problems with potentially transformative societal impacts such as sustainable energy the nocera work and the powering the planet center is an excellent example of this
8731454 this coexistence is an exotic superconducting state that has not been observed in any other superconducting material
8731455 it shows a very strong link between superconductivity and magnetism
8731456 its not clear what the origin of this state is or what creates or modifies it
8731457 its really a question of the chicken and the egg
8731458 does superconductivity need magnetism in this state or does magnetism need superconductivity
8731459 this is a new paradigm for understanding the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity
8731460 it could help us find the basis for understanding unconventional high temperature superconductivity

8731471 my uncle was a hindu i dont know why they attacked him and his family possibly it was due to confusion over his religious identity
8731472 all the christians had left the village and moved into the jungle fearing violence the attackers perhaps mistook gayadhar to be a christian and vented their ire on him
8731473 he practiced christianity for sometime but was back to the hindu fold later maybe those in the mob who were from nearby areas didnt know about his reentering hinduism
8731474 the situation in kandhmal is such that christians have started claiming to be hindus to escape communalists rage as such its difficult to ascertain religious affiliation of people many people even after embracing christianity choose to remain hindus in official records for sc st benefits
8731475 it eases eligibility requirements for low income beneficiaries to get help with the out of pocket expenses of medicare and finally moves toward ending the injustice of medicare paying so little for mental health compared to general health care
8731476 this is the only benefit expansion that weve seen in five years
8731477 aarp fought very hard to include these benefits in the new law without their cost causing a substantial rise in part b premiums
8731478 delaying the start of some benefits lowers the cost of the overall package and prevents it from adding to the deficit
8731479 overall the majority of cuts in the legislation come from medicare advantage plans
8731480 that is going to have the effect of either reduced benefits higher out of pocket costs or more limited health care choices for seniors
8731481 the vast majority will either need to create a network or leave the market

8731561 es un grupo muy complicado muy dif cil donde cada partido ser como una final el marsella ya nos complic mucho el a o pasado tanto que gan en anfield y nos tuvimos que jugar la clasificaci n en su estadio el psv eindhoven es un rival correoso y el atl tico en su estreno querr dar la mejor imagen posible sin duda mi deseo es que liverpool y atl tico en este orden pasen a octavos de final
8731562 ser muy especial para m y seguro que me encantar espero un buen recibimiento de la afici n porque el atl tico me dio mucho pero yo tambi n di mucho al atl tico entiendo que cuando empiecen los partidos me ver n como un adversario pero nunca podr olvidar los a os que pas all para m ser una sensaci n maravillosa cuando vuelva a pisar el calder n y me encuentre all con antiguos compa eros y amigos
8731563 recuerdo especialmente el gol que del vel dromo porque sirvi para afianzar la victoria y empezar este a o all me trasmite sensaciones positivas
8731564 un partido muy dif cil donde ellos salieron a buscar el empate a cero y nos cost m s de lo normal superarles han demostrado ser un gran equipo durante los 210 minutos que dur la eliminatoria
8731565 cuando enfrentamos a honduras el equipo completo estuvo junto en una sola pr ctica ahora tendremos cinco y buscaremos la victoria
8731566 vamos a jamaica con la idea de ganar cuando se juega f tbol siempre hay riesgo pero estamos bien
8731567 no soy el presidente de la federaci n nacional pero si por m fuera el partido de tuxtla guti rrez ante canad ser el ltimo de las eliminatorias fuera de la ciudad de m xico

8731575 un grupo complicado es mejor para empezar fuerte y arrancar mejor
8731576 es un gran equipo y de un conjunto as se pueden hacer pocos an lisis siempre tienen peligro llegan con muchas ganas por no haber competido el pasado a o
8731577 es el equipo de moda ganaron la copa de la uefa y van a disputar la supercopa es un conjunto peligroso compensado y con jugadores de mucha calidad
8731578 es un modesto que hay que respetar porque todos te pueden sorprender y si perdemos puntos al principio puede que sean dif ciles de recuperar
8731579 de este tipo de sorteos en la competici n m s importante del f tbol de clubes no se pueden hacer pron sticos para ganar la liga de campeones hay que ganar a los mejores
8731580 otros espa oles sobre el papel lo tienen m s f cil
8731581 por mi cabeza pasa ganar los seis puntos nunca ha pasado otra cosa aunque es l gico que si tenemos que hacer un promedio pues que sea el ideal y si es as tenemos que pensar en m nimo cuatro pero nuestro sue o nuestra pelea y nuestra propuesta son los seis puntos
8731582 tiene un buen contragolpe y jugadores como luis su rez christian rodr guez y sebasti n abreu que son importantes que manejan muy bien los espacios
8731583 en general uruguay tiene un grupo defensivo pesado duro recio atr s como siempre fue el f tbol uruguayo hemos visto algunos v deos y sabemos c mo manejan el contragolpe como lo hicieron por ejemplo ante brasil al que le jugaron adelantado vamos a esperarlos para ver c mo act an
8731584 de chile hemos valorado los cambios de n mina que ha hecho tiene ahora un f tbol m s vertical m s de choque de mucha m s presi n que cualquier otro equipo
8731585 es una tarea en la que estamos trabajando sin embargo hay que decir que los responsables de la cuota del gol no solamente son los delanteros es todo el equipo as como defensivamente tambi n todo el equipo es responsable
8731586 hay dos opciones para el futuro con ocho jugadores que tienen tarjetas amarillas en diferentes posiciones o si se dan lesiones ellos son jonathan estrada y milton rodr guez de millonarios
8731587 no voy a hablar ni pensar en el retiro estar 100 por ciento enfocado en lo que har sobre el ring esa es mi prioridad
8731588 s que la gente dice que ser una pelea f cil para oscar pero yo estoy seguro que dar la batalla como siempre la he dado soy m s r pido y m s joven
8731589 cuando has estado pensando en esta pelea por los pasados meses y la gente asegura que manny me puede noquear eso lo hizo personal
8731590 he asimilado qu significan los filipinos en los estados unidos y el mundo con este boxeador ellos son reconocidos por ser personas luchadoras
8731591 el deporte m s popular y universal que existe en el mundo
8731592 creo que el manchester hizo una gran temporada y yo marqu muchos goles me siento muy orgulloso de haber sido premiado como mejor delantero aunque juegue de extremo esto es muy positivo para m y aumenta mi ambici n para mejorar gracias a todos mis compa eros de equipo y aquellos que me hayan votado

8731595 por mi cabeza pasa el ganar los 6 puntos nunca ha pasado otra cosa aunque es l gico que si tenemos que hacer un promedio pues que sea el ideal y si es as tenemos que pensar en m nimo 4 pero nuestro sue o nuestra pelea y nuestra propuesta son los 6 puntos
8731596 tiene un buen contragolpe y jugadores como luis su rez cristian rodr guez o sebasti n abreu que son hombres importantes que manejan muy bien los espacios
8731597 en general uruguay tiene un grupo defensivo pesado duro recio atr s como siempre fue el f tbol uruguayo pero igual nosotros hemos visto algunos v deos y conocemos como manejan el contragolpe como lo hicieron por ejemplo ante brasil al que le jugaron adelantado nosotros vamos a esperarlo para ver como va a ser su accionar t ctico si se meten atr s en fin
8731598 de chile hemos valorado los cambios de nomina que ha hecho tiene ahora un f tbol m s vertical m s de choque de mucha m s presi n que cualquier otro equipo
8731599 es una tarea en la que estamos trabajando luchando por hombres por caracter sticas por fundamentos de juegos que estamos buscando clarificar haciendo uso de diferentes posibilidades sin embargo hay que decir que los responsables de la cuota del gol no solamente son los delanteros somos todo el equipo as como defensivamente tambi n todo el equipo es responsable
8731600 hay dos opciones para el futuro de acuerdo a situaciones como las que tenemos en la selecci n con 8 jugadores que tienen tarjetas amarillas en diferentes posiciones por lo tanto quedan dos jugadores con opci n de ser convocados terminado el partido de uruguay si se dan lesiones o si se presenta la suspensi n de alguno por tarjetas amarillas ellos son jonathan estrada y milton rodr guez de millonarios
8731601 ellos est n ac en bogot y son jugadores que r pidamente se unir an al grupo adem s vienen haciendo las cosas bien jonathan estrada ya estuvo con nosotros de pronto milton rodr guez no pero vemos que est n produciendo y est n levantando su nivel
8731602 colombia se ha hecho fuerte en su casa y va invicto le empat a brasil le gan a argentina aunque ha convertido pocos goles lleva dos puntos m s que nosotros en la eliminatoria quiere decir que es un equipo que tampoco recibe goles
8731603 en ciertas zonas del equipo se mantiene muy estable creo que es un equipo duro dif cil y que juega en condici n de local
8731604 es un buen equipo que quiz s ha pagado los problemas de un mal inicio despu s intent recuperar en la ltima fecha tuvo un empate como local que le quit un poco de expectativa pero creo que de los equipos que van debajo de nosotros en la tabla se me antoja que es uno de los que todav a tiene posibilidades
8731605 ser un importante juego que se realizar con la idea de recaudar fondos para construir casas a los futbolistas retirados del uruguay que se encuentran en precarios recursos
8731606 nadie esta al nivel de ellos lo que han hecho estos tres jugadores es una barbaridad antes los top ten se repart an m s los t tulos pero ahora hay tres monstruos que se lo llevan todo y es mucho m s dif cil los dem s no es que somos m s flojos que antes es que ahora han coincidido tres numeros uno por eso yo soy el uno de los humanos
8731607 ha sido complicado es un jugador inc modo que te da cero ritmo sacaba muy bien y me ha costado entrar en juego aunque poco a poco me he ido haciendo con l aunque sufriendo m s de la cuenta la valoraci n que saco es positiva en el aspecto mental porque he estado concentrado ten sticamente tampoco he estado todo lo bien que quer a pero al final lo que cuenta es ganar y mientras est s bien de cabeza lucha y entrega ya llegar n las buenas sensaciones
8731608 no me importa haber jugado en la pista 7 lo realmente importante es que he ganado sufriendo y eso queda en una an cdota m s l gicamente prefiero jugar en la armstrong o en la pista central pero personalmente tampoco me importa
8731609 es un jugador muy peligroso es muy joven y en un futuro estar ah arriba seguro ahora vienen generaciones nuevas que dar n mucho que hablar tendr que estar muy concentrado y mejorar mi tenis para poder ganar tendr que correr mucho y estar muy sufridor
8731610 es complicado estar igual de fino que el a o pasado que fue el mejor de mi carrera e hice un torneo espectacular aqu y en shanghai y eso es algo que pasa pocas veces
8731611 tengo varias propuestas para convertirme en profesional pero no me voy a precipitar y analizar las diversas opciones para tomar el compromiso donde mejor me vaya
8731612 antes de beijing tuve varias propuesta de empresas promotoras pero mi mente estaba s lo en los ol mpicos y ahora con calma analizar la mejor opci n por si decido convertime en profesional
8731613 estoy tranquilo pese al inter s de los promotores descansar con mi familia y analizar mi futuro porque no quiero tomar una decisi n precipitada si ingreso al terreno profesional

8731617 el dinero no lo es todo pero cuatro millones son muchos millones
8731618 en este equipo hay grandes jugadores y estoy seguro de que este a o podemos hacer grandes cosas debemos confiar en nosotros mismos seguro que se va a conseguir algo algo es un t tulo cualquiera me gustar a
8731619 el atl tico de madrid es uno de los grandes y tiene que pasar el grupo que nos ha tocado no es f cil pero vamos a hacer todo lo posible para pasar a la siguiente fase los partidos se juegan para ganarlos y es lo que vamos a hacer
8731620 lo conocemos bien y l a nosotros ser algo bonito pero los que van a jugar son el atl tico y el liverpool no fernando torres y el kun
8731621 lo conozco y puedo decir que es un gran jugador esperamos que pueda demostrar aqu su calidad
8731622 el juego ente honduras fue muy bonito en el estadio azteca fue una experiencia muy grande y bonita s me gusta que se juegue en el azteca porque tambi n es muy pr ctico porque tenemos aqu un complejo de entrenamiento y el estadio es bonito y m s grande
8731623 los partidos amistosos pienso que tal vez hay que jugarlos en otros lugares para dar oportunidad a la gente de ver a la selecci n para m es importante la clasificaci n la eliminatoria porque el costo de esto es muy grande
8731624 pero no soy muy est pido si ellos los federativos dicen que tiene que ser as ser as

8731627 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8731628 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8731629 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8731630 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8731631 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8731632 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8731633 ellos van a venir a ganar porque necesitan los puntos y noostros tenemos la obligaci n como equipo grande y porque estamos en casa de tener el partido dominado para poder ganarlo y seguir arriba en la tabla que es lo que m s nos interesa
8731634 sabemos que es un buen equipo y que tiene una buena defensa y tambien un buen ataque porque tienen al goleador del torneo el colombiano hugo rodallega nosotros debemos estar mentalizados a que de local tenemos que ganar para seguir arriba en la tabla
8731635 nosotros tendremos que hacer lo de siempre en la ofensiva con mucha movilidad para crear espacios y situaciones de gol
8731636 somos jugadores j venes con mucha movilidad y din mica nos entendemos bien as que esperamos que los partido que vienes seguir haciendo goles para bien del equipo que lo necesita y que el equipo gane es lo m s importnate
8731637 en esta competencia siempre hay sorpresas y muchos corredores no se la pondr n f cil a los espa oles es seguro que los nombres de contador y sastre sonar n mucho durante la vuelta pero no apuesto por ninguno ya que habr quienes se juegan aqu la temporada
8731638 hay corredores como leipheimer kloden que son del equipo de alberto contador y que vienen por la victoria
8731639 convoco a los mejores jugadores del momento son los m s fuertes y buenos del momento
8731640 nosotros en plural porque incluye a su cuerpo t cnico vamos a jamaica a intentar ganar el juego pienso que es m s f cil jugar mejor porque ahora tenemos cinco entrenamientos antes del juego
8731641 tengo mucha confianza en ellos porque son el presente y el futuro del futbol mexicano eso pienso si van a jugar desde el primer minuto ante jamaica ya veremos el pr ximo s bado
8731642 no creo que es un factor mental la falta de contundencia de los atacantes s lo es algo extra o que pasa en el futbol pienso que jugamos mejor en el primer tiempo aunque en el segundo marcamos dos goles
8731643 nada me sorprende me gusta el futbol ser criticado es as hay que tener paciencia gan el juego que es lo m s importante ante honduras durante los 90 minutos en muchos momentos jugamos buen futbol ahora va ser mejor y van a estar bastante contento
8731644 casi todos los juegos que giovani ha hecho con el tottenham lo hizo como delantero m s se que juega muy bien por el lado derecho no creo que haya problemas con l en el futuro va estar como centrodelantero cuando tenga m s experiencia

8731734 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8731735 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8731736 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance
8731737 i think we shouldnt be too complacent or too scared in a situation like this
8731738 to give up and surrender and say to the russians its your backyard youve won or to put men on the ground to protect georgias sovereignty and the east west oil and gas pipeline from the caspian and central asia

8731754 we can confirm that on 21 august 2008 three separate attempts were made via a single logon id to access the same data from a single hotel
8731755 the hotel in question is the 107 room best western hotel am schloss kopenick in berlin germany where a trojan horse virus was detected by the hotels antivirus software
8731756 we can also confirm that we have been able to narrow down the number of customers affected by this breach to 10
8731757 we are currently contacting those customers and offering assistance as needed
8731758 purges reservations data within seven days of guest departure thereby limiting potential data exposure
8731759 we got the warning from the antivirus software and after that we turned off the systems and changed the systems
8731760 we cut off our internet connection informed it and turned everything off immediately i dont know the details of the virus it was only 10 people who were affected the clients who were hacked have been informed
8731761 what i found was on one of the top underground forums for the rbn trading network
8731762 there was an indian hacker selling a log in to best westerns systems with a screenshot saying the log in can get access to credit card numbers and card verification codes

8731770 we want to continue to provide our fans in the pc world a rich and engaging experience
8731771 but that doesn t mean we can t also release the same title on consoles it takes nothing away from the pc gamer if the game is also available on another platform
8731772 console technology has advanced a great deal since we released far cry
8731773 our teams have since found it very exciting to push the boundaries of what most people today consider possible to do on those platforms both technically and artistically
8731774 consoles themselves are in one sense simply very good drm technologies
8731775 consumers welcome and pay for consoles in order to receive the benefits that come with them such as the healthy variety of games which are able to prosper in such a protected environment and the greater ease of installation use and reliability
8731776 a problem can crop up in just one instant and you dont realize its there until its too late

8731778 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8731779 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability
8731780 it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke
8731781 many stroke survivors believe theres nothing to be gained from further rehabilitation but our results suggest that health and functional benefits from walking on a treadmill can occur even decades out from stroke
8731782 the scale of this criminal enterprise is unprecedented in this country the roll call of deaths and injuries is horrific some 30 to 40 of these weapons are still unaccounted for and regrettably but doubtlessly the roll call of death and serious injury will continue to rise
8731783 the journal strives to provide the massage bodywork profession and related health science communities with a peer reviewed scientific forum that is open access for its readership and contributing authors
8731784 against the backdrop of the ongoing emphasis on evidence informed practice the journal seeks to advance professional practice reflective of three critical components specifically current research findings relevant client patient factors and clinical expertise
8731785 i am excited to have every one of you with me on this new journey to bring educators clinicians and researchers together to explore massage and bodywork challenging confirming and broadening what we know and in the process educating ourselves in an interdisciplinary manner
8731786 the massage therapy profession needs research for only research can definitively tell us what massage therapy does and does not do how it does what it does and when and for whom it works
8731787 if one considers that the clinical practice patterns and outcomes of the future are products of todays educational programs and initiatives tamblyn rm 1996 then the importance of a reflective scholarly research and evidence informed approach to the education process and environment becomes clear

8731794 bike helmets are common sense bike helmets are not just for safety fanatics it is actually quite stupid to ride without them
8731795 bike helmets are common sense there isnt anyone for example who laughs at a motorist who puts on a seat belt
8731796 they are shockingly vague when they mention statistics it is without any reference to specific scientific studies and they merely wrap it all up in more arrogant rhetoric and tiring spin

8731798 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulphate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8731799 wrote dr fiona stanley of the telethon institute for child health research at the university of western australia in perth and caroline crowther of the australian research centre for health of women and babies in adelaide
8731800 better understanding is needed of factors that might influence the likelihood that offspring will benefit from maternal magnesium sulphate treatment such as the reason for imminent preterm birth the dose of magnesium sulphate and the timing of administration relative to birth and gestational age

8731804 by using outsourcing trust companies can focus on those things that they do best including providing a local presence for wealth management delivered by a trusted advisor
8731805 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8731806 we are pleased to be selling this distillery to the benriach distillery company ltd who will be able to give it the attention and commitment it deserves we currently have 13 operational malt distilleries including the recently re opened braeval distillery and we have also started significant expansion plans for the glenlivet distillery which is one of the top 15 priority brands of pernod ricard therefore our focus is to continue to develop and improve these distilleries

8731808 our seats were right behind the student section 2 rows up from the aisle
8731809 we have never seen and hope we do not see again the rude and vulgar students whom call themselves fans they would never sit down so we could see the game and their language was ugly as well as their behavior
8731810 they really spoiled the day for two people who drove 180 miles one way to attend the game
8731811 by the way in spite of being kicked in the back and ridiculed for asking them to stop using the f word we stayed for the whole game
8731812 it is an occasional decision just like this that convinces me that even former unl football coach and now unl athletics director tom osborne is not perfect and from time to time can make absolutely terrible decisions

8731820 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8731821 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8731822 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it just sounds not rational
8731823 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8731828 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8731829 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before august 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area
8731830 what we would like to see is a return to a place where we can have integration of russia into the international community unfortunately its russia that made the choice to take several steps backward in that regard

8731853 there was a mistake in a recipe for apple cake instead of calling for two pinches of nutmeg it said 20 nutmeg nuts were needed
8731854 we know that four adults ate one cake made from this recipe and they didnt feel well
8731855 at first we thought this would be enough because we didnt really think anyone would bake or eat this cake since so much nutmeg would give it a horrible bitter taste and because it is simply not that easy to get hold of that much nutmeg

8731858 the summers been slow delta had a whole terminal of those small regional jets and now theyve cut back a lot of those flights and its not just delta the airlines are getting killed by high fuel prices
8731859 for the first six months of the year we held up much better than many other destinations but were not immune to whats going on in the national economy
8731860 theres so much pressure on discretionary spending so much pressure for every dollar
8731861 well still have more available seats for the fall of 08 than we had in actual passengers in the fall of 07
8731862 and the vast majority of the cuts are with the small regional jets flying in from smaller markets most people in those markets can still drive to a larger city nearby and fly to orlando
8731863 and the people who come in are spending less the average sale used to be about 30 and now id say its more like 20
8731864 we have a lot of repeat customers and a lot of them are saying they are coming for one week instead of two
8731865 one guy from macon ga said he drove down last year for 60 and this year it cost 160 that 100 has to come out somewhere so he said theyd do one less day at disney
8731866 as we move into the fall things will slow down as they always do but we arent seeing a terrible fall off
8731867 we used to get 40 to 50 percent tourists and now its about 10 percent i heard on the news a lot of restaurants around here may close right now everything is staying afloat but just barely

8731869 at just 8mm thick our ultra thin display concept will enable the thinnest 32
8731870 our concept is also very light around 5 kg enabling a 32
8731871 weve managed to cut the size of the light guide which is the thickest part of an lcd from around 25mm to just 1mm
8731872 hence the thickest part of the display has now become one of the thinnest parts even thinner than the lc panel this has been key in achieving the sleek ultra thin design

8731923 the study has shown for the first time that metabolic response to brain tumor treatment can be detected earlier and faster by metabolic imaging instead of through structural imaging or assessment of the neurological status of a patient
8731924 frequent use of this type of imaging may be a useful tool to follow a patients response to chemotherapy for malignant brain tumors
8731925 it gives us the ability to identify treatment failure early and more time to alter a patients treatment plan before the disease progresses

8732062 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous
8732063 for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8732064 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8732065 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8732066 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8732067 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives
8732068 she was using language to get at what she wanted
8732069 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8732070 one of the things janni has affirmed and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand is the aspect of turn taking if there is anything universal in human language its turn of talk
8732071 the fact that panbanisha has done this and its accessible even to an untrained reviewer i think is an important aspect of her paper she has looked at the whole social action and the meaning ideational flow going back and forth is obvious
8732072 originally repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language
8732073 traditionally repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they dont have language its a kind of dichotomy or unfairness
8732074 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa
8732075 janni is an important part of the future and she will help carry ape language research further
8732076 voter fraud could have sweeping implications for state and national elections where in some states voter drives have added hundreds of thousands of new voters to the voter rolls

8732079 anytime you can face two of the best teams in the country early in the season it can only benefit you
8732080 were excited to represent the big 12 omaha is a great place to play volleyball and this will be a great kickoff to the season
8732081 for us to be in the showcase is as close to a final four atmosphere that you can create in the regular season
8732082 having our team play in that environment you find out where youre at and where you need to go this should be a learning experience
8732083 people wont think well be as good because of who we lost
8732084 but were a great program and i think we are gonna be good i think well surprise some people and opening the season playing stanford and usc it doesnt get any better than that
8732085 our goal every year is to reach the final four
8732086 our older players understand what a big deal it is having the final four in omaha as we get closer to that event there will be more hype and talk we want to be playing our best in december
8732087 i think there can be a carry over from the beach volleyball
8732088 our players trained twice a day and we got a lot out of it

8732091 the number of expensive physical models and prototypes can be radically reduced by cave and this ultimately saves a lot of time and money
8732092 furthermore the development process is significantly accelerated after all as designers we are working in 3 d anyway the new technology enables us to immediately discuss the different proposals and ideas with our colleagues from engineering or marketing and try things out
8732093 cave creates a quite different form of communication and cooperation
8732094 marketers designers and engineers can now deal with one issue simultaneously regardless of what comes up with me as a designer or engineer i am able to immediately try it and see if it works as everyone is seeing the same thing those people who are not directly involved in the process of development and construction can also immediately see the consequences and effects of decisions

8732227 inequities in health avoidable health inequities arise because of the circumstances in which people grow live work and age and the systems put in place to deal with illness
8732228 the conditions in which people live and die are in turn shaped by political social and economic forces

8732231 i just think he doesnt have the temperament to be president

8732233 there isnt a republican serving in the senate thats happy hes the nominee now theyre all supporting him but ill tell you they have told me ive had republican senators tell me they dont think theyll vote for him
8732234 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon
8732235 only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning
8732236 we see quite a few states where the number of schools selling junk food in vending machines is very low
8732237 in many places schools are substituting healthier choices and continuing to bring in revenue
8732238 it shows these changes are possible to make all states face the same economic challenges that lead schools to make money by selling junk food this dramatic progress made in states with strong leadership shows the other schools it can be done
8732239 its stunning where this election is going to be decided on

8732241 senator mccain has been wrestling with this condition on and off for a little over 4 years now
8732242 he usually functions well throughout the winter months with spring being his trouble season its really quite surprising to see him struggle this much in february
8732243 he just cant hold up out there any longer than 12 to 15 minutes
8732244 were to the point where were ready to try anything
8732245 have convinced themselves that obama is not honorable that he does not love his country as much as himself that makes it easier to justify doing whatever is necessary to defeat him especially if its done in the pursuit of honor

8732250 especially when youve been on them for 15 minutes 20 30 minutes an hour an hour and a half
8732251 youd come in the morning and youd sit at a desk like this youd be sitting until you go meet with clients or do interviews
8732252 you go meet clients for lunch wherever sitting you return here you sit you basically go through your day sitting and then go home shot because youre tired and youve been working all day long
8732253 i lost 20 pounds net weight i lost 25 26 pounds of fat
8732254 i always thought that you really had to work out hard if youre going to work out on a treadmill you had to workout at 5 mph or go running at 7 mph
8732255 ninety percent of the time my group is all sitting right here and were all working very closely together and im used to having larry or my team right here
8732256 im looking where are they ive got a question for them i have to get up and walk back and ask the question because i need an answer now it wasnt a huge deal but nonetheless i did notice it
8732257 i dont think it was designed to have to do that
8732258 if you combine the potential opportunity to help the health of the employee and save on health care combined with productivity gains do you want to pay for a treadmill desk or do you want to pay by not having a treadmill desk
8732259 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8732260 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8732261 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8732262 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8732263 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon

8732265 the wind blew them down quickly so we need to make some money quickly
8732266 this is a new line that i just picked up
8732267 people from downtown st paul just arent accustomed to having something other than like a macys or a traditional shopping experience
8732268 here what we have to offer is one of a kind pieces so it will probably just take some time for them to understand what they can find here
8732269 well i think its really nice that we fixed it up for em
8732270 it did get the park finally fixed up i dont think they would have done that for me or you
8732271 you can see where it drips on the sidewalk and could end up dripping on somebodys head
8732272 hell chase you around with his bucket hell have some beads strapped to it hell say hey ill sing you a song if you put a dollar in a bucket so stuff like that happens all the time
8732273 it is just going to be one week thats going to be packed up and then theyre going to say all right guys get out of here
8732274 after that week theyll be pretty tired we have a scandinavian population up here and they clean up and get everything up to normal theyll get it straight
8732275 after eight or 11 miles it reverts to being a completely normal gasoline electric hybrid which means you get about a 25 30 percent fuel savings but the point is they do burn fuel
8732276 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8732277 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8732278 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8732279 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8732280 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
8732281 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing
8732282 its very difficult for governments that have had a specific regulation on their books for many years to suddenly decide to change
8732283 on behalf of the great state of new york with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future with the spirit of unity lets declare all together with one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8732286 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8732287 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8732288 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8732289 were glad to see were in the forecast path because they never get it right this far out
8732290 i say that slightly tongue in cheek but its true
8732291 the build up of nato forces in the black sea area
8732292 russia clearly intended this as a blatant challenge to world order its now up to all of us to roll russian aggression back if they get away with this they will carry on they will also attack other countries in the neighborhood
8732293 we will be ready to make decisions including in the united nations on additional increases in the number of international monitors clarifying their mandate and possibly other steps with international participation
8732294 to initiate wide support for recognition is not a primary goal
8732295 were not going to twist anyones hands to make them support recognition
8732296 russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region we do not want a new cold war and he medvedev has a big responsibility not to start one
8732297 we are sorry about this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8732298 now we have people flexing their muscles demonstrating force we can only regret that

8732554 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8732555 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8732556 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8732557 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8732558 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8732559 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8732560 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
8732561 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8732562 a problem can crop up in just one instant and you dont realize its there until its too late
8732563 those international standards can be sometimes more stringent than provincial or territorial requirements
8732564 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8732565 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability
8732566 it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke
8732567 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8732568 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8732569 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8732570 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8732571 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8732572 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulphate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8732573 were thinking about how we can pass on this project to the next generation of students
8732574 having a student run organic garden on campus with its primary goal one of education about sustainable food systems is a tremendous complement to the universitys sustainability goals
8732575 for one it illustrates on a small scale the principles dining services is applying that affect all students on campus every day principles that stress local and sustainable production as well as human and environmental health
8732576 im getting a chance to work with the community of scholars at princeton with the local community and with insiders in the field
8732577 im gaining quite a bit of perspective on what it takes to get a project like this off the ground im cultivating a partnership with the slow food group on campus in addition to the high meadows funds were getting recognition and support from other places inside and outside the university

8732580 these patterns suggest that canadians have anxieties about the economy but are resisting becoming too fearful the fact that 17 think they will be worse off next year and 25 think they will be better off also is continuing evidence that most people are not seeing the wolf at the door finally to date the political consequences of the economic mood may seem modest but given the close nature of the national race between the conservatives and the liberals a few percentage points make a difference any evidence that pessimism may have peaked at least for the moment is good news for the harper conservatives
8732581 with the recent decline in the price of oil the prospect of lower gas prices may have reduced some of the price concerns of canadian consumers the influence of these price declines is reinforced by the uniformity of responses and consistent confidence levels across the country

8732598 the c f bond is difficult to transform into other bonds under mild conditions because it is inert and unreactive its a challenge to chemists
8732599 but we found a way to take a c f bond that you can do very little with and break it and convert it cleanly into something else at room temperature
8732600 conversion of pfcs remains a challenge and our research efforts are directed at designing even more active catalysts capable of pfc activation
8732601 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon
8732602 only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning
8732603 some of the practices that these folks hammered may provide alternative forms of understanding how to do low level sustainable development today
8732604 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8732605 if you find it in europe its a city if you find it somewhere else it has to be something else
8732606 they have quite remarkable planning and self organization more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8732607 this throws a wrench in all the models suggesting we are looking at primordial biodiversity
8732608 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8732609 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases
8732610 since the results are consistent with what we know about human transmission the work helps justify the control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies it also shows that blood from bse and scrapie infected sheep could be used effectively in non human experiments to answer important questions such as which blood components are most heavily infected and to develop much needed diagnostic tests
8732611 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8732612 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8732613 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8732614 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8732615 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
8732616 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
8732617 this study provides further evidence for darwins theory of natural selection by showing that environmental conditions can directly impact genes controlling physical traits that affect the survival of species
8732618 a silent mass extinction is occurring in our gt jan 26 2000 purdue university researchers have found that releasing a transgenic fish to the wild could damage native populations even to the point of gt
8732619 we hope to develop these techniques further and apply them to more volcanoes worldwide
8732620 potentially these techniques could extend our knowledge of volcanic recharge considerably as they can be applied to material erupted before volcanic monitoring was commonplace
8732621 we hope that what we find in the crystals in terms of timescales can be linked with phenomena such as earthquakes
8732622 if we can relate the timescales we measure to such events we may be able to say when we could expect a volcano to erupt
8732623 this is an exciting new method that will help us understand the timescales of fundamental volcanic processes driving eruptions

8732630 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8732631 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8732632 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8732633 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational

8732639 the message that has come from the russians is one that is tied to invading another country invading sovereign territory

8732685 about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need
8732686 this will be something that will be a little more nuts and bolts than what were accustomed to seeing from barack obama
8732687 hes going to definitely try to contrast his message and his programs with those of john mccain
8732688 were hearing his campaign is having second thoughts about doing this real big production because hes being dogged from his opponents that hes a rock star for those soaring speeches to packed houses
8732689 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8732690 this is the biggest moment since martin luther king in the civil rights movement for blacks in the united states so he cannot ignore kings speech
8732691 but at the same time i dont think he can overemphasize it because the key democratic group that he needs to win over are working class whites talking too much about the civil rights movement could alienate that crowd
8732692 what should have been a democratic cakewalk is not a democratic cakewalk
8732693 this convention was his chance to reintroduce himself to americans to portray himself as an all american man from an all american family somebody who will not betray the values of the voters that hes going for that hes not a lofty man with his head in the stars
8732694 i want to make the choice between myself and john mccain as clear as possible
8732695 you can talk all you want about policies and programs but thats not what people respond to
8732696 people respond when they are touched emotionally and thats what hes so good at its going to be very important in his speech tomorrow night that people get excited emotionally thats what they want from him
8732697 i keep thinking that maybe hes getting in over his head and this is too hard and its going to get to him but he surprises me and delivers every time
8732698 it is not only a threat to international security but a breach of it
8732699 the territory previously known in soviet times as south ossetia is completely cleansed of remnants of the georgian population
8732700 in my opinion the main ethnic cleansing was evident when georgia made an aggression against south ossetia
8732701 an additional factor that needs to be taken into account
8732702 i think both senator clinton and president clinton gave both compelling endorsements of barack obama but more importantly laid out the choice in this election
8732703 i think that for anyone watching and theres been a lot of people watching theres no question about who they believe would be the stronger commander in chief and the person best to get our economy back on track
8732704 we think these three nights have been very important and couldnt have gone better
8732705 i think barack obamas going to tell the american people tonight clearly the challenges we face and where hes going to lead the country
8732706 the truth is over the last six years john mccains gotten an awful lot wrong as relates to our foreign policy and barack obamas judgement has been dead on right
8732707 they locked themselves in a room for three days with five bottles of tequila and wrote the most offensive outrageous script ive ever read
8732708 ive just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented
8732709 this inability of course harmed our relations first of all intergovernmental
8732710 we expected the u s to intervene in the conflict and stop the aggressive actions of the georgian leadership
8732711 the u s administration not only failed to restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal action but the american side in fact trained and equipped the georgian army

8732716 its very very annoying the squirrels cant get past that they decide its a bad place to raise their young
8732717 they believe it can steal time can affect consumer behavior and can influence how autonomous children are
8732718 based on the interviews the surveys and the time use diaries it appears that those who do not watch television not only reject television in order to keep sex violence shallow news coverage and consumerism out of their lives but also to encourage family interaction their childrens independence and creativity and a wise use of their time
8732719 i was surprised to find that two large groups of non viewers were exceedingly different in many ways but shared commonalities regarding television
8732720 very strong opinions not only about television but also about those issues they saw as being associated with it such as politics and couple interaction
8732721 by researching families without television i think we learn a lot about the role of television in the lives of american families
8732722 i know this may sound counter intuitive but when we look closely at family interaction in the absence of tv we see the ways in which television has become an integral part of our lives

8732727 a donated organ can save a life but at whose expense will the organ trade lead to an economic allocation of resources where only those who can pay will stand a better chance of survival in receiving an organ transplant will an organ be treated like a commodity
8732728 is it fair to criminalize such social relationships where no third party is harmed when a social relationship is forged which gives a new lease of life to both the stakeholders then law ought not to step in to criminalize and punish such relationships
8732729 organ donation even if it involves valuable consideration may make life better for both parties who find no way out of problems of health or poverty if the state and the altruists cannot help the poor in overcoming their problems it ought not to raise more barriers for them

8732734 irradiation works by splitting chemical bonds in molecules with high energy beams to form ions and free radicals when sufficient critical bonds are split in organisms contaminating a food the organism is killed comparable bonds are split in the food ions are stable free radicals contain an unpaired electron and are inherently unstable and therefore reactive i am opposed to consuming irradiated food because of the abundant and convincing evidence in the referred scientific literature that the condensation products of the free radicals formed during irradiation produce statistically significant increases in carcinogenesis mutagenesis and cardiovascular disease in animals and man
8732735 missing from the comments so far is any discussion of what stanley kurtz talked about finding in his search of the archives one item he mentioned concerned an organization that applied for money to fund a program promoting the celebration of the juneteenth holiday apparently juneteenth is an event that began in 1865 to mark the end of slavery this request was approved and funds were provided from the annenberg money another request for money from an organization dedicated to improving math skills of its participants was turned down according to dr kurtz many other academically oriented applications were also rejected this information was taken directly from documents in the archive now i dont have a problem with people celebrating and remembering their cultural heritage but if your goal is to improve academic performance it seems funding programs to improve math skills would be far more important it is also apparent that senator obama was instrumental in determining which requests for grants were accepted and which were rejected his priorities in this example do little to inspire confidence in his message about hope for a better future

8732860 i dont view these statistics as a problem but a chance for gods name to be great among a generation that is spiritual but not religious
8732861 what we found is that young adults desire to do life together
8732862 they desire relational equity and community that goes beyond casual hellos they want to pour their lives into each other
8732863 it will be a failure if we raise a generation who are just friends growing in the likeness of christ is essential
8732864 what we found in our research is that young adults who are churched are saying if we are going to stand for truth in a world that is not standing for truth we want to be equipped
8732865 the unchurched are saying we are not going to make a decision at face value
8732866 our god is a never changing god yet he is constantly relevant
8732867 teach the whole bible foster discussion and answer the difficult questions of faith
8732868 offer quality exegetical bible teaching and sing theologically sound music that accurately depicts the word of god
8732869 for both church and unchurched young adults we have found that both recognize that their choices make a difference and they want to improve the world around them
8732870 as a result of this heightened sense of responsibility we can help create a door for service and evangelism
8732871 as we continue to understand younger adults and what theyre looking for we must recognize the heavy value they place on connecting with people who have more life experience than they do
8732872 some would call this mentoring or cross generational ministry the bottom line is that they want to learn from someone elses experiences theyre looking for a connection with the church and a connection with people who are willing to walk alongside them and give a little advice here and there
8732873 if an absence exists between what you say and what you do young adults will become quickly disinterested
8732874 if you desire for your church to be a healthy body that raises the banner of intergenerational ministry you need to personally invest in this generation as well
8732875 we have kids who may not believe in god but they are willing to come to social events or service events we want to keep a relationship with them anyway we can so they continue to hear the word of god
8732876 the responsibility aspect of young adult ministry does make sense
8732877 young adult ministry is not about wowing this generation with the latest shows but about allowing them to impact their world those who come to our church are extremely interested in supporting events that make the world a better place in providing opportunities to serve we ultimately hope nonbelievers will make decisions for christ

8732940 looking back at the custom bike world it was such a contrast it was almost nauseating so experiencing the performance world made me want to build a bike that could balance both worlds
8732941 about two years ago i planned this machine and built it to do things its like late 50s early 60s sort of caf racer crossed with modern custom sports bike but with modern techno harley and a lot of high tech thrown in this simple little sketch that i made on an airplane it was a bike that had a look to it it was also a look that no one had really delved into before
8732942 it runs just a front cylinder and where the cylinder of the v sits i run the supercharger harleys themselves are fun to work with but to take half of one was even a bigger challenge theres something fun in making a machine go fast that really is not supposed to i figured it would either be a grenade or wed get it to work quite well

8733162 as much as i am opposed to gambling in our state as much as i am concerned about the social ills that accompany gambling when it comes into our state as the attorney general my job is to enforce the law and to be sure whatever gambling we have is being conducted in strict accordance with the law
8733163 this is something that i dont think the people of alabama want they voted on it they voted on it time and time again there is always a person who will make a fortune off of it if it happens but that is not justification to allow an expansion of gambling in the state
8733164 if the citizens say they want it hes obligated to not go against the will of the people
8733165 mexicos supreme court voted 8 3 thursday to uphold legal abortion in the capital opening the possibility that similar measures could be adopted elsewhere in mexico and perhaps beyond

8733167 i cant afford to have a baby right now because my job is not stable we live with zorans parents because we dont have enough money to rent or to buy an apartment were going to wait a year or two just to see if the government is serious this time and after the money is guaranteed we can think about having babies
8733168 we spend around 250 euros a month for all the basic needs of my children like kindergarten food and clothes but as they grow up we need more money my mother helps me a lot for instance she buys books and all the necessary things for school for my son thats why i have to work in shifts and to do extra jobs
8733169 the government should provide free kindergarten free school books and give financial aid for university students also mothers must have free weekends and have a right to go home earlier than other employees what if the government fails with this project i cant stay at home and wait for help from the state
8733170 i thought writing about horses would make the pain worse
8733171 after a failed attempt at nanowrimo in 2005 i had no idea that deciding to try again in 2006 would be the decision that changed my life that november i was a nineteen year old senior at florida state university i was a full time student and a freelancer on the side id wondered if i could write a novel but i had no experience in book length fiction what would i write about then it hit me there was only one answer the topic id been avoiding for six years horses in 2000 at thirteen id needed a spinal fusion for severe scoliosis my spine had been shaped like an s and it had pressed on my heart and lungs after surgery i had to wait at least two years before riding horses but future riding came with a caveat if i rode and fell the wrong way i could snap the rod in my spine or become paralyzed the surgery had been excruciatingly tough and i didnt know if i could go through something like that again i stopped riding and tried to push away my deep love of horses but it never went away that passion and adoration of everything about the equestrian world gnawed at me i freelanced for dozens of magazines and wrote about everything but horses i thought writing about horses would make the pain worse then i couldnt fight it anymore my nanonovel for 2006 had to be about horses the idea wouldnt go away a small town girl leaves home to attend boarding school and try out for the advanced equestrian team does she have what it takes thirty days later id answered that question and had a rough so rough draft of my first young adult novel now what an agent seemed like the right answer i drafted a query and sent it to two agents the first was rejected the same day and the second agent requested a full while the full was in the mail i got an e mail from another agent it was january 4 2007 shed read my blog and requested my manuscript did agents really discover authors via blogs that sounded like something out of the writer after checking out the agency i sent the manuscript three weeks later i signed with alyssa eisner henkin and revisions began i enrolled in what i fondly dubbed revision boot camp and we changed the manuscript from young adult to middle grade my nanonovel went on submission in mid may 2007 and less than two weeks later it sold as part of a four book series to aladdin mix a tween line from simon amp schuster writing take the reins helped ease my longing to ride and it brought back my memories of being an active equestrian without nanowrimo i might have discarded my dreams of writing a horse book i blogged about my journey through nano that year and now i look back on my archived blog posts and smile those who doubt anything publishable can come from a months worth of over caffeinated writing are so wrong so ignore the naysayers and write your damn novel i was privileged enough to interview chris you know baty for an article for listen about nano the enthusiasm in his voice and the love he has for this project are infectious now im more obsessed with nano than ever ill be writing the third book in my canterwood crest series this fall but you can bet ill be nanoing along with my friends and fellow writers i cant wait to blog and vlog about this years nano and watch everyones word meters fill up cheers to all of my nano friends and heres to nanowrimo 2008
8733172 the intentions of this prayer are that citizens participate in an active and informed way in the elections
8733173 and that their voting choices are wise wisdom means that we see things from gods perspective put first things first and discern whats important and whats not one of the practical effects of such wisdom is that we realize that when the state fails to protect the right to life it ceases to be a true democracy and instead becomes a tyrant state
8733174 what ive heard consistently from my clients is we just need to know
8733175 there remain a number of differences in the details and the devil is in the details
8733176 having two different standard setting bodies working over time isnt a sustainable model
8733177 the essence is to lead people design is the embodiment of the right information at the right time
8733178 how do we make money is the obvious common language between business and design
8733179 it took me quite a while to understand i learned the hard way
8733180 they narrow the solutions for us and can translate between business and design articulating benefits
8733181 at this point their egos could be through the roof
8733182 but they wanted to understand who we are and work according to that
8733183 it allowed bloomberg to evolve without abandoning what made us successful
8733184 they arent afraid of the tenuous line between art and design
8733185 the company was very supportive especially in a situation where burnout is very possible
8733186 we didnt properly prepare ourselves so it took much longer for us to mesh with the community

8733188 our annual cork supply pet calendar is more than a fun way to mark the months and showcase our industrys adorable and sometimes unusual pets

8733190 i wanted to do my bit to realise it to the full
8733191 slow down pause and savor enjoy the bounty of the earth wrap yourself around family friends and your culinary heritage and know the source of your food plant utopia and harvest a new reality
8733192 for me preparing food planning a menu gathering my friends around the table serving fresh seasonal and locally produced food that is what slow food is all about
8733193 its about pausing to experience the flavors and appreciate the effort that the farmer has made to grow the food and how it was prepared
8733194 its definitely about eating seasonally but also cooking from scratch rather than packages
8733195 here in sacramento we are very blessed to have so many farmers markets where we can meet the farmers learn where the food was grown or produced its important to preserve and support that resource
8733196 we have belonged to several convivia and the sacramento group is one of the most active with a dedicated membership and wonderfully diverse meeting topics
8733197 we are quite willing to wait until august to eat tomatoes
8733198 rather than buy tomatoes imported from mexico we wait until the season begins again its also about cooking from scratch
8733199 we grow 37 types of tomatoes and we have several types of melons along with corn apricots peaches apples grapes carrots lettuce rhubarb strawberries eggplant broccoli tangerines and a lot more at one point this summer we were harvesting 50 melons a day
8733200 we carry them around in the trunk of the car offering them to people at the office friends family and neighbors the extras go to a food closet
8733201 when you grow what you eat of course you eat seasonally
8733202 and you learn to enjoy the change of seasons when you have to wait for a tomato to ripen the anticipation makes it worthwhile
8733203 with the combination of football and motorsport we wanted to create a race weekend format that was truly unique
8733204 our key focus is on providing excellent entertainment for the fans we didnt just want to copy what every other motor racing championship had to offer our championship will attract many fans who are completely new to motorsport and we wanted to ensure we provide a unique entertainment package
8733205 that is also why we have also placed a considerable emphasis on off track activities to provide great entertainment for all the family

8733212 helping to remove the fear and stigma that prevents people from learning their hiv status

8733214 primary health care which integrates health in all of governments policies is the best framework for doing so
8733215 central to the commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered to have freedom to lead flourishing lives
8733216 following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8733217 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8733218 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8733219 after 3 years of gathering evidence the commission on social determinants of health has performed an invaluable service in making the health case for a fairer society it is a case that deserves the full support of health professionals and policymakers in all countries at last equity is taking its rightful place at the centre of public debate about health the commissions report is a fitting tribute to dr j w lee whos late director general who initially commissioned this brave project

8733221 the rules and applications for the 2009 eurovision song contest have not even been sent out yet so the buzz about broadcasters withdrawing is premature in my opinion every year we see broadcasters reconsidering their participation for a broad range of reasons which is their full right we are happy to see though that in a solid majority of the cases broadcasters are very loyal to the eurovision song contest
8733222 every year the contest is being evaluated by the reference group suggestions from ebu members and viewers as well as figures are being taken into consideration that might lead to changes but not for the sake of change alone it is improvement that should be the foundation of change the need to change depends on the possibility to improve and that is not always so simple as it looks should anything be improved for next year s contest you will most likely find out before the end of the year
8733223 i have not seen the forms myself yet so i would have to pass here
8733224 we never publish the evaluation forms from ebu members after the eurovision song contest
8733225 every year the ebu introduces changes in the format either minor or major ones i can say it is most likely that also in 2009 we will see changes but as i said only for the sake of improvement and not for the sake of change alone if that also involves changes in the voting for the final it is yet to be decided dont forget that in essence the voting system used in the final is already successfully in use for decades we are proud of that and it is well known across europe again by the end of the year you will know more
8733226 that people live in countries which they would not consider their natural homeland is the result of history the trend of globalization will only increase that that is the reality of the world we live in but we cannot and should not ask people for their passport when they vote not to speak about the practical implications dedicated people vote with dedication and you can sometimes see that in the results if others believe with the same dedication another song should win i hope they will vote with the same dedication as well with televoting the excitement is truly in the hands of the viewers all viewers

8733232 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves

8733246 when i went to take my quarter master sommelier exam i was one of two women in the room out of forty people
8733247 i have an idea about how i feel about wine and i want to make it as accessible and as friendly and as passionate as possible i think that theres a new wave of that idealism in the industry and its being shared by a lot of younger sommeliers they want to make it fun for people because wine can be such an exhausting and an overwhelming subject
8733248 people take a look at my wine list and theyre like oh my god so i try to make it as unintimidating as possible i dont know if thats a woman thing or not but i feel like its my approach and i seem to feel it more and more out there
8733249 when people become enamored with wine it helps everybody in the industry
8733250 its refreshing and crisp and it has a little bit of a body so it goes well with food and oregon has a plethora of pinot noir ros s that are dry a lot of people have the impression that ros s are sweet and there are world class really dry crisp ros s that are just like having a really amazing white wine with a little bit different flavor and if you think about the food thats available right now you have all this beautiful fresh produce theres nothing better than sitting in the sun with fresh vegetables and a glass of ros
8733251 we took two vans full of food and wine to the airport we had nine cases of wine and we had to maneuver it through manhattan to the hotel room we had stuff on ice in the room and then we had to maneuver it to the james beard house we were so glad it all made it
8733252 it was such an honor to walk into this place where some of the most amazing chefs in the world have worked
8733253 wine is the kind of thing where the more you learn about it the more you realize that you need to search more theres always more to learn because wine is a living thing and every year there are more vintages from different regions around the world and there are new regions and new producers all over the world constantly so you have to keep up on that constantly constant education

8733337 the study has shown for the first time that metabolic response to brain tumor treatment can be detected earlier and faster by metabolic imaging instead of through structural imaging or assessment of the neurological status of a patient
8733338 frequent use of this type of imaging may be a useful tool to follow a patients response to chemotherapy for malignant brain tumors

8733350 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
8733351 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans
8733352 are exciting because they establish a spatial link between recent gullies and accumulation of glacier ice strengthening the case for surface melt water flow in the formation of gullies on mars
8733353 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8733354 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke
8733355 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8733356 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8733357 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8733358 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8733359 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
8733360 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
8733361 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous
8733362 for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8733363 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8733364 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8733365 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8733366 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives
8733367 she was using language to get at what she wanted
8733368 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8733369 one of the things janni has affirmed and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand is the aspect of turn taking if there is anything universal in human language its turn of talk
8733370 the fact that panbanisha has done this and its accessible even to an untrained reviewer i think is an important aspect of her paper she has looked at the whole social action and the meaning ideational flow going back and forth is obvious
8733371 originally repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language
8733372 traditionally repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they dont have language its a kind of dichotomy or unfairness
8733373 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa

8733424 we had initially contemplated a written report but mr lee announced his retirement before that report was produced
8733425 involved the operations and management of the department there were a variety of issues i was looking at
8733426 expressed to me concerns that this was a foregone conclusion that this was a witch hunt and so on
8733427 i worked very hard to be as objective as i could be so if it came to a point where decisions were going to be made it could be done in the most fair way possible
8733428 terry and rick made their decisions about retirement for their own reasons
8733429 and where we go from here remains to be seen

8733431 i think about bright yellow daisies and daffodils petunias and all kinds of posies
8733432 i wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world
8733433 or the greedy and swindlers or idolaters since then you would need to go out of the world
8733434 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
8733435 the black list project was conceived of by photographer filmmaker timothy greenfield sanders with elvis mitchell public radio host and former new york times film critic
8733436 yes there are so many things that we want to do more than we can do with the resources so when london studio was looking at the early work on eyepet and the prototype of eight days they knew they couldnt do all of them and there are even more things theyre working on at early concept stage
8733437 london studio is really best placed for showing how these things can be done because theyve worked on games in that space for many years they know how consumers are going to react how to make it accessible and fun
8733438 go ahead and write a blog about it but you know you cant really do that right
8733439 ive started a new project its big its like look at our line up and imag ine something even bigger kind of big im directing it myself i cant mention it publicly yet when you find out what this is youll likely agree that i cant oversell this one
8733440 current congestion and safety for motorists pedestrians and bicyclists are the main concerns
8733441 the end result will be a safer and easier accessible stretch of road for everyone
8733442 ill probably take side streets whenever possible when driving to work to avoid as much construction as possible
8733443 that might use a little extra gas but it will be worth it not to have to deal with the aggravation
8733444 i watch people turn left out of our parking lot every day and most people cut it very close
8733445 if they cant turn left there wont be as many accidents
8733446 trying to turn across traffic from a lane or trying to get across traffic from any of the plazas is a bit nerve wracking
8733447 i think the medians and the u turn lanes will be helpful
8733448 the construction was not the main cause for the store closing but it was certainly a factor
8733449 it had a substantial impact on the number of customers that wanted to deal with the construction and come to our store i am nervous that the same thing will happen again
8733450 we are trying to make this a public process by working with businesses that will be affected by the construction
8733451 we hope that they will see the overall picture with the end result being easier access to their stores for customers
8733452 even though the end result of the construction might mean less accidents and possibly more customers trying to survive two years in this economy is going to be very difficult

8733513 i wanted to make the film and the facts about the occupation of iraq accessible to a larger group of people my hope is that this will contribute to the process of making better foreign policy decisions moving forward in iraq and elsewhere during this election year it s important to examine the leadership mentality and policies that caused iraq to descend into such a horrific state that after 4 000 american deaths at least a quarter million iraqis killed 4 million refugees and over 2 trillion spent iraq remains in a state of near collapse

8733515 with drivers hitting the road this weekend and gas prices through the roof the last thing new york city drivers need are gas stations hitting them with exorbitant prices for paying with a credit card
8733516 drivers across new york city need to be on the guard for gas stations that engage in deceptive practices to squeeze every last dollar out of their customers our investigation revealed that new york city is rife with gas stations that engage in deceptive practices where they display one price as a way to lure customers and then charge them more at the pump
8733517 the aaa commends attorney general cuomo for undertaking this initiative aaa is a proud partner in this fight his warning to the stations engaging in this deceptive act is a welcome service to drivers who desperately need relief at the gas pump
8733518 these cases and outbreaks serve as a reminder that measles can and still does occur in the united states
8733519 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
8733520 the vaccine against measles is highly effective in preventing infections and high immunization levels in the community are effective at preventing or drastically decreasing the size of outbreaks
8733521 we want to make sure that motorists arent being shaken down at the pump too there are limits to how much stations on the thruway can charge our audit will look at whether or not those limits are being adhered to
8733522 anyone who drives the thruway knows gas prices are higher and motorists are forced to pay those prices
8733523 and the thruway should post the prices from every rest stop on its web site so drivers can make informed decisions about where to buy their gas
8733524 as far as we know russia has taken no official action to either reduce imports of u s products or restrict imports from specific u s poultry plants we have been in touch with our government today and we have been told that russia has initiated no contact on any of these issues

8733526 there is very long history of russia using health standards at plants to curb imports
8733527 on issues relating to the vice president that obviously is a decision for the mccain campaign
8733528 a disaster for all concerned and especially for the gop
8733529 i think the american people know that john mccain is going to do whats right for the country
8733530 hes been doing it his entire lifetime hes going to pick someone with principle and someone who can be a partner in governing
8733531 governor romney would help shore up mccains perceived lack of economic experience
8733532 also romney strategically helps as far as the states of michigan new hampshire and the mountain states like colorado new mexico and nevada that have been viewed in play as well
8733533 all the mccain folks need to say is look what the alternative will be and that will scare up the base

8733651 there are two schools of thought on co morbidity of depression and parkinsons
8733652 one is that the onset of depression precedes and possibly leads to parkinsons the other is that parkinsons disease predisposes for depression clinically theres evidence for both of those lines of thinking
8733653 were going to have some groups that undergo depression first then the parkinsons and then well do the reverse
8733654 then there will be some that are combined depression then parkinsonism then further depression
8733655 so stress induced depression exacerbates problems with movement and also causes the relevant brain cells to die faster
8733656 well we do but there are no really definitive epidemiological studies or long term assessments of the effects of antidepressants on the progression of parkinsons
8733657 not only could they reduce depression but they might actually protect dopamine cells in the brain and thus slow the progression of parkinsons
8733658 were gratified that an investment in our research by the local community and the davis phinney foundation has now led to a five year nih grant that will allow us to investigate how stress causes enhanced parkinsonian symptoms and how to prevent stress from causing further damage to the parkinsonian brain

8733671 this was ok one over is by no means out of this tournament
8733672 this could cause liquidity to dry up because who wants to buy if they can only pay a higher price
8733673 risk appetite is low and investors are avoiding markets where there is political instability
8733674 direct intervention in market movements would lead to further complications as we have seen in the recent past
8733675 it will not be for the weak at heart i assure you
8733676 our schedule last year was strong but it does not compare with this season
8733677 the opening five games will be in a word challenging
8733678 we had to get creative this year with the dr pepper

8733682 misano is weird it used to be great i liked it the way it was it was a left left left kind of a dirt track style its hard once youve done something one way and then you try to change your mind and say ok now youre running it backward you always tend to find the faults when youre running it backward but its ok its kind of a little go kart track its just in a nice location
8733683 i had hoped my progress would be quicker i still need crutches at this stage but unless something goes south i definitely plan on trying to ride ive been seeing doctors and im going to get something molded to wear in my boot ive been doing some training in the pool and a few things at the gym nothing too crazy misano is almost a laguna without the hills its a tight little scrappy track where you need a bike you can be aggressive with i enjoyed it last year but id just as soon they flipped it back around and go the old direction for those big lefts that used to go on to the back straightaway i remember seeing the old 500s guys riding those on tv
8733684 we had a positive weekend in brno following my return to the track after a long absence through injury and we managed to put the kawasaki on the front row although i didnt quite achieve the result we were hoping for anthony west got into the top five which just shows that the kawasaki is improving all of the time and is capable of gaining good results i really enjoy the misano circuit i managed to get on the podium there last year so its certainly a track i like ive spent the last week in miami resting and training just to give the injuries that i am still carrying the best possible time to recuperate so im feeling stronger and ready to achieve the results we are more than capable of
8733685 im certainly excited to be getting back out there with the boys because i hated missing brno ive been doing all the old voodoo stuff they tell you to do bone stimulators lasers ultrasound all that stuff im doing everything possible to get back

8733706 naa levels of the right and left hippocampi were lower in the patients compared to controls
8733707 another statistically significant difference was observed in choline levels in the right hippocampus which were higher in the patient group
8733708 the hippocampus was dysfunctional in patients with fibromyalgia as shown by lower naa levels
8733709 the study has shown for the first time that metabolic response to brain tumor treatment can be detected earlier and faster by metabolic imaging instead of through structural imaging or assessment of the neurological status of a patient
8733710 frequent use of this type of imaging may be a useful tool to follow a patients response to chemotherapy for malignant brain tumors
8733711 it gives us the ability to identify treatment failure early and more time to alter a patients treatment plan before the disease progresses
8733712 one is that they dont know how to walk not walking they become deconditioned and lose cardiovascular fitness with the treadmill type of training you improve walking and also increase fitness
8733713 the most important clinical aspect of the study is that it is saying recovery can occur long after a stroke and can occur even after all the routine therapies have been tried
8733714 scientifically the most important point appears to be that rewiring of the brain may be involved in this process not just body conditioning
8733715 the average stroke patient now has about eight physical therapy sessions over six to 12 weeks
8733716 should be part of standard treatment for every stroke survivor who has a walking habit
8733717 most physical therapy departments have treadmills but they dont use them to the extent that we used them in the study
8733718 because this is exhausting it should always be done under supervision
8733719 there is always the risk of running into heart problems and falling we used special treadmills with handrails and also monitored the heart rate to achieve the level of exertion we needed
8733720 we want to know how the brain areas that encode memory are organized
8733721 if your memory is affected by aging or alzheimers disease is there a way to learn that can capitalize on the brain structures that may still be working well
8733722 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings
8733723 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8733724 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position
8733725 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous
8733726 for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8733727 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8733728 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8733729 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8733730 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives
8733731 she was using language to get at what she wanted
8733732 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8733733 one of the things janni has affirmed and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand is the aspect of turn taking if there is anything universal in human language its turn of talk
8733734 the fact that panbanisha has done this and its accessible even to an untrained reviewer i think is an important aspect of her paper she has looked at the whole social action and the meaning ideational flow going back and forth is obvious
8733735 originally repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language
8733736 traditionally repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they dont have language its a kind of dichotomy or unfairness
8733737 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa
8733738 there are two schools of thought on co morbidity of depression and parkinsons
8733739 one is that the onset of depression precedes and possibly leads to parkinsons the other is that parkinsons disease predisposes for depression clinically theres evidence for both of those lines of thinking
8733740 were going to have some groups that undergo depression first then the parkinsons and then well do the reverse
8733741 then there will be some that are combined epression then parkinsonism then further depression
8733742 so stress induced depression exacerbates problems with movement and also causes the relevant brain cells to die faster
8733743 well we do but there are no really definitive epidemiological studies or long term assessments of the effects of antidepressants on the progression of parkinsons
8733744 not only could they reduce depression but they might actually protect dopamine cells in the brain and thus slow the progression of parkinsons

8733746 the false suggestion of a childhood event can lead to persistent false beliefs that have lasting behavioural consequences studies on false memories and beliefs have compellingly shown that misleading information can lead to the creation of recollections of entire events that have not occurred
8733747 until now however no one has examined the possible effects of false memories on behaviour we asked ourselves can false beliefs be sufficiently strong to alter behaviour if one develops false memories in the laboratory might they have an influence on ones short and long term attitudes and actions
8733748 interestingly these participants showed a distinct change in attitudes and behaviour towards this food even some time afterwards
8733749 they not only rated egg lower than other foods but they avoided egg salad sandwiches altogether
8733750 with obesity levels reaching epidemic proportions around the world we could use this type of suggestive therapy for treating cases of obesity or influencing dieting choices it may be possible for people to learn to avoid certain foods by believing they had negative experiences with the food as a child
8733751 our study is the first ever to show that false memories can be so persuasive that people change their behaviour both in the short and longer term we have clearly demonstrated that false suggestions about childhood events can profoundly change peoples attitudes and behaviour in adulthood
8733752 mr hill what an honor it has been to meet someone like you who has won so many championships great races endurance races and so on

8733755 the act places restriction on the availability and visibility of alcohol and provides for more effective enforcement to deal with the consequences of alcohol abuse the introduction of fixed penalty charges for offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct will not only lead to more efficient use of public resources but hopefully will also support more responsible behaviour on the part of those concerned

8733760 during her schmaltzy speech at the democratic national convention michelle obama dogmatically recited the need to transform the world as it is to the world as it should be she and her husband have been working on a central plan to better the world alas changing george obamas fortunes is not in the blueprints how about some ill fitting hand me downs at least as hard as it is to lend spiritual credibility to michelles hubristic insolence those with messianic complexes like hers might contemplate the jewish concept of tikkun olam it sounds grandiose it means repairing the world but it was intended as a humble and modest thing it is the duty of the individual to help bit by bit to bring about a better world through unassuming day to day righteous acts the idea of charity is to improve society not the state and to do so through personal not political acts
8733761 the only thing our opponents can do that we care about is die
8733762 there are two schools of thought on co morbidity of depression and parkinsons
8733763 one is that the onset of depression precedes and possibly leads to parkinsons the other is that parkinsons disease predisposes for depression clinically theres evidence for both of those lines of thinking
8733764 were going to have some groups that undergo depression first then the parkinsons and then well do the reverse
8733765 then there will be some that are combined depression then parkinsonism then further depression
8733766 so stress induced depression exacerbates problems with movement and also causes the relevant brain cells to die faster
8733767 well we do but there are no really definitive epidemiological studies or long term assessments of the effects of antidepressants on the progression of parkinsons
8733768 not only could they reduce depression but they might actually protect dopamine cells in the brain and thus slow the progression of parkinsons
8733769 were gratified that an investment in our research by the local community and the davis phinney foundation has now led to a five year nih grant that will allow us to investigate how stress causes enhanced parkinsonian symptoms and how to prevent stress from causing further damage to the parkinsonian brain

8733777 i attempted to get up to use the restroom rather urgently during the 7th inning stretch as god bless america was beginning
8733778 as soon as the latter came out of my mouth my right arm was twisted violently behind my back and i was informed that i was being escorted out of the stadium
8733779 i was sitting in the tier level and of course this is the highest level of the stadium and i was escorted in this painful manner down the entire length of the stadium
8733780 when we reached the exit of the stadium they confiscated my ticket and the first officer shoved me through the turnstiles saying get the hell out of my country if you dont like it
8733781 nowhere on the yankee stadium ticket policy nor on any posted sign does it say that forced patriotism is a required element to attend a baseball game nowhere in the laws of this country would that begin to be defensible
8733782 furthermore when the two officers returned to their section steve who was still in the stadium overhead one of the officers say we got to watch ourselves
8733783 i do not believe in god nor am in support of this country to a degree of patriotic fanaticism the fact that i wanted to use the restroom instead of standing through god bless america should not be grounds for a forcible ejection from a baseball game
8733784 this tip doesnt surprise me at all everyone has to stand just like in school and youll get berated and harassed if you dont

8733967 i am always surprised at all the things people read into my photos but it also amuse me that may be because i have nothing specific in mind when im working my intentions are neither feminist nor political i try to put double or multible meanings into my photos which might give rise to a greater variety of interpretations

8733974 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8733975 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8733976 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8733977 hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8733978 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8733979 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player i think hes matured greatly through this he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine

8733998 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things

8734000 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
8734001 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
8734002 now i missed a few years of the cold war as the guest of one of our adversaries
8734003 obama talks about his service as a community organizer neither we nor the press begrudge him that and john gets to tell his story of service why anyone would argue he shouldnt is beyond me
8734004 my public profile is inextricably linked to my pow experiences obviously such recognition has benefited my political career and i am grateful for that
8734005 but i have tried to make what use i can of vietnam and not let the memories of war encumber the rest of my lifes progress neither have i been content to accept that my time in vietnam would stand as the ultimate experience of my life

8734013 i dont think since brown v board of education in 1954 will there be one singular moment that will make a bigger difference in race relations in this country than when on november the 4th we elect barack obama
8734014 the story is set in 1949 in the fictional capital city of teito where aristocrats monopolize most of the wealth k 20 a mysterious man with the ability to change his appearance frequently targets the rich for his theft one day he manages to trick police into thinking a circus acrobat named heikichi endo takeshi kaneshiro is the real criminal leaving it up to endo to escape jail and prove his innocence meanwhile k 20 targets his next victim yoko hashiba takako matsu an heiress whose fianc is kogoro akechi toru nakamura the famous detective who arrested endo but endo still has a score to settle and picks a fight with k 20
8734015 there was a huge amount of negative feedback by a lot of passionate clinton supporters
8734016 in my opinion the reason is because weve known hillary clinton for years she has been the first lady of arkansas a neighboring state so we have known her for a long long time
8734017 the opposite is true as well if we dont know you we have a tendency to be a little bit stand offish
8734018 i have had a personal relationship with barack obama in that he came to kentucky and supported me during my 04 us senate race
8734019 so ive gotten to know him and i know the type of person he is
8734020 i believe that barack obama will be a pivotal figure in the future of our country
8734021 he is a man of character and great judgment and for me it is a no brainer
8734022 i dont think since brown v board of education in 1954 will there be one singular moment that will make a bigger difference in race relations in this country than when on november the 4th we elect barack obama
8734023 we are challenging ontarios political leaders to commit to modern energy solutions that can be deployed today to shut down nanticoke by 2012
8734024 nuclear power is a dangerous distraction that wont shut down nanticoke for another decade or help canada meet its kyoto targets

8734038 subsequent investigations led to the arrest of a 53 year old jindabyne man at cooma yesterday afternoon
8734039 the man was taken to cooma police station for questioning where he was later charged with murder
8734040 investigators will today make further inquiries into the recovery of the womans body
8734041 police will allege the woman was greeted by a 74 year old man who entered the home and then assaulted the woman with a weapon before proceeding to the bathroom and assaulting the wheelchair bound man
8734042 as a result of the incident the man and woman both sustained multiple stab wounds to their backs heads and chests
8734043 in all nations that have discussed abortion in constitutional courts there is a before and an afterwards
8734044 in mexico the afterwards is now beginning the legal and social impact of this decision are undeniable
8734045 maintains the stability and public confidence in the nations financial system by insuring deposits supervising financial institutions and managing receiverships
8734046 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8734047 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8734048 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it just sounds not rational
8734049 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8734053 the humanitarian needs of conflict victims and those displaced by recent violence in georgia
8734054 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8734055 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before august 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area

8734191 daarentegen weten we over deze ploegen ook niet heel veel we zullen op pad moeten om de tegenstanders te bekijken
8734192 we moeten nu opeens niet moeilijk gaan doen over een loting we zien het wel we wisten wat ons te wachten kon staan
8734193 there are a lot of white voters out there some of them union members who think that hes the wrong race
8734194 as democrats we cant tap dance around the fact that there are some faces out there just like that woman
8734195 theyre scared to death they want change they need change but they just cant get past the notion that voting for a black man named barack obama is the only way to do that
8734196 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
8734197 what we have is a distribution problem the only way out of this is to put more money in the hands of those consumers and have them lead us out of this
8734198 if we take it a piece at a time there are things we can do reasonably quickly

8734211 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8734212 the people of america need to put aside their differences and come together on common ground especially at this crucial moment in our history how better i ask to achieve this goal than to engage in an inconclusive protracted ignorant and superficial examination of the issue of race over the past 20 years our country has become intensely polarized the gap between rich and poor has grown ever more vast voters on both sides are desperate for alternatives if we ever hope to move into a new era of enlightened multicultural exchange we must foster on a national scale a second grade level look into the most painful and difficult issue in americas cultural history black white yellow green or brown we can all be callously summed up in a trite statement of unity

8734216 the burner will an event that lives up to that tradition angel fires trails are among the fastest and most technically challenging in north america a fact the top riders in the world can testify to after the uci world cup held here in 2005 this will be an extreme challenge to find out whos the toughest
8734217 angel fire has hosted plenty of high profile mountain bike events in the past few years including the uci world cup collegiate nationals us nationals and mountain states cup events
8734218 but weve never hosted an evening gravity event or endurance downhill its definitely going to be an amazing scene to watch we hope to mark this event as a do not miss end of season dh mountain bike tradition for years to come much like the 24 hours of moab has become on the endurance side

8734240 hemos dialogado sobre este tema y estamos de acuerdo de que el art culo 67 de la constituci n vigente determina que no se puede hacer proselitismo en el interior de las instituciones educativas
8734241 el se or rector puede hacer invitaciones lo que no puede es asegurar la presencia del presidente
8734242 nosotros tenemos entendido que el presidente estar afuera del pa s el d a s bado de tal manera que eso no va a ocurrir y nos deja una gran tranquilidad en el sentido de que no van a producirse ning n tipo de actos que atenten a la seguridad de los estudiantes
8734243 yo no estoy haciendo ning n tipo de proselitismo los carteles fueron puestos por los padres de familia en gratitud a las obras que el gobierno est haciendo en las instituciones educativas

8734270 ich habe vor neun jahren mitgespielt und wir hatten vorher vielleicht nicht ganz die bedeutung der partie begriffen wir hatten am dienstag davor und am montag danach jeweils ein ligaspiel die uns wichtiger erschienen aber das ist dieses mal nicht der fall und deshalb gibt es keine ausreden wir m ssen rausgehen und das spiel gewinnen es ist ein pokal den viele von uns noch nie gewonnen haben das ist eine gro e motivation f r uns
8734271 es ist in jeder saison eine gro e herausforderung den titel zu gewinnen aber mit unserem kader sind wir im angriff nur sehr schwer ausrechenbar
8734272 in nachbetrachtung der letzten saison war es ausschlaggebend dass wir so viele spieler hatten die im angriff ein spiel alleine entscheiden konnten
8734273 wir haben einen jungen kader und es gibt keinen grund warum wir es nicht schaffen sollten erst durch den gewinn der liga und der champions league darf man an solchen wettbewerben teilnehmen und darauf freuen wir uns wir wollen jedes spiel gewinnen und um dies zu schaffen m ssen wir als geschlossene mannschaft auftreten wir haben das in den letzten zwei jahren konstant geschafft und jetzt m ssen wir es auch in dieser saison hinbekommen wenn wir weiterhin gute leistungen abrufen gibt es keinen grund warum wir nicht erfolgreich sein sollten

8734281 i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation
8734282 mr deeb hasnt actually violated any law or regulation that i can find but i dont like what hes doing because im ignorant and irrationally afraid of chemicals so ill abuse my power to steal his property and shut him down
8734283 pamela a wilderman marlboro s code enforcement officer said mr deeb was doing scientific research and development in a residential area which is a violation of zoning laws
8734284 allow me to translate ms wildermans plain english words into plain english
8734285 there are regulations about how much you re supposed to have how it s detained how it s disposed of
8734286 mr deeb s home lab likely violated the regulations of many state and local departments although officials have not yet announced any penalties
8734287 i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation
8734288 if you like chemistry study it and get a real job involving it
8734289 i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation
8734290 a house is not a home unless it contains food and fire for the mind as well as the body
8734291 mixing houshold chemicals could easily cause mass health problems if the proper equipment is not in place
8734292 these laws are in place for a reason to prevent major loss of life in the case of unkown sic chemical danger
8734293 deeb actually put the lives of the firefighters at stake by not having material safety data sheets ready for the fire department
8734294 i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation
8734295 uh dar we called in the biohazard level 18 nuclear containment group cause we dont know our collective asses from a hole in the ground and as government workers we love overtime
8734296 i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation

8734298 blow out walls flame detection smoke detection and a deluge sprinkler system
8734299 because mr deeb is described as a retired chemist it seems safe to presume that he has decades of professional experience under his belt and that he knows exactly how chemicals work and exactly the contents and safety of his lab

8734323 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8734324 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured

8734332 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day
8734333 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
8734334 i think there is a danger children are losing skills because adults are being exposed to mapping that is a second rate product
8734335 people are scared of maps and they should not be anyone who has the intelligence to get on the internet and work out where they are going surely has the ability to look at a map and see what the symbols mean
8734336 sat navs and other gadgets help people but map reading is a skill people should have
8734337 you do not need to pick up a paper to hear about people being routed the wrong way by sat nav
8734338 people who are into walking and hiking will always understand traditional maps but if you just want to find your way to a new pub you do not need to know how to read those maps
8734339 were moving towards a future where interactive maps will display precisely the information people want when they want it its adding a whole new dimension literally to cartography now anyone can create their own maps or use their experiences to collaborate with others in charting their local knowledge

8734359 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8734360 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8734361 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent

8734380 the scrapbook industry has changed rapidly in the last five years
8734381 digital scrapbooking and photobooks have become very popular ways to preserve your memories the majority of scrapbookers have digital cameras and for some of them it makes more sense to print a photobook rather than individual photos retailers in the traditional scrapbook industry have struggled to figure out how to capitalize on this trend the photobookbiz program is the answer to that question
8734382 we are very pleased to be partnering with scrapbiz com in helping people tell their stories and creating a new way to generate revenue through digital scrapbooking
8734383 the developing world is poorer than we thought but no less successful in the fight against poverty

8734386 we look forward to serving the far rockaway five towns community and to our new relationship with kosherworld
8734387 for kosherworld to offer this convenience to far rockaway consumers is in line with the community service that they are known to have
8734388 the manager is actively involved in hatzolah in a role as a liaison of the jewish community to the local police department and is very helpful in other community matters as well
8734389 assisted with the governments investigation of scores of other persons who have not yet been charged

8734400 the message that has come from the russians is one that is tied to invading another country invading sovereign territory
8734401 has a lot of us concerned about what it means now what it means a year from now what it means long term with our relationship on the military military side as well as the relationship between our two countries
8734402 certainly there is potential there because physically the russian navy is operating in the black sea so is the united states navy
8734403 weve worked hard over many years to figure out ways to both operate together operate around each other we know how to do that and i believe well continue to do that safely
8734404 expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8734405 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be
8734406 were trying to figure out how that fits into bringing pressure onto that border to minimize the cross border operations from pakistan
8734407 france notes that president abdallahi has not been released and that the constitutional order resulting from the elections of march 2007 has not been restored
8734408 in these circumstances france is ready to take individual sanctions measures against the main leaders of the junta
8734409 we are now considering personal sanctions against military and civilian personnel who are an obstacle to the return of constitutional order
8734410 we have not got to any such level of detail nor do we want to get to any such level of detail we do not want to apply a single sanction to mauritania but we may be obliged to
8734411 nigeria is never entering into any agreement with iran for any matter that has to do with weapons but will agree to power which is an urgent need of the nigerian government
8734412 we not only consider it nuclear energy an iranian inalienable right but also nigerias right to use this clean source of energy
8734413 nobody can limit the use of this knowledge anywhere in the world
8734414 that building was contaminated with asbestos they started demolishing this building without notification to area residents weve had our windows shut for a month and a half the only thing this community got was a con job
8734415 the careful planning in connection with the remediation and demolition of the obsolete and antiquated kent ave plant has been ongoing for some time and is being carefully carried out
8734416 i went to the site the other day clearly theres a lot of dust and particles in the air one of the workers came out coughing
8734417 the question is do they have more than an annoyance or a health hazard
8734418 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8734419 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8734420 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8734421 the wind blew them down quickly so we need to make some money quickly
8734422 too deep of a correction i believe this is the bottom we will see
8734423 there is a hugely beneficial extortion system going on here the party needs these companies to sponsor these events to contribute to the festive atmosphere and the companies cant afford to say no since theyre looking at big issues coming up against them next year
8734424 it is an opportunity for them to build relationships or just to confirm good relationships with members of congress
8734425 we get quite a lot of check ins prior to hurricanes and also immediately after a hurricane because we do pretty well during a hurricane
8734426 i lost my entire family theyre all dead there i have seven dead there
8734427 not even the same organization it was three years ago

8734429 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8734430 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8734431 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8734432 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8734433 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8734434 i dont know how i can live now because none of my family is left

8734436 emergency in nature and required to protect people from imminent exposure to danger or damage
8734437 weve been working hard toward this for years and throughout have been told it has a life of 20 years
8734438 the bridge has been rated as one of the worst
8734439 i just hope that people will be relieved that we are finally starting this
8734440 am i concerned no i feel great about this opportunity
8734441 we want to open up the convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party
8734442 the question for obama is what have you done and what have you run
8734443 he has good oratory but when you shut off the teleprompter theres not much there
8734444 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8734445 hes going to lay out a case for change hes going to set the stakes of this election the risks of continuing down the road were on which is plainly what senator mccain is offering
8734446 he has just been admitted for abdominal discomfort investigation will commence tomorrow morning and there is no cause for concern
8734447 we cannot tell you for how many days he will stay in the hospital at the moment
8734448 he is resting and has not had any visitor since he reached the hospital
8734449 if that is true if that is confirmed then thats really bad its very dangerous and a mistaken policy
8734450 it that was the case then the recent events could have a american domestic political dimension
8734451 if my suspicions are confirmed in that case the suspicion arises that somebody in the united states has intentionally created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8734452 if that was the case its nothing less than the use of so called administrative resources in a domestic political fight in its worst bloody dimension
8734453 moments after we passed by a christian village people set it on fire and everything was over within minutes
8734454 an incisive preventive and repressive action by indian authorities regarding such unacceptable acts of violence
8734455 are the words that are displayed on the whole crews golden bodies

8734458 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8734459 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8734460 ich empfehle beiden den ger teherstellern und anbietern mutig den weg nach vorn zu gehen

8734466 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8734467 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8734468 when you lose young people and the highly educated the country will not able to maintain its competitiveness
8734469 the importance of the lebanese abroad is not because of their numbers but because they worked hard and succeeded
8734470 theyre treated as junior with a capital j theyre given responsibilities their names appear on our publications if they work on them and they write articles and represent the center
8734471 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8734472 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8734473 i started walking today i brushed my own teeth today sat up in a chair today fed myself today
8734474 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8734475 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8734476 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8734477 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8734478 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8734479 i lost my love when i lost my loot in las vegas
8734480 we are washed up boy its later than you think
8734481 unicef and the government of lebanons central administration for statistics are working in partnership to conduct a nation wide survey to determine access to and effectiveness of social services and other development indicators that have an impact on the wellbeing of children
8734482 my people live on fishing and hunting caribou musk ox and snow geese that land in hundreds of thousands
8734483 but we have not filled our quota in the past years fewer bears are showing up
8734484 i will not trade my life in the village for anything in the world this is where i grew up hunting and fishing this is home
8734485 ms haddad there are whales out there come up to the bridge
8734486 its an instrument to detect and hear the songs of whales
8734487 by studying small scale turbulence we can study gas transfer
8734488 the more you know about interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean the more accurate the models are
8734489 over two million square kilometers of polar ice pack has disappeared over the five year period 2003 2007
8734490 yes the arctic is warming now but it will be cooling again within three years
8734491 there are eras of warming and eras of cooling natural forces are too strong to respond to the human factor carbon emissions could be a slight factor in the process of global warming but unless a thousand nuclear bombs are detonated i cant imagine any human force able to encounter the mighty powers of nature
8734492 unless washington leads the way toward a multilateral diplomatic solution the arctic could descend into armed conflict
8734493 its a lot easier getting into war than getting out of war
8734494 i cant believe were finally able to leave for medical treatment
8734495 we will smash the blockade so my son can get a prosthesis
8734496 the only people in the mediterranean without access to their own waters
8734497 your coming to gaza rewards the endurance of the palestinian population in the face of the occupation
8734498 by coming to gaza we realized the extent of the suffering of its population
8734499 were recruited in nepal to work as kitchen staff in hotels and restaurants in amman jordan
8734500 for 15 months mr gurung was held in iraq against his will before kbr and daoud allowed him to return home to nepal
8734501 allege that the illicit trafficking scheme from their recruitment in nepal to their eventual employment in iraq was engineering by kbr and its subcontractor
8734502 so it is premature for us to comment at this time
8734503 in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior
8734504 er selbst ist das werk und das werk ist er
8734505 die leute nannten es disco aber wir dachten wir machen rhythm and blues
8734506 egypt will supply 150 mw of electricity to lebanon at least and this amount could go as high as 450 mw if jordan and syria decided that they do not need this power at a particular time
8734507 i think electricity rationing will ease in the coming months because people will stop using air conditioning which consumes lot of power
8734508 we must first know if all the installations have been completed before asking how much lebanon will benefit from the additional power
8734509 but first we must invest in the construction of terminals and other facilities that will receive the lng from tankers and then ship them to the power plants
8734510 with a 110 barrel of oil lebanon can now generate an income of 5 billion a year if it extracted oil and over the next 20 years this will also attract international firms to explore for oil and gas
8734511 now that we have a national unity government the first thing we should do is revive the constitutional institutions in order to pass laws and regulations that will pave the way for oil and gas explorations
8734512 after the july 2006 war the campaign was put on hold because of the uncertain political situation
8734513 we are now relaunching in light of the new government and president and the ministerial and presidential statements
8734514 no one deserves the lebanese nationality more than lebanese women and their families
8734515 the new government has said it wants to give people of lebanese descent maybe 12 million people lebanese nationality while it prevents
8734516 nationality is not an end in itself but rather an access point for women and their families to exercise their full rights and citizenship in general
8734517 these amendments were due to collective campaigning efforts in the region
8734518 two weeks ago we met with president michel sleiman and michel aoun
8734519 those we have met with so far have all been very supportive of the campaign
8734520 as one of the three main deficits in the arab region
8734521 the millennium development goals in the arab region 2007 a youth lens
8734522 the considerable strides that women have taken towards gender parity in education have not been mirrored by noteworthy increases in rates of economic and political participation
8734523 one theory is that the helicopter approached a zone considered by hizbullah to be prohibited
8734524 another is that the shiite movement wanted to send a message to the army ahead of the nomination of an army chief and discussions on a national defense strategy
8734525 which took place in an area that is known be a stronghold for hizbullah
8734526 is hizbullah setting red lines for the lebanese army is the army prohibited to enter some areas
8734527 we ask all these questions today and we wait for the outcome of the investigation
8734528 i hope this medal can be a message of peace in afghanistan
8734529 today is a very happy day for all afghans because one of our afghan champions won a bronze medal in the beijing olympics
8734530 we feel very happy that an afghan athlete managed to bring victory to his country
8734531 afghan national security forces and coalition forces killed over 100 insurgents during combat operations in helmand province august 25 28
8734532 the patrols returned fire and called in close air support against the insurgents
8734533 if you slide into civil war your blood would be shed and your country would be destroyed while others will be living in peace and harmony
8734534 hurry up and start national dialogue it is your only way out of this critical situation
8734535 there are a number of wanted egyptians that are living in iran
8734536 this problem might escalate into a military conflict in the region it might also lead some arab countries to demand to have their own nuclear programs
8734537 i do not believe that a military strike against iran is an option for the current us administration but it might be an option for the coming one
8734538 all the names are the same for me i have no preferences
8734539 the next army chief should be patriotic and independent he should stand at one distance from all political parties
8734540 it is seven years since my last visit to lebanon i am glad to meet speaker berri after all this time
8734541 the speaker also informed me about the latest developments regarding the upcoming national dialogue and the electoral law i am happy to see things moving toward consensus in lebanon
8734542 had the activity been political or religious we would have drawn a larger crowd however we are determined to continue with our program
8734543 we are here to help the lebanese government and to cooperate with the army for the implementation of resolution 1701 which stipulates that there be no weapons in the area over which the unifil is responsible except for those of the lebanese army
8734544 the overall situation renders lebanons borders as penetrable as was the case one year ago
8734545 the system for passenger control checking of cargo and selection of vehicles and trucks for more thorough examination was on the whole inadequate
8734546 multi agency mobile force focusing on arms smuggling with the purpose of ensuring efficient arms seizures through its intelligence and rapid interception capabilities
8734547 should be established in particular at the operational level making border security management a joint effort
8734548 the presence and massive redeployment of armed hizbullah elements and their acquisition of capabilities both north and south of the litani river along with the continuous transfer of weapons from iran and syria to hizbullah are a blatant violation of resolution 1701 and other relevant security council resolutions
8734549 when we ask them to take full responsibilities we mean it
8734550 the palestinians have the right of return and this is an issue we are discussing with the israelis
8734551 we are with the decision of the lebanese government in terms of palestinian weapons in lebanon we are under the law and not above it
8734552 i told the president if we want to reach a solution with israel it should be a comprehensive one
8734553 it may not be easy but we want to reach a political solution to our cause its important to us to end the occupation of the golan and the shebaa farms
8734554 all the decisions taken by the lebanese government concerning palestinians
8734555 who is the only team to blow a 3 0 lead in a playoff series
8734556 the player who won the mvp award in the last all star game ever played at yankee stadium
8734557 is biased in favor of morocco after a declaration that the independence of western sahara is an unrealistic option
8734558 i am writing this tribune as former personal envoy of the secretary general of the united nations for western sahara
8734559 i was originally appointed to this post by secretary general kofi annan in august 2005 and the fifth semi annual extension of my appointment expired on august 21th last
8734560 but the security council is not ready to exercise its authority and impose it
8734561 the presence of nato forces in afghanistan has not only not helped ensure security but has led to the deaths of innocent people on a regular basis
8734562 some western powers by encouraging certain political forces and countries and calling on them to join military agreements are harming integration in the region and are creating tension in relations between neighboring countries
8734563 this is how they pave the way for political and military influence and unfortunately their unilateral actions are continuing
8734564 the fact is us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8734565 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of us president
8734566 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8734567 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8734568 just because theyre upset the little pet of certain western capitals didnt fulfill their expectations
8734569 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea as russian authorities are claiming in the media
8734570 the sco member states express their deep concern over the recent tensions surrounding the south ossetia question and call for the sides to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
8734571 basically the ship received conflicting information on when it was supposed to arrive in the suez canal
8734572 the global patriots arrival ahead of schedule was a significant contributing factor
8734573 we would like to express our sincere apology and profound sorrow for this tragic accident and extend our deepest sympathy to the family of mr mohammad afifi
8734574 we have offered financial assistance to the family realizing of course that no amount of money could ever compensate his family for the loss of life
8734575 we are reviewing our operating procedures as we cooperate closely with the government of egypt to ensure that such an incident is not repeated
8734576 i can assure you were going to ensure that all ships arrive at the prescribed time
8734577 the mehdi army suspension will be valid indefinitely and anyone who does not follow this order will not be considered a member of this group
8734578 we welcome this announcement that appears to be an effort to support the iraqi people
8734579 the proof is always in the actions and not just in words
8734580 we have set a cultural program for the mehdi army and we have named it al mumahidun supporters of the mehdi and everybody should abide by it and whoever does not agree with it will be expelled from the army
8734581 we want to transform as large a number as we can of mehdi army fighters into a social organization
8734582 the resistance is for the professional fighters only that will be selected according to sadrs rules
8734583 september 1 is the official date for the transfer of the security file of anbar from us forces to the iraqi military command
8734584 weve been ready for several months and our forces are completely ready to take over responsibility
8734585 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8734586 politicians are dragging their feet the prime minister ehud olmert who pledged to get gilad released might not be determined enough otherwise he would have resolved the issue
8734587 the large crowd we expect is indicative of the campaign that senator obama has run from the beginning change happens from the bottom up
8734588 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8734589 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the us
8734590 those judges who have taken a new oath of their offices have accepted the illegal actions of former president pervez musharraf
8734591 we are not fighting for our jobs but for principles
8734592 asif zardari is the enemy of judiciary enemy of justice
8734593 he is the chief justice and until he and other judges are reinstated our struggle will continue
8734594 the nation recognizes only iftikhar chaudhry as the chief justice and any other occupying his seat is illegal and unconstitutional
8734595 the explosives were packed in a white car parked on the roadside and detonated through a remote control it has left a crater in the ground
8734596 when it reached kurram bridge another vehicle standing near exploded
8734597 when the us invaded iraq it didnt do so to improve irans power position in the region but that was the result
8734598 that wasnt the purpose of the russian invasion of georgia either but it too may be the result
8734599 the reason is on grounds of principle if iran is going to start supporting the secession of territories that are unhappy with the central government then iran itself has some similar issues with ethnic dissatisfaction
8734600 dont view russia as a reliable partner they understand that russia may support iran on the nuclear file depending on its own security or policy interests but russia has also been quite clever in using iran as a bargaining chip in terms of its relationship with the us
8734601 the iranians are being very clever here theyre not likely to rush to russias defense unless russia comes to them and asks for their help and then they can ask for something in return
8734602 oil and gas companies now must factor in a new level of uncertainty
8734603 georgia is now unstable and that increases the risk of transporting hydrocarbons across it
8734604 if the btc and georgia wont be a reliable source of energy then iran will absolutely step up to the plate
8734605 you want gas well sell you gas will likely be their position
8734606 i think the swiss are a very good bellwether for the rest of europe on this
8734607 see the present crisis as an opportunity to go back to european colleagues and say lets take another look at this
8734608 it gives them some more leverage by going to the west and saying youre shooting yourselves in the foot here
8734609 the question is whether bush and cheney will feel empowered to behave in a more belligerent fashion or not
8734610 in the process of economic globalization muslims are not separatists
8734611 economic integration with the world they say is a positive thing but they dont want it to undermine their cultural identity
8734612 especially the increasing connections of our economy with others around the world
8734613 negative feelings toward the us and to a lesser extent european countries are widely seen as hostility toward the process of globalization of the inroads of the west into muslim societies
8734614 but while there is evidence that muslims do not want their culture to be changed to become like western culture we have found that they do want to be involved
8734615 the business has performed very well in the first half of 2008 despite a deteriorating global financial and economic background and these uncertainties remain
8734616 in the last few months the industry has reported early indications of weakening growth in some markets
8734617 the omani ship was released yesterday after lengthy efforts by the local authorities in puntland and elders
8734618 i cannot confirm if ransom was paid but united arab emirates officials were involved in the efforts to release it
8734619 ali is in good health and preparations are under way to reunite him with his family
8734620 his kidnappers gave a call to the un headquarters in the afternoon to say they had released keynan

8734622 having this financial support will allow me to hire graduate students as research assistants to comb through sources such as newspapers magazines and parliamentary debates from the period and examine how arguments in favour of and in opposition to bilingualism were couched
8734623 it will also allow me to travel to archives across the country where various organizations and governments have their papers stored and to interview key individuals who were active in both pro and anti bilingualism organizations
8734624 this funding will allow us to have one of the longest and most indepth research projects with data collected from both people with dementia and partners in care
8734625 with this support we are able to move forward with our theory development and test our ideas in other environments including long term care homes

8734631 the cooperation between the relevant oil firms from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8734632 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8734633 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realized this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8734634 you know the people who had their facts right all along

8734643 so tomorrow if theres a need for 20 more employees theyre calling them
8734644 with our volumes being down theres obviously going to be some idle employees in our manufacturing plants necessitating layoffs
8734645 by being creative with our workforce and how were operating aggressively managing our costs and overhead
8734646 its much better to say that we were there if needed than to not be there at all
8734647 we could not accurately forecast river flows and water levels without the data and support we receive from the usgs

8734652 obama says iran is a tiny country that doesnt pose a serious threat
8734653 aides to obama who will give his acceptance speech for the democratic nomination in a denver stadium on thursday evening said the ad was a distortion of his comments in may downplaying the iranian threat to america in comparison to the soviet menace during the cold war
8734654 lobbied for companies doing business with iran or otherwise have a vested interest in iran
8734655 its purely a byproduct of gameplay and this notion of a highly destructible environment
8734656 sticking to our ethos of do no harm to the game we tagged the parts in the environment for ads and like everything else in the game they can be destroyed its mirroring what the studio wants out of gameplay and making the most of it if we did anything that wasnt destructible in mercenaries 2 itd be awkward its taking advantage of the full environment
8734657 likely to be the most widely watched games in olympic history
8734658 we had more broadcast coverage to more people in more places than ever
8734659 its an area in which weve put a lot of investment and time its going to make more and more sense as digital evolves to connect from signage into point of sale or into coupons
8734660 we look at dr as an indicator of demand levels for general market activity
8734661 there is an inverse relationship and there is some weakness clearly in the general tv marketplace
8734662 it is worth the political price involved with putting up with winston for just a little longer in order to get this important policy enacted
8734663 while they now have the excuse of a slower economy to hide behind and they used it as such in their release results were weak
8734664 despite the weakness the company is clinging to the belief that its second half will be stronger helped by massive expense cuts and by pulling inventory lower we have seen this picture before and it is not a happy ending
8734665 our second quarter results reflect the continued effects of a slowing economy which contributed to the earnings declines we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007
8734666 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8734667 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8734668 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8734669 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8734670 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8734671 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8734672 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8734673 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8734674 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 per cent
8734675 isnt it funny roger how the arrested development of those weve ahem left behind is so screamingly obvious
8734676 each cockroach produces 600 babies in their lifetime and we have more than 100 entrants so our success to date is that we are reducing 60 000 cockroaches without using any chemicals at all and thats the beauty of it

8734681 allen convinced investors to finance his projects without telling them about his actual uses of their funds or his dismal track record in failing to generate investor returns
8734682 this enforcement action reflects the commissions unwavering commitment to pursue and punish unscrupulous promoters who choose not to make full disclosure to their investors
8734683 this enforcement action should deter allen and others from offering investments without disclosing fundamental information to unsuspecting investors investors are encouraged to carefully review and ask questions about offering materials they receive to assure that they understand and appreciate such disclosures when made

8734715 americans who worked so hard to reach the point that an individual be truly judged based on the content of his character not the color of his skin
8734716 as a caucasian female living in new york i never thought id see this day either
8734717 i am thrilled beyond belief that so many see and support the content of obamas character it is proof that we are finally putting the issue of color where it belongs behind us
8734718 i feel like im here basically standing on the shoulders of my ancestors
8734719 i never thought in my lifetime id see a black man be nominated for president of the united states
8734720 finally after 400 years we are truly truly recognized as americans
8734721 i am not a delegate just an obama supporter im here to witness and be a part of history
8734722 there is optimism in the air there is hope and celebration in everyones eyes
8734723 not since john kennedys presidency have i felt the hope and excitement of a new direction for this country that i feel obama brings
8734724 if he proves to be just another politician ill be hugely disappointed at this point in time i dont think he is
8734725 with such an ingrained thought process by asian men maybe the women of
8734726 we are putting a lot of effort into finding the right settings on the car for this track on top of that we are obviously paying careful attention to reliability and the way the car behaves over the monza kerbs an aspect of the package that saw us in difficulty last year
8734727 i think we are working well even if we will only have the first real confirmation of this after qualifying for the italian grand prix
8734728 now the batch of cursed conrods is no longer being used and we have instigated very close controls on the parts we are using
8734729 the large crowd that we expect is indicative of the campaign that senator obama has run from the beginning change happens from the bottom up
8734730 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8734731 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8734732 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8734733 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment

8734752 to speak openly disagree respectfully and work collaboratively on an energy plan that bridges the gap between the status quo which is no longer acceptable and freedom from carbon which is not yet attainable in other words we need to chart a short term strategy while we advance our long term vision for an energy independent oregon
8734753 to put the cold facts on the table so the public knows whats at stake knows what options are available and knows that my bottom line is this when it comes to energy oregon families and businesses must always have supply certainty and price stability
8734754 as we think and invest long term we need a reality check about the short term
8734755 we only have one line into clatsop county at this time and there wont be a way to increase capacity if we cant put in more

8734778 manny pacquiao is considered the best fighter in boxing today and i always want to fight the best
8734779 i am glad we were able to make this fight happen because while pacquiao is at the pinnacle of his success and has defeated all of the top fighters he has faced i am going to show the world that it stops with me dec 6 cant get here soon enough
8734780 this is my greatest challenge when i take that walk to the ring to fight oscar i will carry all the people of the philippines the entire country on my shoulders i promise i will fight with all of my heart and that i will give everything i have like my trainer freddie roach says i have what it takes to win the biggest fight of my life
8734781 there was only one fight which truly got people talking some with excitement some with skepticism
8734782 its not just a fight its truly an event it transcends the sport in a way i have never seen before including oscars fight with mayweather this is a fight between superstars who have captured the imagination of their people and beyond the two most popular fighters in the world amp its a dream matchup its this kind of event that will have boxing on the front pages the world will be talking top ranks bob arum and i had our work cut out for ourselves on this one but we did it
8734783 when people started talking when people started saying manny can beat me and freddie started talking it started to become a challenge
8734784 these are the kind of events that get me fired up
8734785 when a certain person merchant in the boxing industry who is a boxing expert mentioned the possibility last year of me fighting pacquiao it stuck in my head
8734786 it kept on lingering in my head i kept thinking about it over the months to this day i say to myself can i really fight manny pacquiao and beat the pound for pound champion
8734787 i am older im bigger and hes younger and the pound for pound champion but when people started saying manny can beat you manny can knock you out and freddie roach started saying oscar cant pull the trigger any more it started to become a challenge to me and now it is very personal especially when manny pacquiao beats all the legendary mexican fighters to me its a challenge especially because people are talking that manny pacquiao can beat me well see dec 6
8734788 the size difference wont be a big deal to me or manny
8734789 i understand the relentless style manny has for me as a 35 year old fighter it really is a big challenge to me i felt challenged especially from an expert trainer who trained me and trains manny he knows my style and knows manny if he thinks i cant pull the trigger well see dec 6
8734790 i think a lot of people will be very surprised when we are standing next to each other size wont be that much of a difference it wont be like roy jones and john ruiz
8734791 i know everybody thinks that this fight is going to be a difficult fight for me and some people say its a very easy fight for oscar but you know what i always do my job in the ring and do my best to win the fight i can beat de la hoya i saw his last performance and im faster and stronger than him and i am younger i think the point is my speed is going to be effective in this fight de la hoya has an advantage in height but i believe i am stronger than him so its going to be a great fight
8734792 manny has asked me not to talk about numbers or percentages
8734793 richard and i will confer about whether well make a statement on that
8734794 the fact is each fighter wanted the fight and each looks at is a challenge each had to give a little bit and we were able to make the fight
8734795 it is important for boxing that at least once a year there is a matchup which truly transcends the sport which captures the imagination of sports fans everywhere and which has everyone buzzing
8734796 de la hoya pacquiao is that matchup for 2008 it is a true megafight which people will be talking about for years to come

8734804 n o podemos deixar que aconte a aqui o que aconteceu na unb o estatuto est sendo reformado e ontem no conselho tinham cinco estudantes representantes dos campi da universidade foi um processo democr tico
8734805 olympic medals have their jade parts showing on the back while paralympic medals have their jade parts showing on the front

8734807 art 1o findo o mandato do presidente da rep blica quem o
8734808 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8734809 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8734810 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8734811 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8734812 just because theyre upset that the little pet of certain western capitals didnt fulfil their expectations
8734813 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea as russian authorities are claiming in the media
8734814 the sco member states express their deep concern over the recent tensions surrounding the south ossetia question and call for the sides to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
8734815 what my book attempts to do is give voice to the millions of people in the middle
8734816 i tell them that science and religion can be mutually enriching mutually enhancing and can in many ways spur each other to greatness
8734817 we do a lot of speaking a lot of programs
8734818 we have a dodge sprinter van and we live with people in their homes for a few days or a week or more we take over their guest bedrooms as our office and sleep in the van its our bedroom on wheels and we speak three or four times a week
8734819 for many evolution has never been interpreted in a meaningful way
8734820 it hasnt been interpreted in a sacred way the same facts can be interpreted in multiple ways and we offer an inspiring interpretation that is meaningful and builds and strengthens faith people come to accept it and not just the way they accept death and taxes they wholeheartedly embrace it
8734821 i never felt that the separation between religion and science is necessary
8734822 its always been such an automatic part of the discussion that these groups cant get together but his approach of evolution as theology puts a whole different twist on it makes it appealing to many different people
8734823 he describes god in a way that even an atheist can understand
8734824 maybe they wont embrace it but they wont go screaming and running away
8734825 what inspires them gets them so excited and gives them hope for their own lives and the future is a new way of understanding reality and their relationship to reality
8734826 it gives them hope to overcome the challenges in their lives and in their families it helps to reconcile head and heart faith and reason humanists and evangelicals can find enough common ground to have a discussion and for many people it gives them hope for our species and our world
8734827 how the marriage of science and religion will transform your life and our world
8734828 god glorifying christ edifying scripture honoring way of thinking about evolution
8734829 we live in a world today that is very different from the world that our instincts evolved to deal with
8734830 we have cravings for sugar salts and fats because for 99 percent of human history we didnt have easy access to those things
8734831 today we have a far more empirical way of talking about human nature than through stories like the original sin
8734832 who is god is the universe god what is our purpose and meaning what is good and evil who determines our future the bible gives us very specific answers
8734833 i find it fascinating that we are descended from something like lucy
8734834 but im not sure i find it upsetting or comforting spiritually
8734835 can and should temper our judgments about our morality and immorality
8734836 i could never quite understand why i had behaved that way
8734837 i think the physical change in my body was so strong that it completely overpowered any moral teachings and religious beliefs i had
8734838 thank god for evolution how the marriage of science and religion will transform your life and our world

8734844 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it
8734845 if theyre going to say im lying im out of control im going to show that theyre lying and theyre out of control
8734846 i went to new orleans a few days ago just for the night

8734861 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8734862 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics

8734869 as this is now a criminal investigation the council is unable to make any further comments at this stage we have also notified the information commissioner of this incident
8734870 i regret the concern caused to charnwood residents by this serious matter we have worked vigorously to investigate the case
8734871 nothing matters more than the way we think about evolution
8734872 trying to understand reality without an evolutionary worldview is like trying to understand infection without microscopes or the structure of the universe without telescopes
8734873 thank god for evolution how the marriage of science and religion will transform your life and our world

8734893 debating whether god or evolution created the universe is like asking who said this sentence me or my vocal chords

8734895 for the last six years he has traveled across north america with his wife connie barlow in a van that displays an image of two fish kissing each other one labeled jesus the other darwin explaining to conservative and liberal congregations why understanding and accepting evolution will bring them closer to spiritual fulfillment the religious advantage to embracing the evolutionary worldview dowd says is that it explains our frailties our addictions our infidelities and other moral deficiencies as byproducts of adaptation over billions of years and that he says has a potentially liberating effect never mind guilt once we understand our sinful ways we can get past them and play a conscious role in the evolution of humanity

8734900 we should not forget that the lessons of 1968 apply still in 2008 that we must be strong and vigilant in defence of our values and not look the other way when a small independent country is invaded by its neighbour

8734916 i havent read it yet i dont want to speak precipitously
8734917 the u s attorneys manual is a big deal in the prosecutorial community
8734918 tends to be terse in how it treats these issues
8734919 were best positioned to get it right to refine it if necessary
8734920 such enlightenment was only achieved after years of criticism levied by the white collar bar the american bar association a number of former attorneys general the u s chamber of commerce and various business organizations
8734921 that policy cannot standing alone reverse the widespread culture of waiver created by all these federal policies a culture that is seriously undermining both the confidential attorney client relationship and basic employee rights in the corporate community

8734924 is basically to help people see that evolution and when i say evolution what im meaning is the history of the universe the history of cosmos earth life humanity so basically the entire history of the universe that our best science is giving us what 97 98 percent of the scientists of the world agree with how that can be understood in a god glorifying way that is a sacred way a meaningful way an inspiring way in a way that will motivate people to be of service in the world to add their creative energies toward creating a healthy world and to live lives of greater compassion love integrity commitment
8734925 to show people how a holy view of evolution can inspire people to give their lives in service to a healthy world and to do so with religious devotion
8734926 thank god for evolution how the marriage of science and religion will transform your life and our world
8734927 ive always thought there had to be a way for the two to not be fighting each other to be compatible
8734928 many religious people reject evolution because theyve been taught or told that its contradictory to their faith
8734929 for billions of years life has found ways of creating greater complexity and interdependence
8734930 those are mythic terms traditional poetic understandings that point to something thats true
8734931 i hold all these concepts all these doctrines to be true in a symbolic sense its not about whether someone chooses to believe in the literal miracles of the bible
8734932 whether one interprets the stories of jesus as complete fiction or myth it doesnt matter the person the character of jesus the christ is the authenticity trust and humility
8734933 id love to debate him but id be sorry to embarrass him in front of a large group of people
8734934 he should study creation science there is good evidence that the earth is less than 10 000 years old
8734935 the creation evolution debate relates to how powerful is god is god honest he said six days the context seems to say six days why cant it be six days
8734936 they didnt come into the world they grew out of it
8734937 certainly anything that encourages more environmental responsibility is a good thing we do have the responsibility of assuring that the generation after us has an earth to live on and the generation after them
8734938 i think the time will come when this topic is big in the media and people cant avoid talking about it
8734939 discount our fundamental belief that god is the source of life
8734940 were always discovering things that previously we didnt have the equipment or knowledge to understand as a people of faith we always have the responsibility of learning and expanding our experiences
8734941 wide or basically the width of a stud or joist end you simply peel off the backing and adhere to the isolation tape to the face of all of the studs or the joist prior to screwing in the sheetrock this will isolate the stud or joist structure from the finished drywall this isolation helps to reduce airborne sound transmission as well as structure borne transmission through the studs or joists there is another method that employs the american sound isolation tape and that is to double layer it on every other stud if your studs are 16 oc then you will be taping every other stud at 32

8734984 terwijl ik oprecht zijn vertrek uit onze organisatie betreur wens ik craig in de eerste plaats te bedanken voor zijn voorname verwezenlijkingen voor delhaize groep gedurende de laatste zeven jaar en hem het allerbeste toe te wensen in zijn nieuwe functie
8734985 craig is een toonbeeld in leiderschap geweest om binnen het bedrijf sterke financi le strategische en it organisaties uit te bouwen deze organisaties zullen in de toekomst blijvend onze prestaties en groei ondersteunen bijzonder competente professionelen leiden de departementen onder craigs verantwoordelijkheid we hebben een procedure opgestart die naarstig zal worden uitgevoerd om een nieuwe cfo aan te duiden
8734986 hoezeer ik uitkijk naar deze nieuwe professionele uitdaging was het een moeilijke beslissing om delhaize groep te verlaten waar ik de kans heb gehad om samen te werken met een bekwaam management team in een bedrijf met een welverdiende reputatie als leider in de sector
8734987 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control
8734988 i go and help people in rehab thats control how can she say im out of control if theyre going to say im lying im out of control im going to show that theyre lying and theyre out of control
8734989 samantha is one of the biggest problems in her life
8734990 thats what dina told me im reacting on what dina said but then dina steps out of the picture because she wants to look like the good guy
8734991 she wants to try to look good and stay on lindsays good side instead of being a good parent
8734992 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8734993 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8734994 star went on to say that she believes her father is addicted to fame and if he really cared about her he would respect her wishes
8734995 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8734996 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8734997 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8734998 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8734999 voglio scrivere roba che il mondo intero legga roba che faccia reagire la gente a livello emotivo roba che li faccia urlare piangere tremare di rabbia e di dolore
8735000 now that britney has her bod back should we send her vt messages to get her to quit smoking
8735001 should homeland security include vt as part of their interagency communications package
8735002 you can do a lot more things if your linemen know what theyre doing
8735003 you can run and you can throw even with inexperienced players if you have a good line
8735004 anthony is a very sound player he can control our football team
8735005 hes a very smart kid hes very talented in school academically hes got a good arm and great leadership skills
8735006 hes not intimidated taking over at quarterback because of those three big guys out there protecting him
8735007 were still more of a spread team that throws the ball and runs the ball out of a spread set
8735008 throughout the years ive learned that if you know how to throw the ball and if youve got a kid who can get it down field you can have some success were not going to change that
8735009 once those skill kids get caught up to the line we could be in good shape
8735010 we return a lot of experience from a pretty good defense last year
8735011 theyre a year older so theyre going to be pretty good
8735012 we kind of sit back protect the run and force you to throw the ball
8735013 i think we have a great conference because we have some rivalries in south park south fayette and steel valley and weve had some great games with some of the new teams bishop canevin and keystone oaks
8735014 i think for our friday night football games were going to have great crowds theres not a lot of far travel with that closeness in the communities the kids know each other it will make for some great games
8735015 we need to stay healthy because were very young depth wise
8735016 but you cant jump ahead you have to go through the conference first the thing that baffles me is how they can pick you as the favorite for the wpial championship game if you have injuries your whole season is in jeopardy if you dont have kids who can step in
8735017 one of our strengths is probably our experience the line should be a strength for us we should be very solid on the line
8735018 i try to tell all these seniors that its their turn
8735019 i would definitely say one of my concerns is the linebacking corps we have two starters back but we have others who are banged up
8735020 brians looked ok in practice its been a tough transition for him i think he will be fine
8735021 its a new year for tyler he has a new opportunity
8735022 hes got to be our leader exactly like his two brothers this is his turn its always been dom and zach and the little brother hes waited for this chance for a couple of years probably since he was little
8735023 i think it was sort of easy for him in the past with lucas nix on the line lucas got all the attention he eger kind of got a free pass
8735024 now hes going to be the guy theyre looking at
8735025 i kind of watched them to see what they would do
8735026 both my brothers won wpial championships in their senior year i dont want to be the decicco that doesnt do it
8735027 for a lot of our kids its their first opportunity brian baldrige missed a whole year
8735028 one of the big things for the older guys like brock is their leadership they saw what the older guys did last year
8735029 i think we know how to do that face adversity i use zach decicco as an example all the time if we move you to another position its for the betterment of the team
8735030 the public has a compelling interest in ensuring the separation of powers among the branches is respected
8735031 never before have the federal courts directed a present or former executive branch official let alone a close advisor to the president to appear and testify under oath before congress or to produce documents or descriptions of privileged documents for congresss inspection
8735032 for me more than anything this was a chance to better understand a very complex challenge in a critical part of the world and to try to do that through the eyes of the leadership who live and work and fight there every single day
8735033 i cannot tel but but i can say that theyve been working very hard since the release of shadow of the colossus
8735034 i wanted the story to have some dramatic power something to hold you i wanted the little side missions which are a staple of casual games to be a little more organic in some casual games they can get a little sloppy at least in wmc the little things such as the parts where you have to mix the chemicals in the lab have some relevance to the main story
8735035 we knew there was something we could make a game out of but we didnt just want to abandon what everyone had been playing around with
8735036 the great thing about line rider is its elegant simplicity
8735037 we knew there was so much we could do to it but we didnt want to ruin it by making it too complex
8735038 he came out for about a month and a half
8735039 we put him up across the street and have him come over every day he and our lead engineer here started playing around with the next update of the flash version
8735040 after they did that we sat down and bounced around ideas like game design stuff and what we wanted to feature in the new games
8735041 you just push a button and it spits out an avi
8735042 i started watching these videos come out on youtube and called up techdawg
8735043 we had him come here to help us with course design he amazingly has really good design sense he flew out for about three weeks and sat down and went over game design ideas and tried to figure out what we wanted out of story mode maps
8735044 the differences with the wii are basically in the user interface
8735045 when you go into a console version they want more screen real estate we have collapsible menus but other than that they are very very similar
8735046 republicans are concerned about liebermans pro choice stance and his weak record on judges
8735047 were not betting any money on lieberman being selected and making pledges but the possibility of a senate reorganization is too enticing to ignore
8735048 of all the office buildings downtown washington square is perhaps the oddest place for an underwear art hung on a clothesline controversy one of its tenants is victorias secret the lingerie store under renovation until fall is just a few feet from where the installation once stood victorias secret is known for its racy window displays of scantily clad mannequins
8735049 a strange brand of american prudery has made it impossible for some people to conserve energy and money by using a clothesline
8735050 my husband does not like to see someone elses clothes hanging in their yards we live in a controlled community where beauty landscape is a big aspect of keeping the property value my husband argues that in order to allow people to hang out their clothes we all have to have our yards fenced so no one get to see anything i grew up hanging my clothes out not in this country so for me not being able to do it it is a bit difficult to understand i believe that even hanging out just what is not private would help a lot with the fact of saving energy i mean we can hang out pants t shirts sheets towels etc that will certainly reduce energy consumption and would make our clothes last for longer i think that there is nothing more beautiful than our planet and if we have to sacrifice some comfort in order to preserve it for future generations we have to do it and do it now thank you for this great initiative good luck
8735051 i think were better off in this conference we fit better with our enrollment
8735052 we were in that conference once before it will be good competition i think that were better fitted for this conference with where our numbers are
8735053 i think we have a chance to have a real good team this year we have an inexperienced quarterback but we have experience in the backfield
8735054 brendan is in his first year back there as a starter at quarterback and he has looked good all through summer camp and during the things we did before we put pads on he separated himself
8735055 d j is our big gun were going to feature him hes a 220 pound running back with a lot of speed he was on a relay track team in the spring
8735056 and we can switch around because lamont robinson is a good running back too
8735057 hopefully the plan is to get away with throwing 10 to 12 passes a game play a more controlled game and run the ball better we couldnt run the ball last year
8735058 we know we have some good players returning some good skill players we have a lot of experience at running back if we can get better on the line and the line stays healthy well be ok
8735059 i kind of look at this year as the same as last year
8735060 so hopefully our line stays healthy and were able to develop a few backups
8735061 we have a good nucleus we really try to play 15 or 16 kids ive been happy with their performance in the preseason
8735062 we have a soccer player bodell kicking for us this year
8735063 d j clark does our punting he is a good punter
8735064 special teams is a giant part of the game its a chance for me to get more guys into the game its a tough combination you cant take all your best players off the field at one time
8735065 we should put more emphasis on special teams we didnt have one field goal last year and missed a bunch of extra points
8735066 codys been a surprise hes a snapper and cover kid he flies to the ball
8735067 hes small but very aggressive i like a guy like that on special teams hes not playing full time but hes good at what he does
8735068 the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
8735069 he knows our system as a receiver and hes also an experienced returner in this league and did a nice job for us in training camp and a pre season game
8735070 ive just been trying to stay in shape back home
8735071 i mostly did a lot of running because the cardio work is hard to get back
8735072 whether its the first week the second week or mid season its an opportunity
8735073 we decided to create our own unique social networking site for trapt fans because of our frustration with myspace
8735074 simply a way for us to eliminate the middle man or third wheel so to speak
8735075 why did you quit filming to clean the windshield you dope
8735076 i cant believe it man we were getting it on tape but you you had to stop and clean the windshield that was so stupid
8735077 i am an only child i am an only child and the money is all mine
8735078 the business plan was absolutely unbelievable and the connection from grassroots hockey in this province hockey alberta the western hockey league to the two nhl teams was as good as weve ever seen
8735079 it will be the first time that every player in this event will get to play in an nhl arena and that is special for european players as well as canadian players
8735080 well definitely have a schedule where the canadian team will have to stay in one arena for the regular games and the finals will be in the other
8735081 weve worked that through pretty well with the committee already and we feel very confident that both sites are going to be well looked after from the canadian side
8735082 weve looked at pricing and weve looked at demographics and we said you know what edmonton can make this work with canada in their pool
8735083 and the medal games can go to calgary because of scheduling and a bunch of other variables and there was never a bone of contention between us
8735084 it is absolutely ok that hockey goes where hockey is strong junior hockey in the iihf would not be the same without canada
8735085 it was absolutely the right thing to do our teams appreciate travelling dont underestimate the positives for all the other teams playing the swedes the finns the russians playing in canada in a country where hockey is what it is these experiences they take home will help hockey in other countries
8735086 theres no question we expect this to break all the attendance records because it will be the first time weve been able to play all the games in nhl buildings
8735087 in ottawa its going to break a record but its going to continue to grow but when you look ahead to 2012 this should set records too
8735088 lol theres to much sh t going on in your sig
8735089 if im such a bigshot because of my seniority here why am i a furry
8735090 an artistic preference doesnt make me an idiot an immediate assumption makes a fool of us all
8735091 wikipedia is the bible for dumbasses anyone can alter it millions will read and believe anythings fact and this is why i dont take you seriously
8735092 lol theres to much sh t going on in your sig
8735093 i dont want to read this book ugh do i have to
8735094 i dont think canadians were looking for an election but i think theyre ready to have one if thats what has to happen
8735095 i dont think theres going to be too much of a push back from canadians if in fact the writ is dropped
8735096 the data that were seeing suggests that if stephane dion and the liberals perform well in the campaign and soft ndp soft bloc quebecois and soft green voters are looking to change government that could favour the liberals
8735097 but thats an important if if stephane dion and the liberals perform well in the campaign its obviously a rule that holds true for the conservatives too
8735098 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the u s specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8735099 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8735100 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8735101 they were acting in implementing orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8735102 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8735103 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before aug 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area
8735104 there is the u s labor day holiday on monday and the market will be shut theres a lot of nervousness
8735105 it was a honeymoon wedding with our family and friends so its sort of a double whammy
8735106 were in the process now of contacting the credit card company and finding out what type of insurance we have through visa
8735107 what im thinking right now is that were not going to be able to recoup our money and our wedding in scotland is going to be cancelled
8735108 the reason for going to scotland is that my fianc es grandparents are living there
8735109 we were going to see them because theyre unable to fly over here due to insurance theyre an elderly couple
8735110 i dont know how to apply my energy at any given moment but excess energy now thats another story i exercise for that
8735111 with a fine ruby colour yalumba y series sanviovese ros 2006 has exotic aromas of raspberries strawberries and cream with notes of lilac and violets all with a minerally edge
8735112 bikes can be expensive you need lights you need helmets you need shoes you need panniers and bags to carry the clothes that youre going to change into
8735113 cycling doesnt have to be expensive but were also kidding ourselves if we think its as easy as pulling a dusty old bike out of the garage
8735114 one parking spot is probably worth tens of thousands of dollars and they just give it away if they want people to stop using that spot you make it more enticing
8735115 people arent going to change over just because you tell them about it
8735116 for me doing something to reward people who burn calories instead of fossil fuel is a way to start leveling the playing field and give people choices for whats right for them
8735117 this is one of the things were doing to try to make it easier for all of our employees to exercise regularly but also it is good for the downtown environment its good for less pollution in the air its just fun too
8735118 we brought in additional officers from our national screening force theyre available to travel to different airports based on need
8735119 the transportation security officers providing security at the democratic convention are honored to do so
8735120 however if collective bargaining rights were in place for these employees the process for selecting employees for special assignments and dealing with overtime and leave issues during peak travel times would run much more smoothly and equitably than it does at the current time
8735121 i promise to love you cherish you and trust you
8735122 if it wasnt for harley you two wouldnt have met
8735123 we really wanted to get married during the 105th because its a once in a lifetime experience and you can only do this once
8735124 if you look at that time period that was a drastic
8735125 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8735126 the next president will inherit a military that is stretched and stressed its equipment especially its aerospace equipment is old in years and usage
8735127 the armys overall budget is focused on fighting todays wars with todays platforms
8735128 from 1992 to 2007 the estimated acquisition costs remaining for major weapons programs increased almost 120 percent while the annual funding provided for these programs increased only 57 percent current programs are experiencing on average a 21 month delay in delivering initial capabilities to the warfighter often forcing dod to spend additional funds on maintaining legacy systems
8735129 we have serious economic problems and there are huge bills to pay there are going to be some who want to make defense a bill payer
8735130 either we commit to a decade long defense recapitalization and modernization
8735131 i am really excited i think it will be a wonderful experience
8735132 what were looking for is not mr popularity what were looking for is a solid leader who can deal with the issues facing our nation and john mccain has shown he can do that
8735133 i had a little time off last fall and decided i was going to do what i could to see wisconsin go red im not sure i could do it from a national impact but i was certainly going to do whatever i could to make sure wisconsin goes red and not just at camp randall on saturdays in the fall
8735134 doing the speech at mile high is an important point for our campaign
8735135 its symbolic of how sen obama won the nomination it will show how obama wants to involve people who are not usually involved in the political process
8735136 aiming for a lot of high rhetoric i am much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8735137 i want to thank somebody who knew i was running for president before i knew i was running for president the first time i met minneapolis mayor r t rybak he said to me you should run for president and i said what are you talking about and here we are
8735138 the first time i met minneapolis mayor r t rybak he said to me you should run for president and i said what are you talking about and here we are
8735139 i pretty much sat down and said hi i think you should run for president
8735140 and he pretty much laughed and said hi my name is barack obama and im probably not going to
8735141 i looked across the table and just said something that i was almost surprised came out of my mouth
8735142 i said its not often that a single person with a single act can change the world but you can
8735143 now as i go to denver and think about that night and see him stand up and give that speech and put together what it felt like in iowa when he won or in minnesota when he won or all of these other times its just almost beyond comprehension how excited i am
8735144 i am not looking for another job i love the job i have im more interested in figuring out where im best called to be
8735145 im talking to lots of people but mostly im doing my job
8735146 people look at minneapolis and they think taxes they think crime
8735147 in my part of the state when they open the paper and they see 500 000 being spent on artistic fountains while at the same time rybak is talking about we dont have more money for police and lga is being cut and woe is me its all about priorities
8735148 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week
8735149 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and every thing i own is under water
8735150 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
8735151 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicated on when its supposed to arrive
8735152 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
8735153 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be
8735154 that first game that right there ill never forget that
8735155 even though we didnt make it to the super bowl that year that was my super bowl i never seen anything like that and i was just happy to see people out in the streets just happy to see the saints play that day thats probably one thing ill always remember about new orleans is that day
8735156 there are some areas where it looks like it happened yesterday
8735157 those are houses people used to live in and theyre not living there any more so where are they
8735158 i felt like we were all kind of in this thing together
8735159 im trying to rebuild my career coming off the injury and changing teams kind of a fresh start for me a fresh start for the organization and a fresh start for the city
8735160 the more you talk to people and the more you drive around i think you just feel like life is back
8735161 when the storm happened your mind set had to be were going to make things better than they were before were going to try to turn this into a positive somehow some way i see that happening in a lot of areas so just to kind of be there and just feel like youre kind of a part of the rebuilding process is rewarding
8735162 ich bin nat rlich entt uscht aber ich war knapp dran einen topmann zu schlagen das war ein match auf dem ich aufbauen kann
8735163 es w re sch n gewesen ich war wahrscheinlich ein bisschen nerv s
8735164 ich habe gut gespielt ich war wahrscheinlich ein bisschen verkrampft es ist doch mein erstes mal hier
8735165 es fehlt nicht viel es fehlt halt die erfahrung wo ich gegen eine top spielerin den ball in entscheidenden situationen hinspielen muss um den punkt zu machen
8735166 irgendwann kassiere ich die siege dann hei t es 6 4 statt 4 6
8735167 continuous controls monitoring is moving beyond expense reports i like to say its where csi meets t amp e
8735168 identify the exceptions anomalies and trends over time the beauty is you dont need to hire 100 000 people to look at 1 million transactions a year youve got a computer chugging away
8735169 if im an employee at a certain level but spending at the executive level thats a concern there are a lot of kinds of tests you can put together
8735170 companies dont like cash when people are using cash were concerned about it thats an area that is fraught with and ripe for fraud
8735171 fraudsters do things over time the more you can look at trends and anomalies the more you can identify people who are committing fraud
8735172 the system is smart enough to look at all those transactions in a city and basically give the average
8735173 until you automate your expense reimbursement process you cant do
8735174 its the advent of automated expense management that has really turned the dial in terms of being able to leverage this data and to do analytics that we could never do before
8735175 ich bin kein psychologe ich wei aber was nach dem 1 2 in den k pfen los war
8735176 das war kein gutes spiel total zerfahren wir haben keine mittel gegen einen kompakten gegner gefunden
8735177 as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man
8735178 to work on a variety of political campaigns in arizona
8735179 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8735180 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
8735181 well start on the day we said well start and well finish on the day we said we would finish
8735182 para ganar la champions hay que vencer a los mejores
8735183 para ganar la liga de campeones hay que ganar a los mejores tener un grupo complicado es mejor para empezar fuerte y arrancar mejor la competici n
8735184 sobre el papel otros equipos espa oles lo tienen m s f cil
8735185 no hay que asustarse sino competir porque somos el equipo que m s veces ha ganado esta competici n tenemos mucha ilusi n por volver a ganarla pero con tranquilidad paso a paso
8735186 en este tipo de sorteos no se pueden hacer pron sticos
8735187 de un conjunto as se pueden hacer pocos an lisis siempre tienen peligro llegan con muchas ganas por no haber competido el pasado a o
8735188 es un conjunto peligroso compensado y con jugadores de mucha calidad
8735189 es un conjunto modesto pero si perdemos puntos al principio puede que sean dif ciles de recuperar
8735190 there is no question that russia had planned its measures long before
8735191 when we checked in to our hotel there were 48 other journalists
8735192 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment
8735193 but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8735194 cest un feu tr s virulent et qui avance vite aid par un vent de 20 25 km h qui change r guli rement dorientation
8735195 its going to create a significant amount of new traffic and people like me and my family moved out here to get away from the city
8735196 if nobody wants to talk with us on these issues and cooperation with russia is not needed then for gods sake do it yourself
8735197 not because anyone is asking us and not because we want to look good in someones eyes
8735198 we are doing it because it corresponds to our national interests because in this field our interests coincide with those of many european countries and those of the united states
8735199 the russian president raised the possibility of continuing the dialogue and the discussion
8735200 i support john mccain because he likes the bush tax cuts which really helped out economy
8735201 its the realization of a dream coming to fruition that rev dr king spoke so magnificently about
8735202 its wonderful im just proud of him im proud of his wife
8735203 i think it represents great advances that we are making in the integration of all people into the government and all levels of life in the country
8735204 and obama is in a position that is almost unbelievable

8735260 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8735261 god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8735262 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8735263 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8735264 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8735265 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8735266 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8735267 truly grave moral reasons not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences
8735268 good environment good market and has no polyester manufacturing capability
8735269 weve found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8735270 our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes
8735271 this means the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechano sensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper pre flight pose
8735272 its best to aim a bit forward of its location and try and anticipate where the fly will jump when it first sees your swatter
8735273 he called and basically wanted to make sure that i was as involved as i could possibly be and told me that he wanted me to be more involved and wanted me to help on the policy level and to co chair the campaign at home so i told him ill do anything
8735274 and he also asked me if i would travel for him this fall and i told him ill go anywhere do anything that you ask
8735275 i dont know how that works and ya know what i didnt even ask him
8735276 this investment will start the development of the la plata port allowing it to take advantage of the natural conditions it offers
8735277 many of us are anticipating that starting next year the situation will improve
8735278 the market in toronto has been quite depressed lately and many investors have been fleeing to more stable securities
8735279 i think well have a pretty good year in 2008 it looks to me that well grow about 15
8735280 its hard to really look beyond 2008 but 2009 shouldnt be any different
8735281 sagicor really emerged from a caribbean base and is seeking to grow beyond the caribbean into the us and the uk in particular
8735282 the caribbean remains an integral part of their base that allows a kind of springboard to expand and acquire business in first world countries
8735283 within the caribbean jamaica is a significant part of sagicor in terms of revenues and assets under management jamaica until the end of last year was about 30 to 35 of sagicor as they expand that proportion will sink and sink but its not going to shrink because the jamaica operations are shrinking its because theyre expanding more rapidly elsewhere
8735284 what the merger will do for us is give us economies of scale to deliver a product that is even more cost effective than what we do now so there are ways in which the customer will win out of this transaction
8735285 im sure that sentiment is out there but its not a business where there are any big barriers to entry
8735286 for example guardian life entered the market about three years ago and took quite a market share they have about 25 now so a brand new player came into the market and found they could carve out a piece for themselves
8735287 the blue cross brand is not something we are buying so that brand becomes available about 18 months after the transaction is complete if somebody wants to enter the market and use that same brand they are free to do so
8735288 that is largely because loj is a very institutionalized name in jamaica
8735289 it has a pretty rich background but we felt that our effort to contribute to the groups international brand building should make jamaican clients feel theyre not just clients of a strong jamaican company but ultimately clients of an international company
8735290 its a strange thing id say people over the age of lets say 50 who have known loj over these many years are the ones with some reservations the brand that they knew is gone people of 20 30 40 years old they have not had that association with loj so its not so important to them
8735291 it was in recognition of the rebranding and name change to sagicor i dont think they the parent company have any expectation of necessarily raising capital here
8735292 antioquia es un ejemplo para el pa s en el apoyo a la consolidaci n de la seguridad democr tica
8735293 i have no idea how im going to whittle this list down but i know i cant afford everything ive mentioned
8735294 if it stays there and other governments accept it and it stands the test of time that means it must be good legislation
8735295 finally id like to thank all of my political and industrial opponents for steeling my determination to carry on
8735296 you gotta have a hunger to do things and my opponents have given it to me
8735297 in many ways if it were not for you i would not have done as much or tried as hard my passion comes from a sense of injustice and it fuels my determination
8735298 i have learned something from everyone here im not going to tell you what it is because it hasnt always been good
8735299 hopefully with minority government therell be less lecturing and nagging and more wielding of power
8735300 its not a good start to start by crying i suppose
8735301 you want people to think well of you dont you
8735302 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8735303 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick at the time and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented to him
8735304 even though each of the suspects in the anthrax murders was at some point believed to have been a terrorist who had committed a heinous crime with a weapon of mass destruction none were ever declared

8735306 aides who work in other legislative areas have been told that their issue areas are going to almost dissolve and theyll become something like support staff for the health team kennedy means to pass a bill he means to muster the full force of his legislative talents his sprawling staff his longstanding relationships and even the poignancy of his condition it will be his legacy it is his dream health care
8735307 a son of democratic vice presidential candidate joe biden was paid an undisclosed amount of money as a consultant by mbna the largest employer in delaware during the years the senator supported legislation that was promoted by the credit card industry and opposed by consumer groups
8735308 the convention exemplifies the true rot of our democracy the presidential race gets almost all of the attention and every other level of government gets none because we have come to believe democracy is just a quadrennial vote for president
8735309 a voting system used in 34 states contains a critical programming error that can cause votes to be dropped while being electronically transferred from memory cards to a central tallying point the manufacturer acknowledges
8735310 russia did not want this crisis the russian leadership is in a strong enough position domestically it did not need a little victorious war russia was dragged into the fray by the recklessness of the georgian president mikheil saakashvili
8735311 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test
8735312 that means nobody really knew how prevalent perfect pitch is in humans in general
8735313 las condiciones sociales en las que la gente nace vive y trabaja son el determinante m s importante para tener una buena o mala salud o una larga vida productiva o una corta y m sera
8735314 la atenci n sanitaria es un importante determinante de la salud y el estilo de vida pero son los factores del medioambiente social los que determinan el acceso a los servicios de salud e influyen en la elecci n del estilo de vida
8735315 when one calls their cable company for service they are given a time and a date when the serviceperson will respond the same can be applied to lower priority police calls for service

8735319 i became aware of a chap beaming and pointing at his midriff
8735320 then another chap was pointing at me jabbing his finger in the direction of my stomach
8735321 i reached instinctively for my middle button and then thought sod it
8735322 i am sad to see that some chinese bloggers are now attacking me for my lack of respect since there was no disrespect intended
8735323 its just that there are times when you have to take a stand
8735324 a vast and withering rebuke to those who thought that the triumph of capitalism must be accompanied by democratic pluralism
8735325 sometimes i think she has desperate character written on her
8735326 the clothes we wear send a message and i think thats the message i dont think thats her intention though
8735327 we are the only government agency in trinidad amp tobago carrying out this type of activity
8735328 the process requires very tight specifications and you need to train your contractors to use the system before a bidding process is arranged
8735329 however comparing the offers we receive through these e auctions to the prices we get with traditional bidding mechanisms weve been able to save more than us 6mn
8735330 we want to be a model for other governmental organizations who want to adopt this system and have more auction events
8735331 faltando diez para las seis de la ma ana contact al general g mez m ndez le dije lo que yo conoc a que hab a una referencia de sierra hablando con valencia donde lo mencionaban diciendo que sierra hab a hablado con l le dije que reconstruya ese hecho y me diera una explicaci n clara del d a la hora y las circunstancias y el motivo que tuvo para hablar con el empresario antioque o
8735332 para que l ante el ente acusador ofrezca las explicaciones y satisfacciones que den cuenta de las circunstancias de tiempo modo y lugar en que se produjo esa comunicaci n que dice haber tenido sierra
8735333 esta situaci n realmente pone al director de la polic a en una condici n muy dif cil porque sin conocer el contexto de la investigaci n salir a hacer defensas p blicas o acusaciones o tomar medidas sobre los generales resulta complicado y podr a uno incurrir en una injusticia en exceso
8735334 yo no tengo elementos para decirle al general g mez que explique una conversaci n directa que l pudo haber tenido con sierra
8735335 si hay algo que caracterice al general naranjo es su prudencia pero tambi n su verticalidad en estos temas
8735336 un reconocido empresario que tiene relaciones p blicas sociales en medell n en antioquia y en el pa s se contacta con un director seccional de fiscal as y en funci n de ese contacto empieza a hacerle favores a criminales
8735337 evidente que estamos frente a una organizaci n que logr penetrar al m s alto nivel no solamente de las instituciones sino de la sociedad colombiana y en este caso particularmente a un empresario antioque o
8735338 si hay alguna situaci n que en este momento que est afectando la polic a es justamente que el se or valencia haya usado informaci n privilegiada de la polic a para transmitirla a esos hampones
8735339 accreditation by nasm means that the university has met requirements in curricula staffing library resources and overall excellence of program to warrant renewal for another 10 year period
8735340 all of our existing degrees have now been fully accredited the self study process also enabled us to look to the future of the department as it connects with the university vision 2016 and our current ideas are to expand the program to include degrees in contemporary church music and music technology
8735341 taylors music program has enjoyed nasm accreditation since 1974 with each new reaccreditation cycle the program is expected to meet more rigorous standards
8735342 we are thankful for the outstanding performance of dr harrison and the entire music faculty for their relentless commitment to continuous improvement that results in a high quality programs and distinctive graduates
8735343 the music department is gratified to receive this reaccreditation and is appreciative to the university administration for providing the necessary support for an excellent music department here at taylor university
8735344 i am very proud of our hard working faculty staff and students for this recognition and we look forward to meeting continued standards of excellence for the future
8735345 we cant continue to increase exports while their product is increasing at that level

8735358 if you were to meet him you would think this person is unique this person is special
8735359 i can say without reservation that he is one of the most dedicated teachers i have ever had or known
8735360 he instills a love of learning in his students and most importantly a love of country
8735361 i guess because we were studying government he wanted to give us a title of respect
8735362 it was our way of recognizing the tremendous service he provided maine east high school
8735363 he just personalized his instruction particularly in government so that it engaged students in learning about the whole process

8735369 we wanted to show the critics and show to ourselves that we could still do this sure the backstreet boys have put out some records in recent years that went under the radar but the reality is that we still sell millions of cds to loyal backstreet boys fans all over the globe
8735370 touring has always been the no 1 source of income and especially now the music industry has changed we were lucky we have a lot of fans who grew up with us
8735371 they all have jobs and they have lives i get women come up to me all the time telling me they had our posters all over their bedroom walls
8735372 im not exactly sad to say that weve sold 80 million cds around the world and that were still kicking ass after 15 years
8735373 there are people who are mad at the backstreet boys for whatever reason but i think if you were to ask them if they wanted to trade places they probably would

8735766 we saw considerable improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 over the same period in the prior year
8735767 this improvement came in large part from the completion of numerous initiatives that we have implemented since the latter part of fiscal 2007 including price increases on many of our products that were impacted by higher commodity costs for example the combined gross profit margin on sales of almonds and walnuts during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 improved significantly in comparison to the margins on sales of those commodities in last years fourth quarter primarily because of the steps we took in the latter part of fiscal 2007 to exit the almond handling business and to align our fixed priced sales contracting activities with our field purchasing activities
8735768 in addition during fiscal 2008 we eliminated many low volume items through our item rationalization initiative and implemented measures to improve efficiency by stabilizing our manufacturing work force to increase unit output per hour rates on our production lines and by reducing down time in our new elgin facility in respect to workforce stabilization in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 our average weekly attrition rate in our elgin facility declined by 62 in comparison to the average weekly attrition rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 these initiatives and measures have resulted in significant progress in reducing costs associated with inefficiency at the new elgin facility among other things the unfavorable efficiency variances per pound produced which is our primary measure of the impact of excessive down time and lower unit output rates declined by 28 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 from the previous quarter
8735769 additionally the costs associated with the facility consolidation project in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined by 57 when compared to those costs in the third quarter as that project was almost completed at the end of fiscal 2008
8735770 our employees have worked hard during the current fiscal year to reduce inventories and improve inventory turns primarily as a result of these efforts the net cash provided by operating activities was 29 6 million in fiscal 2008
8735771 finally the refinancing of our credit facility and notes delivered meaningful savings in interest expense bank fees and legal fees during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008
8735772 with the equipment move to our elgin facility completed the profitability enhancement initiatives implemented and the refinancing in place we can focus our efforts in fiscal 2009 on improving manufacturing efficiency in the elgin facility and reversing the recent decline in unit volume sold

8735810 after numerous discussions around the league we officially released marcus this afternoon
8735811 this is a painful day because of our affection for marcus who is certainly a class act in emotional situations such as this we understand players are simply people who wear jerseys for a living but underneath those uniforms they are real people whose hopes and dreams matter just as much to them as people in every other walk of life as such we did everything humanly possible to trade marcus which would have allowed him to play under the conditions of his contract with us unfortunately we werent able to make that happen
8735812 while this concludes one chapter with marcus and the saskatchewan roughriders we have discussed the possibility of him remaining with our organization in a different capacity those discussions will continue and of course its also very possible marcus will choose to play for another team in our league regardless though of what decisions marcus and mona make we wish them and their family the very best
8735813 these next two games are very important to help us position ourselves to advance to the final stage

8735845 i understand how to an officer that getting troops involved in humanitarian relief can boost morale it s good for team building exercises and also for building links to local communities but from our perspective using the military to do that is expensive and sometimes troops have not been trained for this type of work and of most concern is it can be dangerous to us if it ends up confusing the local populace on who is an aid worker and who is an armed soldier
8735846 we are saving lives and it is only the american department of defense that can do it so quickly and with such large volume there is no other solution
8735847 we respect their need to be neutral and we re very very sensitive to that and would not have it any other way

8735908 and this brings us to the question which is burning in my mind right now isnt it about time for obama to shoot his goose after all like hillary ford and kerry he has nothing in common with southerners he hates everything they love he hates guns he hates the u s military he hates the fact that we are winning in iraq and he hates the fact that we are the worlds sole superpower his latest push for universal pre school also proves his disdain and distrust for the family and parental control over education both of which are near and dear to the hearts of southerners

8735916 the study has shown for the first time that metabolic response to brain tumor treatment can be detected earlier and faster by metabolic imaging instead of through structural imaging or assessment of the neurological status of a patient
8735917 frequent use of this type of imaging may be a useful tool to follow a patients response to chemotherapy for malignant brain tumors
8735918 it gives us the ability to identify treatment failure early and more time to alter a patients treatment plan before the disease progresses

8735935 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous
8735936 for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8735937 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8735938 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8735939 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8735940 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives

8735942 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8735943 one of the things janni has affirmed and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand is the aspect of turn taking if there is anything universal in human language its turn of talk
8735944 the fact that panbanisha has done this and its accessible even to an untrained reviewer i think is an important aspect of her paper she has looked at the whole social action and the meaning ideational flow going back and forth is obvious
8735945 originally repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language
8735946 traditionally repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they dont have language its a kind of dichotomy or unfairness
8735947 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa
8735948 janni is an important part of the future and she will help carry ape language research further

8736011 the two terms spiritual and theology keep good company with one another theology is the attention we give to knowing god as revealed in the holy scriptures and in jesus christ spiritual is the insistence that everything that god reveals of himself and his works is capable of being lived by ordinary men and women in their homes and workplaces spiritual keeps theology from degenerating into merely thinking and talking and writing about god at a distance theology keeps spiritual from becoming merely thinking and talking and writing about the feelings and thoughts one has about god the two words need each other for we know how easy it is for us to let our study of god theology get separated from the way we live we also know how easy it is to let our desires to live whole and satisfying lives spiritual lives get disconnected from who god actually is and the ways he works among us spiritual theology is not one more area of theology that takes its place on the shelf alongside the academic disciplines of systematic biblical practical and historical theology rather it represents the conviction that all theology no exceptions has to do with the living god who creates us as living creatures to live to his glory it is the development of awareness and discernments that are as alert and responsive in the workplace as in the sanctuary as active while changing diapers in a nursery as while meditating in a grove of aspens as necessary when reading a newspaper editorial as when exegeting a sentence written in hebrew spirituality begins in theology the revelation and understanding of god and is guided by it and theology is never truly itself apart from being expressed in the bodies of the men and women to whom god gives life and whom god then intends to live a full salvation life spirituality

8736240 this fight will demonstrate to everyone that there is no sport universally as popular as boxing
8736241 i know everybody thinks this fight will be a difficult fight for me
8736242 i know some people say that its a very easy fight for oscar but i always do my job in the ring and ill do my best to give a good fight and to win this fight i think i can beat de la hoya in this bout i saw his last performance and i think im faster and stronger than him and im younger

8736267 we could lose a week of production of home heating oil so this storm has the potential to be very disruptive
8736268 to affirm that there is an absolute constitutional protection of life in gestation would lead to the violation of the fundamental rights of women
8736269 the case is very significant for the possibility of continuing this trend in other states in the republic
8736270 the arguments and the way in which they defended womens rights is very important very symbolic
8736271 we are creating a culture of death we have failed as a society
8736272 to me it is a contradiction to sign an accord against violence with great fanfare while at the same time we are threatened with the violence against the most innocent those in the wombs of their mothers being declared constitutional
8736273 this is going to promote abortion in other states instead of 12 000 deaths in a year well see 25 000
8736274 the reality is women who have resources have the possibility to have abortions women who are poor dont have that possibility that was one of the major points the assembly made when discussing this
8736275 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8736276 it was in a set place all night and it would move to the left and then very quickly back to the right
8736277 we are used to jets flying overhead but they are quickly gone sometimes there are events with lights at east kirkby aviation heritage centre but there was nothing on that night
8736278 they were cutting corn in a field nearby and at first we wondered if their lights were being reflected in some way but they stopped at midnight
8736279 so i dont know what it could have been i kept getting up in the night to check and the light was still there sometimes still and then suddenly moving from left to right very quickly in a way that no aeroplane or helicopter can move
8736280 at one point another glow appeared just above the first light and so then there were two doing the same thing
8736281 i just dont see that the west in general or the united states in particular has any cards left to engage russia in some strategic game
8736282 cheney may have a well deserved reputation for being hawkish but the us is not going to confront russia to maintain the territorial integrity of georgia and the russians know it
8736283 the europeans wont do anything to encourage a confrontation with russia they simply cant afford to do it
8736284 sending cheney to georgia and places jittery over russias actions demonstrates the seriousness with which the administration takes this crisis and it suggests some desperation over the lack of good options for dealing with a very complicated situation
8736285 but there are nevertheless things the us and the west can do to show russia that its actions will have consequences
8736286 the public course of action is one of competition and confrontation but on this nuclear security issue it seems were still moving quietly towards cooperation
8736287 todd barry playing a hooker all deadpan like will always be good for some lulz
8736288 jason is a massive muppets fan and is seen as the man to finally bring the muppet show back to tv
8736289 it will obviously have all its old fans but jasons comedy is hugely popular with youngsters so it will open it up to a whole new audience
8736290 if you could timewarp back to 1983 with a copy of
8736291 the album is so complex so riddled with stops starts breakdowns and solos that much like
8736292 what are the highlights almost every song on this album is at the very least interesting
8736293 so is it as good as the first four only time will tell probably not but at least it sounds like it belongs to the same back catalogue as those albums a metallica written the old way album through and through
8736294 ik heb in belgi al succesvol gewerkt met historische gebouwen
8736295 het gaat vooral om de tijdsduur de effecten mogen niet te lang duren want anders ontstaat schade door de hitte de apparatuur die nu buiten wordt neergezet heb ik geregeld binnen gebruikt bij theatervoorstellingen
8736296 ik heb er al minstens vijf gezien waarbij dat geen probleem is
8736297 de regels voor vuurwerk in de binnenstad zijn steeds strenger we wilden het niet er ver buiten doen dit is een mooi alternatief mensen vinden dat je niet moet rommelen bij het stadhuis maar er zijn strenge voorschriften en de brandweer is er nauw bij betrokken

8736299 comme mon amie rosie odonnell le dit ecoute mama vote pour obama
8736300 si vous voulez le mariage la fin de linterdiction de lacc s de larm e aux homos et la loi anti discrimination sur le travail vous devez voter obama
8736301 si barack obama gagne et que nous remportons quelques si ges de plus au s nat et la chambre des repr sentants nous allons modifier les r gles qui nous portent pr judice au niveau f d ral soyez partie prenante de cela et vous pourrez dire que vous avez fait reculer la bigoterie
8736302 cest dangereux cette focalisation et cest inexact nous sommes derri re obama
8736303 theyre saying lower it information technology spending is spreading that is evidence of a global slowdown in it spending this certainly isnt good news for tech overall
8736304 dells outlook is for slower spending especially in asia and western europe
8736305 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter
8736306 its a really tough tech market and dell is obviously cutting costs but it wasnt enough to offset the pressure on gross margin
8736307 what people on the street wanted to see was revenue growth and a solid gross margin number because if you sell things for no profit to some extent whats the point this indicates that they might have to streamline even more now
8736308 the mind is like a parachute it works only when it is open
8736309 de kermis is vaak doordeweeks na tien uur uitgestorven dus is het misschien beter om eerder te stoppen in het weekeinde zou je wel tot n uur door kunnen gaan
8736310 ik wil niet zeurderig overkomen maar tijdens de kermis daalt onze omzet de kamers aan de markt kunnen we niet gebruiken er komt tachtig decibel naar binnen
8736311 the mind is like a parachute it works only when it is open
8736312 so they could see that theres so much more when theyre ready for it
8736313 the destination really connotes the main focus of the trip
8736314 todays data on gdp was encouraging and that is what investors really want to see a tick up in the economy
8736315 you hate to be underweight in stocks when you have an economy that is performing better than expected
8736316 bloody dad that was really bloody im glad we came to guatemala
8736317 as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man
8736318 i see vancouverism not as an individual building or style but as a work by a group of people in the 1970s at a moment in time when the community elected a city council whose mission it was to improve the quality of life in our city i refer to team or the electors action movement led by art phillips
8736319 25 tools every learning professional should have in their toolbox
8736320 im happy the film is being seen by so many people
8736321 a worldwide audience is exciting and a bit intimidating ive gotten comments from people in japan korea and france so far it seems like with a mixed race man running for president of the united states people are more accepting of interracial themes right now
8736322 i hope people watch and take the time to vote fans of heroes fans of hip hop and people who like a good love story my ultimate goal is to expand akira and daphnes story to a full length feature film
8736323 i got no money in my pockets and i got a hole in my jeans i had a job and i lost it but it wont get to me
8736324 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8736325 and the rangers stream out of their cabins they are the hunters we are the rabbits and maybe we dont wanna be found maybe we dont want you tracking us down
8736326 ok take out your englih books and write a story its called what i did in the summer holidays and when you finish you can do a picture to go with it
8736327 of pertaining to or arising from the different meanings of words or other symbols
8736328 state though true semantic web is a bit far away as the web is so hugh with so much of unstructured data
8736329 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control
8736330 i go and help people in rehab thats control how can she say im out of control if theyre going to say im lying im out of control im going to show that theyre lying and theyre out of control
8736331 samantha is one of the biggest problems in her life
8736332 thats what dina told me im reacting on what dina said but then dina steps out of the picture because she wants to look like the good guy
8736333 she wants to try to look good and stay on lindsays good side instead of being a good parent
8736334 what i was trying to describe was a side effect of art and art as a kind of drug that numbs your senses
8736335 art might become a drug for an artist but i am not convinced that it is necessary for all artists
8736336 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8736337 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8736338 star went on to say that she believes her father is addicted to fame and if he really cared about her he would respect her wishes
8736339 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8736340 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8736341 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8736342 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8736343 well when ones lost i suppose its good advice to stay where you are until someone finds you but whod ever think to look for me here
8736344 lets just say my foots got caught in the door
8736345 my focus is my training my focus is my next fight im not going to talk about retirement im not going to think about retirement i want to be 100 percent focused on the job ive got to take care of and well see after the fight how i feel
8736346 this fight will demonstrate to everyone that there is no sport universally as popular as boxing
8736347 i know everybody thinks this fight will be a difficult fight for me
8736348 i know some people say that its a very easy fight for oscar but i always do my job in the ring and ill do my best to give a good fight and to win this fight i think i can beat de la hoya in this bout i saw his last performance and i think im faster and stronger than him and im younger
8736349 a lot of people are going to be very surprised when were standing next to each other
8736350 size isnt going to be that much of a difference
8736351 i felt challenged especially from an expert trainer like that
8736352 he knows my style and he knows mannys and for him to say that was a big challenge
8736353 and the rangers stream out of their cabins they are the hunters we are the rabbits and maybe we dont wanna be found maybe we dont want you tracking us down
8736354 it sounds like just a local flood in one part of the world
8736355 it sounds like the universe formed over billions of years and kinds of animals morphed into new kinds of animals over hudreds of millions of years
8736356 senator obamas speech tonight will be as he himself has characterized it more workmanlike a very direct conversation with the american people about the choice we face in this election about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need
8736357 the toga may have gone out of style centuries ago but after obamas temple speech theyre sure to be flying off the racks

8736374 i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience
8736375 the movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet all the action scenes had a goal they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24

8736384 aber wir waren doch eben schon bei wort bungen dylan ist doch noch beim satz
8736385 also m dels ich hab f r heute folgendes geplant
8736386 dieser sushi laden hat alles was du willst massie wei t du noch wie ekelig dieses zitronensushi im japan war
8736387 claire dieser sushiladen ist nun die endg ltige best tigung dass du im h chsten kreis von westchester aufgenommen bist
8736388 kannst du glauben dass sie es geschafft hat nach 2 wochen in zu sein
8736389 hat eine von euch gerade an den eigenschaften meiner freundin gezweifelt
8736390 das sind die gleichen wie cameron diaz mal anhatte die sind von louboutin
8736391 massie block will den besten tisch des hauses f r heute reservieren
8736392 k nnte es sein dass ihr telefon ins hilton umgeleitet ist
8736393 nunja als ich vor ein paar stunden hier anrief und versichert bekam dass wir den besten tisch des hauses bekommen werden dachte ich eigentlich ich w rde mit einem kollegen ihrerseids sprechen und jetzt frage ich mich wirklich ob sie sich sicher sind dass das telefon schon betriebsbereit ist
8736394 dass man das bekommt was man will und dass die mitarbeiter wissen wer massie block ist vermutlich ist dort nach einem kurzen anruf ein angemessen gedeckter tisch mit scheinwerfern und geige spielern also wenn sie wollen dass wir dieses restaurant so schnell verlassen wie wir zuvor hereinmaschiert sind dann bieten sie uns keinen besseren tisch an jedoch kann ich ihnen versichern dass meine rothaarige in gucci gekleidete freundin ihrer mutter miss marvil der moderatorin einiges ber den umgang j ngerer g ste in diesem restaurant berichten wird
8736395 was kann ich ihnen bringen wollen sie auch gleich zu essen bestellen oder vorerst nur zu trinken
8736396 haben sie auch ein paar 5 g nge men s zur auswahl
8736397 aber selbstverst ndlich doch wieso fragen sie wollen sie alle 5 g nge gleichzeitig haben damit jeder etwas anderes davon essen k nnte denn sie sind so zart alle ich bezweifle dass sie alleine eines schaffen
8736398 nunja wir h tten gern einmal 3 verschiedene 5 g nge men s f r die tochter der moderatorin wir anderen durchbl ttern w hrend der ersten 2 g nge der 3 men s die karten gut
8736399 m dels wollen wir zu mir schwimmen gehen und danach in den spa

8736403 we are disappointed that methodist church leaders have not given the opportunity to their members to make up their own minds
8736404 this would have happened had they accepted the offer from the national council for building a better fiji to explain the charter
8736405 while the charter proposes some noble principles the conference is of the view that the interim government and the national council for building a better fiji do not have any moral or legal authority to impose it on the people

8736417 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8736418 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8736419 a very nice gesture we appreciate that i wish more of his ads had that tone but for tonight we appreciate it and will congratulate him next week on his nomination
8736420 the o will look stupid and devisive if he rips into mccain during his address

8736425 you have tape on your camera oh i can sooo beat you at that
8736426 the day is coming when a single carrot freshly observed will set off a revolution
8736427 io sono quello sempre dietro di te no non devi aver paura sono solo
8736428 and you want to hand all sorts of power to the government to
8736429 the left is always scared of boogy man corporations but their power is nothing compared to that of the government
8736430 oh yeah that was really bad those government folks are idiots and should be strung up by their toes for abusing their power
8736431 increasing flood danger by turning teton creek into a drainage ditch
8736432 ah bens sounding like a royal libertarian long live the king who gave us our property grants and our right to collect rents eh
8736433 the problem here is that someone gets the shaft eventually suppose i own a really choice piece of property worth a gazillion dollars because of its development value i then sell off to another person who buys it as an investment then comes along the king county for example and tells the new owner that the site cannot be developed the new owner is in my opinion unfairly shafted out of his or her investment
8736434 it was the first time in idaho that a person was convicted of criminal charges under the 1972 clean water act
8736435 heck harvey you seem to both trust the government to regulate the piss out of us ordinary folks while simultaneously claim government acts at the whim of the evil corporations cant be both you know so which is it government will save us from the evil corporations or they are their bitches
8736436 but officer i do a good job of complying with all sorts of laws and local regional and federal governments
8736437 and endangered species matter because species come and go you know they always have and they always will

8736440 a wooden spoon is a mock or real award usually given to an individual or team which has come last in a competition but sometimes also to runners up
8736441 well if we degrade the biosphere and humans disappear who cares
8736442 as far as marohasys graph is concerned the scale is less important than the fact that the temperature has increased about one degree in 150 years
8736443 but when global temperatures are presented just as a simple average with a vertical axis that spans the range of temperatures experienced in a place such as ipswich west of brisbane during a single year the global rise in average temperatures is not that obvious because the mean temperature since 1850 has increased by less than 1c
8736444 that plot shows the trend since 1850 quite clearly more so id say than a tight axis plot
8736445 a 1 k change is enough to move agricultural growing belts and the edges of ice caps by hundreds of miles
8736446 sen mccain has always been sensitive to national crisis in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement to run for the presidency because of the situation in the balkans and we are monitoring the situation very closely

8736452 its obvious when you targeted selected some islands of potential buyers you must now talk to them ranking them by parts
8736453 il filosofo il credente il teologo lo storico il critico lapologista e il riformatore
8736454 non basta impedire la lettura o la vendita dei libri cattivi fa duopo impedirne anche la stampa
8736455 alcune false opinioni che minacciano di avvertire i fondamenti della dottrina cattolica
8736456 alcuni senza prudenza n discernimento fanno valere per origine di tutte le cose il sistema evoluzionistico pur non essendo esso indiscutibilmente provato nel campo stesso delle scienze naturali
8736457 questo deve essere fatto in modo che le ragioni delle due opinioni cio di quella favorevole e di quella contraria siano ponderate e giudicate con la necessaria seriet moderazione e misura e purch tutti siano pronti a sottostare al giudizio della chiesa
8736458 alcuni oltrepassano questa libert di discussione agendo in modo come fosse gi dimostrata con totale certezza
8736459 i fedeli non possono abbracciare quell opinione i cui assertori insegnano che dopo adamo sono esistiti qui sulla terra veri uomini che non hanno avuto origine per generazione naturale dal medesimo come progenitore di tutti gli uomini oppure che adamo rappresenta linsieme di molti progenitori
8736460 pi che di teoria dell evoluzione conviene parlare di teorie dellevoluzione
8736461 una compiaggine sempre pi ampia di scienziati critici del neodarwinismo segnale le evidenze di un disegno che secondo loro non pu essere spiegato in termini di processo puramente contingente e che stato ignorato a mal interpretato dai neodarwinisti
8736462 se dici s trenta bastonate se dici no anche se taci invece trenta bastonate
8736463 linfondata e irritante paura della chiesa che un universo in evoluzione attraverso mutazioni genetiche casuali e selezione naturale debba per forza sottrarsi per forza al dominio di dio
8736464 parole di incoraggiamento e sostegno come quelle di un genitore per un bambino pi che attraverso comandi
8736465 il papa licenzia il suo astronomo a causa del dibattito dell evoluzione

8736664 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8736665 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8736666 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8736667 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8736668 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8736669 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8736670 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8736671 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8736672 weve never even met give me a try i know youll like me
8736673 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8736674 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8736675 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8736676 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8736677 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8736678 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8736679 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8736680 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8736681 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8736682 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8736683 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8736684 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8736685 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8736686 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8736687 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8736688 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8736689 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8736690 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8736691 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8736692 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8736693 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8736694 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
8736695 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
8736696 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8736697 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8736698 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8736699 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

8736708 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8736709 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8736710 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8736711 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8736712 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8736713 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8736714 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8736715 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8736716 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
8736717 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative
8736718 if something like this had happened to microsoft the long term impact would be much more for microsoft than for apple
8736719 libraries will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no libraries
8736720 maar aan het einde van het eerste kwart stonden we met 28 16 achter
8736721 daaraan kon je zien dat zij beter in de wedstrijd zaten n veel feller en scherper waren sloveni liep verder uit naar een voorsprong van 51 37 bij rust gelukkig wist leonie kooij zkk sibenik jolly jbs kroati 16 punten in de eerste helft de schade voor oranje nog enigszins te beperken terugkomen en weer teruggeslagen worden ook na de spelhervatting bleef het aan nederlandse zijde rommelig sloveni wist zelfs uit te lopen naar een voorsprong van maar liefst 21 punten tanya br ring ferrol spanje wist vanaf de positie zeven punten op rij te maken en zo het team op sleeptouw te nemen hierdoor bracht oranje de achterstand terug tot negen punten maar de inhaalrace werd net zo hard weer tenietgedaan door de nog altijd sterk spelende slovenen na het derde kwart was de achterstand 71 56 maar tijdens de korte spurt halverwege het kwart was er een sprankje hoop bij oranje gekomen deze leeuwinnen geven niet zomaar op wederopstanding van de leeuwinnen het vierde kwart lukte alles wat de hele wedstrijd al mislukte de oranjemachine begon te draaien en de verdediging sloot de poorten naar de nederlandse basket gedurende het kwart sloop oranje beetje bij beetje terug het was nu de beurt aan sloveni om zenuwachtig te worden bij ons ging het draaien en de slovenen werden daar onrustig van
8736722 nu gingen zij fouten maken en schoten die ze de hele wedstrijd raakschoten gingen ineens mis
8736723 we hebben gevochten en dat was nodig de eerste helft was namelijk bagger
8736724 ci che gli occhi non vedono il cuore non sente
8736725 vero sto scrivendo qualcosa di te tuttavia pi importante delle parole la matita con la quale scrivo vorrei la usassi tu quando sarai cresciuto
8736726 ma uguale a tutte le altre matite che ho visto nella mia vita
8736727 dipende tutto dal modo in cui guardi le cose questa matita possiede cinque qualit se riuscirai a trasporle nellesistenza sarai sempre una persona in pace con il mondo
8736728 prima qualit puoi fare grandi cose ma non devi mai dimenticare che esiste una mano che guida i tuoi passi
8736729 seconda qualit di tanto in tanto devo interrompere la scrittura e usare il temperino unazione che provoca una certa sofferenza alla matita ma alla fine essa risulta pi appuntita ecco perch devi imparare a sopportare alcuni dolori ti faranno diventare un uomo migliore
8736730 terza qualit il tratto della matita ci permette di usare una gomma per cancellare ci che sbagliato correggere unazione o un comportamento non necessariamente qualcosa di negativo anzi importante per riuscire a mantenere la retta via della giustizia
8736731 quarta qualit ci che realmente importante nella matita non il legno o la sua forma esteriore bens la grafite della mina racchiusa in essa dunque presta sempre attenzione a quello che accade dentro di te
8736732 its amazing they help us serve the kids who cant get help any other way

8736735 beh lei faceva la parte della ragazza maschiaccio amica di zack e cody ma ci sono tanti altri
8736736 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8736737 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8736738 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction

8736740 im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death

8736773 a united nations task force assigned to report on weapons smuggling in lebanon said monday that hizbullah has been bringing arms across the syrian lebanese border this confirms israeli allegations that the iran backed lebanese terrorist group has been steadily rearming with syrian assistance and lebanese collusion
8736774 the number of missiles in the hands of hizbullah has doubled if not tripled and that the range of the missiles has been extended and this has been accomplished with the close assistance of the syrians

8736785 keihard veel gerend al voor de zesde keer keer op rij en dat voel je behoorlijk
8736786 twee jaar geleden keek ik nog erg op tegen ryan zon ervaren speler in de bekerfinale heeft hij de volle 40 minuten gespeeld dat vind ik heel knap hij had mij op dat moment niet nodig daarna gelukkig steeds meer
8736787 er vielen gewoon t veel dingen niet op hun plaats ik kan wel zeggen dat het systeem minder goed bij me paste maar belangrijker is dat we nooit n team werden in antwerpen was het leuk alleen was het sportief een drama er zat een hobbel in de weg waar we nooit overheen kwamen
8736788 het was een goed jaar voor mijn karaktervorming ook al weet ik van mezelf dat ik niet de meest atletische ben ik had beter kunnen spelen aan de andere kant het is maar basketbal zwaardere tijden zijn er om van te leren en je als mens verder te ontwikkelen
8736789 hij heeft me meer laten nadenken over mezelf en mijn houding ten opzichte van het leven sinds ik voor een goede mocht spelen creighton mk is het me helemaal voor de wind gegaan afgelopen jaar heb ik het eerste
8736790 als ik niet goed presteer doe ik altijd aan zelfbespiegeling kennelijk lag de nadruk in mijn leven te veel op winnen en plotseling blijkt dat tij te zijn gekeerd juist d n is het belangrijk je geloof te bewaren god heeft het beste met me voor en jezus is voor mij aan het kruis gestorven
8736791 de wil om te winnen blijft je werkt alleen n g harder op de training en tijdens de wedstrijd is het dan nog steeds verliespartij na verliespartij ondanks alle inspanningen dan komt dat keihard aan
8736792 ik boog over kleine moriah heen en al wat ze deed was lachen het kan haar niet schelen of ik 20 heb een verse fles en een vader om mee te spelen is voor haar genoeg z simpel kan het zijn denk je dan
8736793 mijn vrouw angie en ik merken dat het emotioneel lastiger wordt steeds te verhuizen iedere keer maar weer nieuwe vrienden moeten maken vandaar dat we heel gelukkig zijn met onze terugkeer naar nijmegen we hadden het hier destijds ook al enorm naar onze zin
8736794 ik ben blij dat ryan terug is destijds deden we al veel samen zoals fitnessen en zijn we vrienden geworden toen hij naar belgi vertrok hebben we contact gehouden
8736795 maar op de training proberen we elkaar altijd pijn te doen
8736796 dat het t ch is goedgekomen zie ik als een waardering voor het feit dat ik me ook afgelopen jaar weer heb verbeterd
8736797 het is een zwaar leven naast alle tijd die ik in basketbal steek studeer en werk ik ook nog evengoed wil ik mezelf komend seizoen w r verbeteren en ervoor zorgen dat ryan nu n t veel meer speeltijd krijgt dan ik
8736798 i just told him today youre the love of my life i dont really ever say that to anybody
8736799 i dont want anybody thats been in my life before in my life anymore i dont even want them to have any way of contacting me
8736800 i just love so i dont understand when people cant do exactly what i do
8736801 hello this is the answer on our prayers these are the works which god has prepared for you and me to move into
8736802 true comfort and perspective for a misunderstood church planter and entrepreneur
8736803 of course you cannot provide a secure structure and organization when the development of the church and ministry is going as it does as long as you are willing and determined to search for people and ministries behind the doors which seem to open to you structures will have to change and adjust
8736804 lindulto non pu essere un alibi anzi spiegano i due senza lapprovazione dellindulto oggi ci troveremmo in una situazione ingestibile che gli effetti di quel provvedimento siano terminati un fatto che andiamo segnalando da tempo il problema non semplicemente la recidiva ma le centinaia di nuovi ingressi per la legislazione repressiva in tema di tossicodipendenza e immigrazione
8736805 le dichiarazioni del ministro alfano che a quanto sappiamo da deputato ha votato a favore del provvedimento sul tema dell indulto non ci sembrano convincenti continuano ciambriello e dellaquila se accanto allindulto si fosse approvato unamnistia avremmo liberato le aule dei tribunali e consentito una riorganizzazione della giustizia a nostro avviso da un lato indispensabile investire allinterno degli istituti aumentando il numero degli educatori e degli operatori sociali motivare il personale penitenziario offrire pi occasioni di lavoro interno ai detenuti dallaltro necessario ridurre la sfera dellintervento penale riservando il carcere ai reati pi gravi
8736806 oggi aggiungono ciambriello e dellaquila le carceri italiane sono piene di tossicodipendenti e immigrati le politiche di sicurezza del governo si concentrano su fasce deboli mentre non notiamo altrettanto vigore nelle politiche di contrasto alle organizzazioni mafiose a breve torneremo ad una situazione di sovraffollamento negli istituti penitenziari

8736809 its gotten to the point where not taking action is somewhat foolish
8736810 the real pioneering innovation here is that equity is committing to upgrading its existing properties not just new construction
8736811 executives are now seeing that this is good for the environment and its good for public health
8736812 its reflective of the high price of fossil fuels and growing concern about greenhouse gases
8736813 its really starting to drive the commercial real estate industry to focus more on green building
8736814 the cost of energy is going up and energy consumption is going up so anything to help with that is a significant benefit
8736815 we really find that you can get knocked out of the running if you dont have it
8736816 its very difficult for anyone to argue that this is a social movement thats not here to stay green is not going anywhere so you either adopt it or youre playing catch up

8737009 er zijn omstandigheden die het moeilijk maken om uit te wijzen hoe het middel in het lichaam van het paard is gekomen

8737020 ze worden niet met scheve ogen bekeken vanwege hun salaris zittende leraren blijken best bereid zich in te zetten voor hun begeleiding en scholen waarderen vaak de levenservaring en de gedrevenheid van zij instromers het aanstellen van zij instromers hoeft geen crisismaatregel te zijn zij instromers kunnen een toegevoegde waarde hebben
8737021 iemand aannemen die direct van de lerarenopleiding komt is goedkoper en eenvoudiger
8737022 maar zonder zij instromers redden veel scholen het niet misschien moet er weer zon stimulans komen er bestaat sinds kort een beurs waarop zittende leraren een beroep kunnen doen als ze zich willen bijscholen dat is een groot succes bouw dat succes uit en cre er ook zon beurs voor zij instromers
8737023 de eerste dag drie jaar geleden zal ik nooit vergeten ik ben nog nooit zo kapot geweest
8737024 de leerlingen probeerden me uit absoluut maar ik wist kennelijk de juiste snaar te raken en na een paar weken ging het goed
8737025 ik leid een stressloos leven heel anders dan toen ik nog een managementsbaan had
8737026 we willen weten waar we vandaan komen geschiedenis kan aan een gevoel van identiteit bijdragen en tegelijk vragen stellen identiteit is niet zo eenduidig verhalen zijn opnieuw te interpreteren
8737027 zo zien we dat iedereen wel wat heeft het is nergens paradijselijk achter de voordeur vroeger hadden we daar drama voor om inzicht te krijgen in psychologische processen
8737028 eind juni was het een kwartje per liter goedkoper en tankten honderden klanten biodiesel bij ons
8737029 je gooit natuurlijk geen frituurvet in je tank onze biodiesel voldoet aan de europese norm wij hebben in ieder geval goede ervaring met gloednieuwe autos en in principe kunnen de meeste autos het gewoon aan maar veel autobezitters krijgen te horen dat hun autogarantie vervalt als ze op biodiesel overschakelen
8737030 de kans dat onze tweede generatie biodiesel in de tank van een nederlandse automobilist belandt is vrijwel nihil
8737031 in het amsterdamse havengebied laat oad er twee bussen op rijden en een gedeelte mengen we door de brandstof voor onze eigen vrachtwagens maar het grootste deel verkopen we in duitsland en oostenrijk daar krijgen groene autorijders fiscaal voordeel en concurreert de groene brandstof met gewone diesel
8737032 als die er staat kunnen we in 2010 een vijfde van de benodigde biodiesel leveren die volgens eu regels in nederland door de gewone diesel gemengd moet worden
8737033 dat is officieel geen tweede generatie maar we gebruiken in ieder geval geen granen die ook als voedsel kunnen dienen en van suiker hebben we als ik de dalende prijzen op de wereldmarkt zie meer dan genoeg
8737034 saab volvo en ford werken met ons samen en leveren geschikte autos
8737035 daar is het vrijgesteld van accijns ook de fransen betalen maar 80 eurocent per liter daar gaat de overheid veel verder om de co2 uitstoot van het verkeer aan te pakken
8737036 maar vanwege het oplopend lerarentekort moeten scholen de komende jaren opnieuw een beroep doen op zij instromers

8737038 veel pasjtoenstammen moeten eigenlijk niets van de taliban hebben maar ze zijn er niet zeker van of de laatste wel kunnen worden verdreven ze zijn er evenmin zeker van of in de nieuwe afghaanse staat politiek voldoende plaats is ingeruimd voor de pasjtoen ze zijn er dus ook nog niet zeker van met welke partij zij hun lot moeten verbinden
8737039 om de afghaanse en buitenlandse troepen in kaboel te belegeren zijn we begonnen te werken aan de toegangswegen naar kaboel
8737040 niemand heeft de eindverantwoording over het totale wederopbouwproces ook heeft niemand het totale overzicht en niemand heeft de facto de regie in handen
8737041 het gaat erom de bevolking ervan te overtuigen dat de afghaanse regering ondersteund door isaf uiteindelijk de overhand zal krijgen
8737042 mystics contrary to religionists are always saying that reality is not two things god and the world but one thing consciousness the problem with science has always been that most scientists believe that science must be done within a different monistic framework one based on the primacy of matter quantum physics showed us that we must change that myopic prejudice of scientists otherwise we cannot comprehend quantum physics so now we have science within consciousness a new paradigm of science based on the primacy of consciousness that is gradually replacing the old materialist science the new paradigm resolves many paradoxes of the old paradigm and explains much anomalous data
8737043 amit will present the new conceptual paradigm and experimental evidence for the existence of god
8737044 he recognized the impossibility of a non created universe putting faith in

8737051 since i hear that parents forget what their lives were like before they had kids i figured id take this opportunity to reflect on what normal life has consisted of for us before baby in the morning we enjoy drinking coffee together while watching the local fox morning news show during the day brad works and i run errands do household stuff blog email etc when im teaching i spend lots of time doing lesson plans and grading papers the evenings are when weve really cherished our relaxing time we usually eat dinner around 7 and often watch tv while doing so we enjoy the quiet of our home at night as does chloe our cat often around 8 p m brad and i are sitting on the sofa together enjoying conversation and chloe is curled up in a ball in her bed on the loveseat i have a feeling tonight may be our last baby free night at home and were spending it watching the bourne ultimatum and eating joes pizza one last movie and pizza friday night on leap day no less we know everything is about to change im sure well miss certain things about the way life has been but well be gaining so much

8737098 we hope to develop these techniques further and apply them to more volcanoes worldwide
8737099 potentially these techniques could extend our knowledge of volcanic recharge considerably as they can be applied to material erupted before volcanic monitoring was commonplace
8737100 we hope that what we find in the crystals in terms of timescales can be linked with phenomena such as earthquakes
8737101 if we can relate the timescales we measure to such events we may be able to say when we could expect a volcano to erupt
8737102 this is an exciting new method that will help us understand the timescales of fundamental volcanic processes driving eruptions
8737103 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8737104 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases
8737105 since the results are consistent with what we know about human transmission the work helps justify the control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies it also shows that blood from bse and scrapie infected sheep could be used effectively in non human experiments to answer important questions such as which blood components are most heavily infected and to develop much needed diagnostic tests
8737106 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8737107 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8737108 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8737109 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8737110 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass

8737115 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover

8737122 these highways are some of the most heavily traveled in the state and bringing them up to good condition was a top priority for us
8737123 were committed to putting dollars into transportation improvements rather than overhead costs
8737124 weve whittled our administrative costs down to about 3 percent of our budget
8737125 bridges remain a top concern not only in missouri but also across the nation

8737148 as a result the ratio of workers paying social security taxes to people collecting benefits will fall from 3 3 to 1 today to 2 1 to 1 by 2031
8737149 account for more than 25 of all federal revenue its payments represent more than 20 of all federal spending for almost two thirds of americans pensioners social security payments make up over half their income
8737150 is social security a planning vehicle that an individual uses for his or her own retirement or is it a pooling of resources so that all of society can meet the needs of its older members is it about each person saving for himself or is it a matter of young helping old and rich helping poor
8737151 that financial security for the old and economic growth would be better served if governments develop three instruments or pillars of old age security a publicly managed pillar with mandatory participation and the primary goal of reducing poverty among the old a privately managed mandatory saving system and voluntary savings the first covers redistribution the second and third cover savings and all three coinsure against the many risks of old age by separating the redistributive function from the saving function the amount of spending in the public pillar and the tax rate needed to support it can be kept relatively small spreading the insurance function across all three pillars offers greater income security to the old than reliance on any single system
8737152 a central recommendation of the world bank report is that countries should separate the saving function from the redistributive function and place them under different financing and managerial arrangements in two different mandatory pillars one publicly managed and tax financed the other privately managed and fully funded supplemented by a voluntary pillar for those who want more
8737153 the public pillar would have the limited object of alleviating old age poverty and coinsuring against a multitude of risks backed by the governments power of taxation this pillar has the unique ability to pay benefits to people growing old shortly after the plan is introduced to redistribute income toward the poor and to coinsure against long spells of low investment returns recession inflation and private market failures

8737357 nobody has imposed more sanctions than spain the thing is before we didnt have a proper law now we do and things will be different
8737358 no sponsor had the courage and the confidence to come in
8737359 beating the best team in mls by four goals along with a full moon created a weird night out at buck shaw
8737360 this is a great place to get started on my next goal my next dream of trying to get more people involved in the sport of swimming but also more people involved in exercising
8737361 i hope im literally not a fish out of water in that one
8737362 i really went back to our roots went back to our costumes from our original stage shows
8737363 the words for me on this collection are flirtatious fashion and fun
8737364 prices for the items range from 16 50 to 49 50
8737365 i looked everywhere and i didnt know where i was i was way over there and i didnt know where o was so i just traveled along
8737366 they told me she was on the wrong bus at that point and that it wasnt a problem and they would radio the bus driver and have her dropped off at the house
8737367 fifteen minutes rolled around and i hadnt seen my kid so i called the school again and at this point they could not tell me where she was
8737368 its certainly something we take very seriously the safety of our students are our number one priority
8737369 in the event of every situation they go back and revisit and reevaluate and make the necessary changes as soon as possible so something like this never happens again
8737370 a significant number of senator clintons fund raisers remain unwilling to work for obama a nettlesome problem that appears to be contributing to the campaigns failure to keep pace with fund raising goals it set for the general election
8737371 somebody was reading the paper and brought it to my attention as in when they read it they were so amazed by this that they actually had to bring it to my attention
8737372 as a female athlete i am embarrassed by the golf association embarrassed for their discriminatory and illegal requirement the s koreans should sue them immediately this is snobbery at its worst and it should be stopped
8737373 if you are employed in a different country you should expect to learn that countrys language unless you are only a part time employee sports is an entertainment industry where visibility and availability is important to keep the industry afloat
8737374 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8737375 obviously some people are natural talkers and some people arent what if you have a person who genuinely struggles with learning a new language they have a learning disability thats tough to ask somebody with a learning disability who might have found golf as the saving grace in their life to ask them to learn a different language or else you cant play
8737376 theres people out there who dont naturally pick up second languages
8737377 they could make an effort but it would be difficult im just saying that theres a lot of different issues to that its a big step to actually put it out there

8737384 if youre so bent on it why dont you ask one of us to help
8737385 why not youve already made your monumentally childish decision so why not just take it one step further and let your last sight be of the people youre about to betray
8737386 do you think me not saying it will make it any less true
8737387 youve never felt anything like this you didnt give a damn about buffy
8737388 do you think youre the only person ever to lose someone they loved you ridiculous prat
8737389 get back into the goddamn hotel and at least wait one more night before deciding buffys ghost needs you more than the world
8737390 you have no right to come up here and do this
8737391 i have every right im sort of in charge remember
8737392 besides no one else is in any condition to say anything cordelias in tears gunn doesnt know whats going on and poor freds just spent five years trying not to get her head blown off by a slave collar i shouldnt be up here right now i should be helping our friends in this very difficult time and so should you but instead here we are playing out a little melodrama so your tortured soul can feel a little better
8737393 come on make yourself feel better just a little squeeze never mind that nothing will change shell still be dead youll still be angry but if you want to crush my throat do it
8737394 if this is supposed to be some sort of magical reverse psychology where i snap out of it its not working
8737395 im telling you the truth no i cant imagine what youre going through right now but i know what you mean to this world i know you and i knew buffy
8737396 you cowardly ruthless you dont know how it feels inside of me right now
8737397 like theres a big gaping hole thatll never be filled right
8737398 were both pretty pathetic excuses for heroes if you ask me
8737399 buffy was a hero she was brave and noble and good a legend among legends someone like that should never die but shes always the type who does die because well because who else would
8737400 angel i know this is going to hurt like hell but you and buffy havent been connected like that in a long time it wouldnt have been your place to sacrifice yourself for her or her sister
8737401 no i dont but i can make a fairly good guess
8737402 shes dead angel and im sorry i know that if you could have you would have moved heaven and earth to save her but that wasnt how it happened and nothing you do now will change that

8737431 impact kind of font thats always been good you see it you can read it and its a good logo this ones probably my favorite
8737432 i like logos that are legible im sitting here typing these things in and youve got split 7 inchs and you cant read either band name youve got employees trying to read these things when people bring them up to the counter and it can be a nightmare
8737433 you know what when i see snuggle i would think emo just the way its written i wasnt even thinking about the word
8737434 its a long name short and sweet one name is usually better people arent going to know how to spell it what will happen is your fliers are going to be misspelled at the seen it a million times
8737435 the more clich d the font the less interesting it is to me but on the other hand legibility is a nice factor and something some bands have had to learn the hard way
8737436 my hope is that they actually incorporate a banjo at some point id love to see someone shred on a banjo
8737437 not original they need to get some new ideas going on there because that stuff is 20 years old already
8737438 its a whole sort of genre of logos to themselves they are kind of telling you what they sound like they are communicating to you that they are pretty hard

8737491 we are pleased to be through but with the squad we have we should look to go quite far in this competition
8737492 everyone wants to win a trophy and we think we can go quite far
8737493 ive not played for a long time and to play on the big stage was really good
8737494 i felt i did a few bits and pieces that were good
8737495 we did really well out there but i was hoping we would be ready for the game

8737509 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it

8737513 thanks for agreeing to meet with me hows your friend cordelia i think it was hows she
8737514 shes very tired of all the stitches and warnings about anemia
8737515 theyre just trying to be careful and then there was your other friend the tall guy with the nasty cut on his face hows he doing
8737516 hes had a great deal of grief to deal with recently
8737517 her recovery has been inhibited by her migraines more than by anything else but you know so much about the case im sure you knew that
8737518 yeah i know a lot about you and your friends wesley
8737519 like that your friend angel doesnt exist on any of my databases
8737520 are you expecting me to change my story to protect fred or myself
8737521 look if your friend fred hadnt gotten so noisy about killing people or if that little bastard with the camera hadnt been so eager to cash in lapd would leave this alone but we got bodies to account for and we arent gonna let up until we find em otherwise lapd looks bad you know what im sayin
8737522 because locking up a mentally unstable girl makes you look good
8737523 besides you wont find any bodies at the hyperion hotel
8737524 so youre gonna let your friend go up rather than talk to a cop
8737525 the blood on this little beauty doesnt belong to any of you
8737526 unless its your friend angels and somehow i doubt that someone got bloody at your hotel three nights ago someone who didnt leave the hotel alive or dead
8737527 you havent been involved in much police work around here have you
8737528 nobody much gives a shit about due process unless youre rich and have good lawyers remember this is america buddy we put fifteen year olds in prison for life and pat ourselves on the back for doing it nobodys going to care if some crazy woman goes to jail or to the mental hospital as long as it looks like shes getting her just desserts
8737529 since im going to cooperate with you anyway you neednt resort to empty threats
8737530 i assume that youre not going to come downtown with me
8737531 and ive given my deposition the story that lapds going to believe is in that everything else isnt going to fly downtown
8737532 you said that there was a mysterious bomber in the hotel ive heard better conspiracy theories on an episode of the x files mr wyndham pryce
8737533 hows this for an episode of the x files then
8737534 the mystery bomber was a paid employee of wolfram and hart one of the citys most prestigious law firms your missing bodies belong to two homicidal vampires who were paid to detain myself and my friends until the bomber could finish his work we simply tried to survive the evening what do you think of that detective
8737535 and i refuse to play this game with you detective ramirez
8737536 its at all the mexican places in town but ive never actually seen anyone order horchata
8737537 we should all go out for dinner together more often
8737538 i hear that you can get frozen margaritas at las palmas
8737539 plus i dont care what you say its still raw fish
8737540 why does it always take five times longer getting back from robertos than it does getting there
8737541 and i like seeing the city i forgot how pretty the cars are
8737542 this is a great walk and im glad were communing with nature and cars and stuff but i have to pee like hardcore
8737543 shes going to throw a fit if she hears you complain again
8737544 you dont think shes been hitting the bottle a little hard
8737545 oh youve known for a long time then havent you
8737546 chuck is one of those fine specimens of male ape who think they have the right and the privilege to be complete lecherous bastards it was unbearable the man actually grabbed her ass in front of me not to mention her grandmother i almost tried to kill him but you know cordelia she told me to leave it be
8737547 after the wake we went off with well her old friends really not so much mine and after an hour or two of that we both needed to take a trip to the local big nine liquor palace
8737548 between us we ended up killing a bottle of brandy which was probably a bad idea
8737549 probably when did you figure that one out when she was holding your dumb head over a toilet with one hand and knocking back shots with the other
8737550 how nice of you and your little hostages to finally join us
8737551 oh well stand down and tell your little friends to come inside or your little seer gets it worse that is
8737552 ah ah ah prissy british tell daddy angel to put down the knife and come in or drusillas going to snap her pretty little neck or worse
8737553 dru would you like a new seer as a toy
8737554 okay angel you and your people walk through the door slowly and then lock it then we can discuss whats going to happen next
8737555 detective why are you sitting at a desk and not calling those hyperion hotel nuts into separate interrogation rooms
8737556 the guy i spoke to today mr wyndham pryce told me that theyve already got a lawyer besides ive checked them out through a few contacts playing hardball isnt going to get us anywhere on the hyperion case in fact itll make things worse
8737557 you ever hear of a friendly little local law firm known as wolfram and hart
8737558 they claim that the bodies belonged to agents of wolfram and hart who were probably murdered in a cover up
8737559 i know what you mean but apparently this aint the first time angel investigations and wolfram and hart have clashed apparently the lawyers want the hotels lease and angel investigations is telling them to fuck off
8737560 and if you know anything about anything you know you dont want to fuck with wolfram and hart
8737561 of course im sort of confused now see i just got a report from jean flores our missing bodies belonged to two women wanted for homicide notably the murder of thirteen lawyers one guess as to who they worked for
8737562 as far as im concerned everything weve got on paper now it bullshit these tapes have the real story on them and thats the only way were going to find the bodies and until we have the bodies weve got jack shit so in my opinion wolfram and hart can go fuck themselves until i hear the tapes same for angel investigations keep that girl in the holding cell as long as you can got it
8737563 so you think the tapes will lead us to the bodies
8737564 what about the rest of us what do you want us to do detective
8737565 forensics mostly id like the data on the recorder recovered if possible and ben rogers is doing the lab work on the blood find me something physical to link to all this audiotape make sure the nice people from angel investigations dont die or skip town and keep those fucking lawyers the fuck away from me
8737566 tell daddy angel to put the knife down and come in or drusillas going to snap her pretty little neck or worse
8737567 but thats your problem angel and i are going upstairs you five play nice now all right
8737568 im going to brush her beautiful hair and then its time for tea isnt that right lovey
8737569 im sorry to bother you john but theres a lilah morgan from wolfram and hart here to see you
8737570 oh and ben rogers is on the phone for you hes freaked out about the blood on your hyperion hotel recorder
8737571 that means shes in hell right suicides always go to hell
8737572 so think drus killed any of your pathetic mortal friends yet
8737573 i cant love you evil so i figure if i make your blood boil
8737574 you know when you do that you look like youre six
8737575 well mostly i feel confused and a little annoyed because i told you to get the hell out of my life and yet here you are like a fungus
8737576 what part of i will stake you if i run into you again didnt you understand
8737577 but i didnt feel like following your inconsequential little orders stop were here
8737578 i hate your soul not just because its a soul but because it makes you a complete bore
8737579 you and i have unfinished business angel weve been together so many years and you just toss me away like a dirty tissue
8737580 darla we dont have any unfinished business youre a vicious murderer im not anymore i dont love you i never will i want you out of my life and if that requires me putting a stake through your heart itll be my pleasure to do so
8737581 if you kill me drusilla will kill your little friends
8737582 wesley and gunn can hold her off and ill help them out it shouldnt take too long
8737583 unless she pulls the jedi mind trick on them then all your bragging comes to nothing
8737584 all the more reason for me to kill you now and go downstairs and kill drusilla
8737585 this is ridiculous why did you even bother and who helped you get in here
8737586 i bothered because i thought maybe youd get lonely without me around
8737587 or maybe youd fuck a girl who didnt give you perfect happiness
8737588 it would have done for the night it was going to be fun i was going to watch you do wonderfully horrible things to your irritating little friends and then we were going to fuck as they watched and prepared to die i figured your standards for perfect happiness would be lower on drugs
8737589 then we were going to go to south america and have some real fun
8737590 but youre being wicked uncooperative so you know what forget it i have better things to do than hassle you
8737591 all right lets go downstairs and you and dru can go on your merry way
8737592 lets go dru and i can still find something to eat this early and be out of town before dawn
8737593 good for you if any of my friends are dead so are you
8737594 and its only been ten minutes if your friends cant survive ten minutes theyre pretty useless
8737595 call off whatever youve got planned it isnt worth it youll be dead before a single person hits the floor
8737596 i know you dont believe this but i dont have a damned thing planned so why dont you leave me the fuck alone im going to be gone in ten minutes okay
8737597 youre just having a vision its all right were going to the hospital now and you can tell me whats burning and ill stop it
8737598 im taking care of cordelia shes about a quart low on blood and she just had a vision other than that shes fine
8737599 at least thats what im assuming get out of here get out of here now
8737600 dont worry gunn and wesley will take you to the hospital to get you straightened out
8737601 john just so were clear the blood on the recorder cant be human
8737602 not unless theres some radical new breakthrough in genetics that im unaware of
8737603 hell no actually we checked to see if it was chimp blood cuz its almost human this stuff but not quite
8737604 like i said its un fucking precedented id love to know where they got this stuff
8737605 anything else you want to tell me ive got a meeting with a lawyer
8737606 but ill let you know if we turn anything else up john
8737607 id like to know if youve found anything of them yet
8737608 you mean the homicidal lawyer killers who took out thirteen of your colleagues a few months ago
8737609 theres no proof of that mr ramirez its all allegations
8737610 im very busy and i dont have time for legalistic bullshit
8737611 id like to know if you found a recorder and a few microtapes on the premises of the hyperion hotel
8737612 those tapes are the property of wolfram and hart and have nothing to do with the investigation we already have a judges order demanding the return of our proprietary tapes if you dont comply
8737613 weve found a recorder with one tape stuck inside of it but its unplayable
8737614 and the recorder was covered in blood so its part of our investigation we havent seen any other tapes ms morgan
8737615 im very sure this case has been a bitch sorry cuz we dont have jack shit to go on its like the bodies turned to dust
8737616 heres my card my cell number is written on the back
8737617 im gonna go down to the crime scene and look around thanks for keeping the lawyers off my back by the way
8737618 oh my god its burning everythings burning oh god make it stop make it stop hes going to blow up the building
8737619 hes got a bomb things get fiery wes im scared and im cold
8737620 hes a little ratty in the floors do you see him skittering too
8737621 youre looking quite well have i ever mentioned that i like your cologne
8737622 do what you must to me but please let her go
8737623 come on love make him squeal and then make him dead want me to show you how
8737624 in fact i dont seem to recall asking you for anything except to get the hell out of my life
8737625 look darla theres something ive been meaning to tell you except ive been souly and youve been dead
8737626 im tired of you because frankly youre just not evil enough
8737627 sorry youre quasi evil youre semi evil youre the diet coke of evil
8737628 im sick of your whining your posturing and your half assed evil plans staking you was the best thing my boring little soul ever did and it really sucks that youre back except for the part where i get to stake you properly after the hours of begging and bleeding and hurting understand
8737629 lay a finger on him and ill do it temporarily evil or not
8737630 if you dont ill snap his neck i might do it anyway but i promise if youre not sitting on the couch in ten seconds ill kill him
8737631 you two had sex after the slayers funeral didnt you
8737632 i thought you said he was evil like darth vader evil like attila the hun like keyzer soze evil because this aint evil this is joan rivers can we tawk bullshit
8737633 im just trying to make conversation i like when the group is loosened up and honest it makes the screaming later so much more fun
8737634 talk talk talk why dont you get down to proving that old scourge of europe title already or did you scourge yourself out back in the 1880s
8737635 we did get extremely drunk that much is true but nothing happened nothing not that its any of your business anyway angelus or not i might as well accuse you of having sex with darla that one night before you got sane again
8737636 oh i did have sex with darla that night several times in several positions that would make all of you blush
8737637 is there something we can do to make it faster
8737638 i gotta admit my former family is getting a little old and tired like brady bunch reunions
8737639 of course i would so what do you say guys
8737640 i know its a hard decision ill give you a few minutes to think about it and then everyone who says no has to die is that all right
8737641 a friend of yours from wolfram and hart is trying to get them back and i dont want to lose this evidence
8737642 you gave him those tapes are you insane or maybe you want us all to go to jail do you not remember what you you not anyone else you said no cops without the lawyer and then la da da da you hand over the audiotapes that have everything on them youre a dumbass
8737643 id like to know why you perjured yourselves in the depositions
8737644 id also like to know why youre not pressing any charges against this angelus angel guy
8737645 just tell me why you even bothered with those bullshit depositions you all were just having a pleasant night out my ass those things are going to be more trouble than theyre worth let me tell you
8737646 everything wes knows about american law he learned watching law and order reruns on a amp e
8737647 no were probably not going to bother with obstruction of justice but we could very well have accessory after the fact or plain ol accessory if we go on the lies half truths and crap evidence that weve got
8737648 wed like to tell you the whole story but no one would buy it its full of the kind of stuff you see on tv
8737649 i understand that youre a schizo vampire theres blood on a tape recorder thats not human after i finish this case im either gonna have to get some therapy or maybe go into denial for the rest of my life but for now i get it there are forces out there that usually end up being shown on the xfiles i dont like it but i dont have a choice do i
8737650 why should we talk to you how do we know you wont freak out and send us all to prison forever
8737651 if you didnt do anything wrong why would that be an issue
8737652 because with a clever da lots of things that werent wrong can be made to look like we were drowning babies and we were just trying to stay alive and not kill our friend
8737653 i got kids at home i got other things to do than to persecute people who did they best they could im looking to solve this thing the best i can i cant do that if i have to drag you all up into separate rooms at the precinct while those bastards at wolfram and hart tail me
8737654 before i say anything i want to hear the rest of the tapes with you here okay
8737655 you guys didnt take him up on that did you
8737656 i guess being a schizo vampire means never having to say youre sorry
8737657 you dont know him dru hes a watcher or he was a watcher they fired him because he was lousy at his job but look at him
8737658 doesnt he remind you of another posh english boy one with stars in his eyes
8737659 because evil poisonous dreams are much more likely to come from normal people than say psychotic vampires with visions
8737660 and come on people wesley does not look like spike come on spikes the bleached blonde evil guy wesleys the whiny little ex watcher the resemblance is nil
8737661 so what is it cordelia isnt there enough drama in the room for you do you want a nice matching bruise to go with wesleys pretty pretty contusion it would go so well with all the bite marks and dried blood wouldnt it
8737662 i know youre big bad angelus right now and youre probably going to do something really painful and possibly permanent when i tell you this but youre a crappy big bad maybe you dont remember but buffy kicked your ass to hell when you were in top form youre not going to win so get over yourself okay
8737663 how did he ever get you in bed queen c personally id never take you for a wham bam thank you maam you need to be romanced dont you
8737664 one we did not have sex stop with the speculation there was no sex to speculate about ever
8737665 are you sure about that i mean really really sure come on cordy dont be shy were all family here
8737666 so a clothed makeout session probably with a little dry humping you really did pick up right where you left off at sunnydale high i bet that was a good time
8737667 shut up wes fortunately for me you did get queasy right before we did more than kiss twice
8737668 and by the way tomorrow when angelus here wakes up with a soul hangover none of you will ever mention this to me again or i will make you wish that angelus had gotten to you with a rusty chainsaw
8737669 is that the consensus nobody wants to be a vampire everyone wants to die tonight
8737670 im not just yanking your chain here you know that the visions are going to kill you eventually dont you one day the pain is going to kill you and you know it
8737671 youre right the powers wouldnt let this happen and i do need you
8737672 this is the way out all i have to do is sink my teeth right into your neck and when you wake up the pain will be gone imagine that no more mornings spent looking for painkillers that dont work no more afternoons spent hidden in a dark room wincing every time you turn your head you would be healthy again all the pain will go away
8737673 i like my soul i like helping others i dont want to be evil
8737674 you could help me and im your family arent i
8737675 think about it i do well with families until i got that lousy soul i had darla and dru and spike and we were together and safe and i loved well not spike but i loved my girls i took care of them i love you too i can give you whatever you want its not as bad as you think
8737676 why is it wrong of me to want you with me forever why is it wrong to want to see you happy and healthy and free of pain so that you can suffer so that you can die so that another filthy demon can try to impregnate you with his spawn
8737677 cordelia youre not well and hes manipulating you dont listen to him let her go angelus
8737678 gunn you dont want to be a vampire no matter what
8737679 and you didnt try to run away from him or anything
8737680 besides it wasnt like he was permanently evil we were trying to keep him distracted for the night
8737681 it must have been the longest night of your life
8737682 i know ive asked you before detective ramirez but what do you hope to accomplish by forcing us all to relive this experience
8737683 the truth some justice a reason why i shouldnt arrest you all for murder or accessory after the fact
8737684 maybe this isnt the case in your country but in america its not self defense when you have the capability to overpower your attacker and throw her in a broom closet
8737685 im still not entirely sure how you all survived the night i assume angelus didnt need your permission to turn you into vampires
8737686 so why didnt you kill angelus or at least knock him out
8737687 its a bad habit i didnt have time to overcome
8737688 you dont want to be a vampire no matter what
8737689 look man im still not impressed by your so called evil i seen too many vamps to care about one with issues like yours so why dont we get to fighting so i can see what youre really made of cuz any scumbag vamp can threaten and blackmail and torture people who aint on their game if youre so great youll have the skills to back it up
8737690 i almost had the world sucked into hell and you think you stand a chance
8737691 wait was that the time you got your ass kicked and got sucked into hell instead
8737692 in my defense i was defeated by someone who later defeated a god
8737693 and i was winning until i got my soul back it wasnt like i got wacked by a garden variety vamp hunter
8737694 maybe youll find out when you listen to the tape
8737695 i think you people like making it harder on yourselves
8737696 if were going to fight and its your funeral not mine there need to be some rules
8737697 more like you and me are going to fight not you me and everyone else trying to help you out pull any of that shit on me and ill knock you to the ground and turn everyone else while youre out cold then well see how much luck you have staying human
8737698 the same thing goes for you you know you got the homefield advantage here keep that crazy vamp off everyone so i dont get distracted and find my head on the wrong side of a sword
8737699 be nice to everybody no throatripping out or anything like that daddy has to go defeat this puny human then we can have some fun
8737700 do it fast my angel i want it to go like lightning
8737701 ill get this over with fast and then you and i can spend the rest of the evening talking about how much youll enjoy being a vampire
8737702 so do you think you have any chance of winning
8737703 why would i fight you if i didnt think i could win
8737704 because you think you might get in a lucky shot
8737705 youre thinking that maybe you can keep me distracted long enough for me to go all whiny and brooding and soulful again
8737706 you think you got me all figured out dont you
8737707 no i think you think you got me figured out
8737708 i can kill you any time i want or anyone else here for that matter im being merciful and when im tired of that ill kill you and then ill turn you so dont bore me with the attitude understand
8737709 its better if we have witnesses around dont you think that way when i beat you nobody can say it wasnt fair
8737710 what do you dream of when you dream at night
8737711 you dream about it i can see in your head its very black under the stairs it got under your skin
8737712 i dream about a lot of things not just the dark underneath the stairs
8737713 you dream about spiders quite a lot too spiders and girls actually
8737714 you know youve got some serious power in that swing
8737715 ever think of trying out for a major league baseball team
8737716 its been too long since i actually got to fight one of you bloodsuckers
8737717 its never a bad idea to avoid something thats going to kill you
8737718 because it doesnt matter how good you are youre going to lose eventually
8737719 its getting late and theres a ratty in the floors who wants to make us all go boom
8737720 i think its about that time do you want to help
8737721 by the way i have a stake aimed exactly where it counts so dont move and dont mess with me angel im not in the mood
8737722 i wanted it to be as exquisite as the pain you inflicted on me lover
8737723 cuz wolfram and hart paid me and dru to do them a favor and in ten minutes itll be taken care of
8737724 so i still have a question why the hell didnt you say anything darla smith clearly confessed on these tapes on being part of a conspiracy to blow your asses to kingdom come anything winifred or any of you for that matter did is in self defense she was trying to kill all of you even with all your bullshit lapd is going to let you go but i want to know why this drama had to happen
8737725 without the tapes all you have are two missing bodies supported by a hysterical murder confession and those mysterious photographs of us entering the hotel with two smallish women
8737726 shes the size of your lady vampires and a judge would believe her especially with the fits of mental instability she took the fall for you all and im wondering if you asked her to
8737727 fred thought she was saving us all and that lapd would believe her story without question
8737728 shes been out of town for the last five years she doesnt quite remember how to act
8737729 i think i have all the information i need from you people
8737730 dont go too far of course but you crazy bastards have lucked out your friend should be home in a few hours and lapd wont be pressing any charges against you
8737731 dont thank me i think youre all insane and should seek therapy
8737732 youre lucky you found these tapes and you dont have any idea who gave them to you
8737733 i dont even remember anyone running into me i just found them in my jacket pocket while i was at the hospital with cordelia
8737734 even without the tapes they didnt have much evidence to hold her on
8737735 and youre the guy whos going to make sure nobody knows there was a bomber or youre the guy whos going to die
8737736 so angel what are you going to do i think im supposed to leave you here to die with all your tedious human flunkies but that seems like such a waste of my boy
8737737 ah yes so were at the part where im supposed to beg for my life arent we
8737738 sorry i think id rather die with my tedious human flunkies than be forced to spend another two hundred years listening to your self serving crap
8737739 i dont wanna no i dont wanna dont kill me dont kill me
8737740 i should panic theres a man in the floor whos going to kill us and were just standing here waiting to die i dont want to die
8737741 grandmum lets go away i dont want to hear the dead dancing
8737742 trying to get to fred without her seeing me and freaking out
8737743 thanks angelus got any other final words for us before we end up dust and rubble
8737744 then when miss blonde skank here started her bomber spiel it would have been five against two and i prefer those odds
8737745 you and gunn bop me on the head until im your favorite neutered pet again right
8737746 whats the secret signal for that thumbs up a little hip shimmy
8737747 and we dont have time for this nonsense if you want to die thats fine but i dont think any of us want to be blown to smithereens thanks to all this ridiculous posturing
8737748 but i dont like it when im given orders by effeminate wannabe leaders who dont have any reason to be mouthing off at all
8737749 were leaving and not you not darla and drusilla not anyone is going to keep us in here
8737750 if im going to have to die i want you to know how i feel
8737751 ive been in love with angel for a long long time
8737752 were going to die now not later and i dont love you
8737753 perhaps its not a sexual love but youd love to hurt me right now
8737754 if youre going to do any killing or turning i want it
8737755 maybe when im soul boy i owe you but right now
8737756 its time to get out of the hotel dont you think darla sweetie did your bomber do something to the doors plastic explosives trip wires do you have any idea of anything about bombs
8737757 the little ratty in the floor is listening and hes afraid hes afraid he wont find the hole in the floor without grandmother
8737758 im going to come down there and kill you no matter what so you might as well stop trying to find the way out you fucking sewer rat you might as well see what youve been listening to dont you want to see
8737759 i think that you should well i think its only right you let us go
8737760 you shouldnt hurt people as a rule thats a very wrong thing to do
8737761 im a vampire and as a rule we do this
8737762 but i am now do you want me to shoot him in the eye wesley
8737763 i dont want this to get messy and i dont think you do either
8737764 but i sure as hell dont want to end up dead either
8737765 so what do i have to do to get you out of my car
8737766 erase the last ten seconds of the tape dont let there be any evidence wolfram and hart was involved i mean the existence of these tapes proves theres some outside guy on the job hey and that it was self defense just get rid of the ten seconds with wolfram and hart you dont want to fuck with them man
8737767 do you think i wont pull the trigger im serious about this erase the tape and everyone wins lapd can bury this quietly and thats what youre on this case for isnt it
8737768 why theyd do something like this cuz its stupid the thin guy the one with the glasses he had it figured out he was thinking they were gonna see the basement wired up like fight club and it was just this tiny bit of plastic explosive nothing spectacular but instead its just me hiding out and a cheap bomb almost like a damn pipe bomb kids make for fun you know
8737769 that wolfram and hart didnt want to blow up the vampire and his friends
8737770 all the attention on the missing bodies and what wolfram and hart want is proof you didnt let the vamps out of the hotel alive or undead as the case may be
8737771 in all my life i never saw anything like it
8737772 what happened in the end we finished the tapes theres just the one left in the recorder covered in vamp blood
8737773 did you let drusilla get away i got that darla was dust but what happened to drusilla
8737774 whats wolfram and hart going to do to you i have a feeling youre out of here yesterday right
8737775 yeah im giving up my la privileges but its funny i feel the need not to be hunted down like a goddamn dog and thats whatll happen if this story breaks anywhere near wolfram and hart
8737776 look im not sayin that im prejudiced against vampires because you know lapd employees are free of all prejudice but i dont like you even when you were alive you were a low down dirty chickenshit coward who almost got four real people killed now youre a parasite bloodsucker explain where im supposed to give a damn about you you worthless son of a bitch
8737777 do you really think its going to make a difference if you take those unexpunged tapes to the top brass at lapd youre not supposed to have them
8737778 maybe not i think lapd might overlook that seeing as the people who wanted them back neglected to mention that they were important evidence for a murder case
8737779 like you said im gone and if you ever get the blood off that tape im the right sort of gone but take some advice dont go after wolfram and hart
8737780 id love to explain it to you but were in a tight spot
8737781 all right we need to check the doors and you need to let cordelia go immediately
8737782 sure no problem ill do exactly what you tell me to do
8737783 id like to live especially if i dont have to get pathetic and soulful again but if the choice is death or taking orders from a hapless pansy ass like you death is looking pretty good
8737784 gunn kill drusilla fred shoot angel in the head try to avoid hitting cordy cordelia were going to take you to a hospital as soon as angel is out of the way hold on
8737785 you said you wanted to know what happened when we went to sunnydale for buffys funeral
8737786 yeah and you told me a really bad drunken makeout session
8737787 its a long story but ill sum it up for you so that i can get out of here i cut myself on the brandy glass
8737788 the damn thing shattered in the sink when you were making yourself a drink
8737789 you promise to protect each other to be best friends forever
8737790 it was more along the lines of do what you have to in case of emergency situation and this more than qualifies
8737791 you saw speed didnt you im jeff daniels here shoot the hostage and hey gunn drusilla dead yet
8737792 damn didnt any of you remember that dru can do the jedi mind trick
8737793 im out of here actually were out of here right cordy
8737794 oh you can do what you want im taking the sewers and cordy see you in the funny papers
8737795 why doesnt the damn hotel just blow up already cuz i saw it all of it in that vision i had you know the one that you ignored
8737796 and it could be like plastic explosive one time i saw in a movie that one with john cusack where an assassin put plastic explosive in a microwave like a baked potato he blew up the ultra mart that used to be john cusacks house bastard maybe it was a mega mart
8737797 at least its not like the end of fight club
8737798 somethings not right about that theyre going to blow us up but they want the hotel to survive what
8737799 then darla was supposed to freak out and want to escape into the sewers then boom fire and vamp dust
8737800 i mean come now a drunken imbecile could have outwitted that scheme if it werent for angeluss wild card behavior we would have easily dispatched darla and drusilla and left the hotel you didnt even bother to wire the doors as a matter of fact nothings stopping us from walking past you and your childish bomb and into the sewers to escape and then laugh at your idiotic plan
8737801 look bro i dont plan em i just carry em out for lots of money who knows maybe the boys up at wolfram and hart want the plan to fail and unless the girl over theres a really good actress i dont think youre safe just yet
8737802 i think hes human technically anyway so im afraid we have to leave him to regular justice
8737803 is everything you learned about bombs from the movies anyway the explosives are sort of enchanted not to explode until the timer hits zero
8737804 i need you to go drop this off into the sewer
8737805 because i have to go over there and stop my minions from getting away and because this is my home and where will we live if we dont have a home dru
8737806 but when i come back i want something for dinner im hungry
8737807 wes is already on the way to the hospital with cordy and i got orders to take you up to my place and to stake your ass with extreme prejudice if you pull any shit you got me angelus
8737808 how are we going to explain the injuries and the dead bodies how are you amateurs going to explain the dead bodies to the police
8737809 so you actually believed that he was in love with you
8737810 i thought we were all so screwed at that point
8737811 well it wouldnt be very convincing if id just announced my undying love and kissed him like he was my mother now would it
8737812 and after all it was your suggestion that inspired me
8737813 remember when we were discussing the best ways to distract angelus and you suggested that a big kiss would probably work
8737814 not to mention angelus bizarre fixation with me being like spike i found that extremely disconcerting
8737815 so how are my favorite calamity janes and johns especially after all that unfortunate legal trouble
8737816 wow shes handling it all pretty well despite the visible guiltwaves youve been giving off
8737817 shes tougher than she looks kids she survived five years in that cosmic andrew lloyd webber musical that is pylea two days in la county jail doesnt even rate
8737818 and wont you sleep better at night knowing shes gone for good so cheer up and stop acting like such gloomy guses your girl freds going to be fine and youre not the worst friends ever or whatever youre brooding about in your little heads
8737819 what are you guilting about you spent most of this one being treated like a chew toy
8737820 i know gunn i see the scars in the mirror more often than you
8737821 miss burke here told me i had to come sit with you all she was quite insistent
8737822 it was it was like when i was in that place i dont think i coulda stood it much longer
8737823 it was unacceptable that you were in there in the first place
8737824 im here to sing and then ive got to go
8737825 im trying to track this case i cant really talk about it but its something related to our lawyer friend wolfram and hart so its complicated and lapd wants to make sure theres not a big hassle with it
8737826 oh and if youre dealing with wolfram and hart let me give you some advice dont play their game make them play yours
8737827 so you all doing okay i mean no ones hassling you about what happened at the hotel right
8737828 you guys normal no offense but youre about the least normal people ive ever met and ive met some real specimens in my day
8737829 but hey you guys are dealing with it well at least
8737830 i found out about demons and vampires and this whole other world just last week i gotta admit sometimes i wish id never taken your case
8737831 its taking me a while to get used to the fact there are green guys who read your soul when you sing karaoke
8737832 its like when i used to be in the place and id think about being nothing but a cow id get crazy id want to do things that were crazy to prove i wasnt a cow i think maybe theyre like that in your head
8737833 and itll take time but youre right i cant let them get in my head like that
8737834 is this where we talk about what weve learned and how we still love each other
8737835 cuz im glad hes on the path to whatever and all but i really didnt like being a chew toy damsel in distress and i cannot believe you french kissed angel
8737836 you didnt actively choose to be angelus none of us actually tried to do things to hurt each other it just happened sometimes life is crappy like that
8737837 wheel of morality turn turn turn tell us the lesson that we should learn
8737838 when in doubt give em a big wet sloppy one on the mouth
8737839 habl hace un rato con ella y obviamente la escuch muy triste sin embargo se sab a que ste no era el momento para que quedara embarazada los m dicos le dijeron que so podr a llegar a ocurrir reci n dentro de dos a os su cuerpo no est preparado despu s del accidente sus condiciones no est n dadas para que pueda gestar una criatura

8737847 wesleys going to be so disappointed he got to work early and everything
8737848 didnt i tell everyone there was a meeting at 1 30 today
8737849 and i have lots of ideas to help our business seem more like a business and less like a plot straight out of the real world miami
8737850 i think im going to get one of those palm pilots
8737851 i almost missed this meeting because i was so busy working at the lab plus one of the graduate assistants says you can play tetris on them or read an e book and that would make my bus ride easier and more entertaining than fending off perverts on the bus
8737852 cuz you all look like bitter people who dont ever have dates
8737853 hey laura wes has to do work now hell tell you about his magic fingers later get off the phone
8737854 anyway we have a good amount of material to cover first of all its only eight more weeks until i take the examination for my pi license study parties at my house every thursday and like weve discussed we all have to pass two of my practice exams before i take the exam
8737855 speaking of books wesley wanted to address the floor about purchasing a few more demonologies and spellbooks at a discount for our library out of this month and next months budget
8737856 id also like to suggest getting some of the library science kids at ucla to help us transfer our books onto computer when we can afford it maybe we could even offer it as an internship or something for credit and not have to pay them
8737857 i can help you look into that i have a few contacts there
8737858 well first objective of next weeks meeting is to determine ways to get the word out that were here to help
8737859 her name is daisy shes at a club in westwood very trendy people
8737860 blonde short big red shoes blue dahlia tattoo her partner is mark shes supposed to have money and doesnt hell kill her
8737861 not that i can see but the club is iffy it may be run by some baddies
8737862 theres a woman in your club thats in trouble and im here to stop that
8737863 id love to stand around and be amused by you all day but this heres a private establishment and what goes on inside isnt any of your business so why dont you take your little entourage and get out of here before me and my friend here have to get ugly

8737868 im the girl whos got a can of pepper spray

8737951 ive had too many since i got my visions i could swallow a bottle and no effect
8737952 ive got just the thing a friend of mine found this herbalist in koreatown

8737960 when are you going to sign up for a gun course you know you have to
8737961 pretty good actually daisy has this great hangover tea she made for me it really works
8737962 i wanted to tell you something this morning but you were gone really fast
8737963 youve been working really hard lately and i think weve all been a little edgy and its just good that youre having fun too
8737964 i think the powers that be owe us some serious vacation time possibly benefits too
8737965 yeah ive always wondered what it would be like to fight the forces of evil and get decent dental
8737966 i dont understand how anyone with any practical sense could consider scientific analysis of demon chemistry and biology to be a wasted pursuit
8737967 some afternoon when youre around let me tell you a story about a little government unit known as the initiative
8737968 the fact is human beings as they are cannot accept the idea of demons in their reality
8737969 to pretend otherwise is a grievous error and will only increase resentment when the truth is finally uncovered
8737970 what makes you think that the truth will ever be uncovered a giant snake ate twenty or more people before being exploded in sunnydale california and the story didnt even make the la times lifestyles section nobody wants to know that all their worst nightmares are real
8737971 it may be underestimating humankind but it has always been more prudent to protect illusions than shatter them in the case of demons
8737972 that is the single most pessimistic take on humanity ive ever heard
8737973 when you can find me an example of a large group of people handling the existence of demon positively tell me and i can revise my take
8737974 argue comparative morality somewhere without an echo cordys studying and im trying to figure out where the lamdors nest is
8737975 for real yo some of us like to hear ourselves think
8737976 really well ive been so with it the last few weeks its like the coolest thing
8737977 ever since you met that daisy chick youve been on
8737978 well shes into that not like im making groundless accusations you know
8737979 i dont do any of it were friends the most ive taken from daisy are some headache pills and herb tea she gets from this guy in koreatown
8737980 okay i was just checking up on you i do that with people i care about
8737981 its an inside night tonight tracey brought her copy of fear and loathing and were gonna trip and watch and be fucking slackers sorry i should have called and told you
8737982 no except for the part where you better not have rented this tape from censorship r us
8737983 im off drugs for a month lots of green tea and meditation and pink floyd it keeps me grounded in this world you know
8737984 but thats totally when i need to give em up
8737985 she does that no one can resist the evil powers of daisy
8737986 im too short and blonde to be anyone but switch and trust me our costumes are fabulous we will make everyone at the gig tonight green with envy and are you sure that wes wont come with us
8737987 wes is like my hero for being the campiest straight man on earth but this way i can down my pretty red pills cuz i know how he is on the subject of illicit chemicals
8737988 do you think hes ever had a pregnancy scare or an std thats a lot worse than any bad drug experiences ive ever had
8737989 but that was the funniest story i ever heard and he still calls that woman in birmingham even though her familys evil
8737990 all right ten minutes and we can wash this shit out
8737991 freds friend is putting on a little costume bash in toluca lake
8737992 they have something planned i think theyre gonna go as the odd couple or maybe dr jekyll and mr hyde
8737993 this is going to be the greatest night of our lives cordelia you just wait and see
8737994 well you know me always the last word on the subject
8737995 wanna run away to ibiza and have my love child
8737996 so killer hey have you guys seen keith he was supposed to come with me tonight
8737997 hes been gone a lot lately hes on his purification trip
8737998 yeah but tonight was the night he was going to re enter the scene
8737999 hes been weird you know how hes like totally mellow all the time hes been being such an asshole its weird
8738000 shes not sure if youre a boy or a girl
8738001 you like me and i like it all we like dancing and we look divine
8738002 too many blue pills too many red pills all washed down with that suspicious steaming punch and why is every light in this place off
8738003 no way they all went to a costume party in toluca lake
8738004 im sure theyre all tucked in their safe little beds
8738005 i was just gonna ask who was giggling over yah
8738006 oh wow im sooooooooooo stoned and you all are so busted
8738007 theyre not kissing theyre doing an in depth probe for alien implants come on lets get your stuff and get out of here
8738008 oh my god could the man be getting any more booty
8738009 how come everyone in the world gets some except me
8738010 in fact you could still get some tonight you just choose not to

8738012 im into you im way into you youre not into me not at all i get that you dont do girls and so every time you have one of these nights where you act into me its no fun for me at all so id just rather take you home ok
8738013 i think im really into you but i dont know
8738014 if you were a boy id know what i felt like
8738015 i dont know how it feels to be into a girl thats really stupid but i dont know
8738016 can i kiss you one more time before we go
8738017 god i hope no ones actually in my apartment for once
8738018 ask me five more times and i might say no
8738019 god why is my house always the hotel of the masses
8738020 they tell me to do things and sing their orders to me in little bouncy jingles
8738021 only i can hear them because i tuned out they dont like it when you tune out theyre in your head too but you just cant hear them theyre in you
8738022 nothings in me please stop it please just calm down and sit down and well get a doctor or something well make you better
8738023 were all puppets we have them in our heads now and they cant get out
8738024 i was about to break some guys face to get up there
8738025 i just want to go home and go to sleep
8738026 he was paranoid he kept saying that theyd put something in him then he stuck a razor up his nose and jumped
8738027 thanks did you know fred and wes made out on the stairs last night
8738028 i left my bag in the hotel last night and so i came back and when i flipped on a light bam massive macking i wanted to be blind
8738029 youre kidding me they were being completely snippy to each other through the entire costume party
8738030 not that they didnt have the appropriate costumes but the bickering was getting old hmmf
8738031 you should go to bed i can take this on my own
8738032 were not narcs were trying to help you with whatevers wrong
8738033 then whys he standing out there like that why dont you come in
8738034 and you cant help me its in my head trying to eat my brain it wants to take over
8738035 i cant live with it in my head like this
8738036 you were clean werent you before it started to hurt you you were clean
8738037 it couldnt get in your head without the pills but you knew that it existed and it knew that youd tell
8738038 if you overdosed and died the police would think you were another freaked out junky
8738039 they wont know it exists it could get into other heads
8738040 this is exactly what happened with keith angel its so much alike that its uncanny and why would the powers send me a vision about this if there wasnt something more significant than two drug overdoses
8738041 maybe the powers were trying to help you feel better about not saving keith
8738042 something about this feels the same it feels i cant explain it i just know that theres something bigger involved
8738043 blue ds man those things are lame my friend who gave em to me kristin said they were better than x whatever maybe for bubblegum ravers but i know my stuff and blue ds suck i have better stuff lying on the floor if you want it
8738044 the mouse wears hot pink fairy wings to all the clubs
8738045 dizzy is my goddess shes so cool how is she
8738046 so i uh called my mom while i was in the kitchen shes going to watch me so that i dont hurt myself today so you dont have to sit around here and watch me clean barf shell be here in five minutes
8738047 thank you you saved my life next time i see you i owe you a drink okay
8738048 you were staring at them in the apartment like they were hundred dollar bills
8738049 it looks just like daisys tattoo i know its connected all of this has been connected since i first saw the blue dahlia in my vision
8738050 i think youre right but cordy youre about to pass out in mid sentence you needed to go to bed four hours ago im going to take you home youre going to sleep and im going to take these little blue pills to the gang and figure out where they come from
8738051 trying to figure out the best way to wax your legs
8738052 actually im learning how to lose twenty pounds by thanksgiving so i can have moms famous pecan pie with dinner
8738053 the pills are manufactured by a firm known as pinwheel pharmaceuticals
8738054 theyre a new firm with big ideas and lots of big clients but theres no information on these guys outside of the blurbs you get on client websites
8738055 nasa jpl every major pharmaceutical in the west pg amp e the university of california several major advertising agencies and lapd
8738056 let me guess wolfram and hart are their legal representation
8738057 not only that but wolfram and hart are currently representing them in a lawsuit against one of their advertising clients
8738058 why is an advertising agency a client of a drug firm anyway
8738059 well that depends on if you believe wesley or fred
8738060 according to wesley its obvious that pinwheel pharmaceuticals and its clients are engaged in some sort of behavior modification experiment and the ad agency sued when the pill didnt convince kids to buy nikes instead of reeboks
8738061 fred suggested that the ad agency might have brought pinwheel in to consult about an ad and pinwheel broke confidentiality or something
8738062 this round goes to wes mostly because we think weve figured out what makes the kids freak out
8738063 speaking of which weve found six incidences like keiths in the past month all except one of them and that woman annie today successfully killed themselves
8738064 wes is fairly certain that its a mal penz demon
8738065 he says its weird because mal penz have symbiotic relationships with humans mal penz feed off excess brain energy and in return they do little things to the brain that stimulate creativity and original thought
8738066 thats what i said but wesley assured me that if you dont know that its a demon the experience is invisible or pleasant and that its usual not a mind control sort of thing he compared it to feeling like you were inspired by a muse of some sort
8738067 he says that when annie threw up all those pills she exorcised the mal penz thats why she was normal all of the sudden
8738068 so what youre saying is that this drug company uses this demon to control minds so that theyll buy whatevers advertised dont people do that anyway thats a fairly meager return on the effort involved
8738069 but thats the best explanation we have right now without your help
8738070 we think that daisy might have known all the dead kids
8738071 you said in your first vision that blue dahlia was the mark shes the one carrying the mark its not an unfair assumption that shes involved somehow
8738072 i know her if anything shes probably been possessed by this mal penz demon herself we should be helping her not accusing her
8738073 im not saying that we shouldnt help her but we should also follow the visions even if shes not in on this she may be able to give us some insight on where the blue pills came from
8738074 yeah cuz daisys the x lord of marina del rey
8738075 phantom dennis called well he dialed and left the phone by your head
8738076 you were crying in your sleep i came over in case you needed someone
8738077 and to tell me that my best friends working with some corporate conspiracy to control peoples minds
8738078 did you or didnt you just ask me to ask my friend if shes involved in this conspiracy
8738079 i asked you to ask her if she knew some possible murder victims
8738080 i didnt ask you to accuse her of killing the kennedys
8738081 keep going i like hearing my virtues praised from time to time
8738082 i knew every last one of those people who died
8738083 i didnt know they died but i knew all of em
8738084 daisy and i are going to my room to talk alone
8738085 im going to call the hotel gunn was out doing some recon around pinwheel and i want to make sure hes back and if we know anything new can i use your phone
8738086 i dont know i dont want you to think i believe anything theyve told you
8738087 god i was so worried you didnt need this today
8738088 cordy i dont have any special revelations for you i didnt know that blue d did things to you that were any different than any other drug i swear to god
8738089 i think i think i gave you the wrong blue pills oh fuck
8738090 the first day when i tricked you over to the apartment and i gave you those headache pills i gave you blue d it was an accident and blue d doesnt do anything that was always the annoying joke it was just a fucking placebo someone tried to pass off as better than x i didnt even know i had any on me oh god cordy im sorry
8738091 if i hadnt given you those pills all of those kids might be alive
8738092 keith might not be dead fifty thousand fucking cops wouldnt be crawling over my bedroom and i might have got to do more than kiss you last night its all my goddamn fault
8738093 i dont hate you i dont blame you you didnt try to do any of this
8738094 i gotta go i gotta find my friends and make sure theyre okay and that they know about this
8738095 i have people im responsible to you can take care of yourself
8738096 can you go to the kitchen and get me some painkillers
8738097 we have to go to the hotel wesley and fred have some important information they found
8738098 i didnt ask how much time they spent working and how much time they spent making out but i figure thats something well be able to guess when we get there
8738099 i have time to take a pill before we go to the hotel
8738100 im really sorry that we have to mess up your life like this its been good that you had these friends
8738101 except they were all messed up drug addicts who are possessed by demons
8738102 dr charles lennart hes a behavioral psychologist and a neurosurgeon hes been working with a partner a dr daniel naismith for the past twenty years on the convergence of human behavior and human neurochemistry
8738103 lennart and naismith are the big names at pinwheel pharmaceutical
8738104 the entire company seems set up to support their projects oh hmm
8738105 anyway naismiths death must be the reason why public trials for the newest pinwheel product were delayed
8738106 its for kids with asthma its a maintenance drug keeps the asthma under control
8738107 meaning steady customers which would lessen the risk of damaging the connection between the mal penz demon and its food
8738108 speaking of our friend the mal penz wesley whats the four eleven on this thing
8738109 as ive said before in general the mal penz seek to form mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships with humans the energy generated from the brain is excess waste and the creativity the mal penz inspire is awe inspiring historically its believed that people such as queen elizabeth i john keats st thomas aquinas and plato were linked to the mal penz
8738110 but queen elizabeth didnt try to shove an exacto knife up her nose last time i heard these people have whats the problem
8738111 i believe pinwheel pharmaceuticals probably this dr lennart has enslaved a mal penz demon somehow and forced it somehow to do what its doing
8738112 but ill go with it even though brain feeding demons are creepy no matter how many smart people use em
8738113 well theres also the point that scientists who know about demons have a tendency to make worse demons from them
8738114 for all we know lennart has grafted a mal penz to some sort of radio broadcasting system and the static has driven the demon into madness and petty vengeance
8738115 could we talk to me and not each other now
8738116 not discussing private matters at the top of your lungs
8738117 especially when im standing here needing information and not private bickering
8738118 its just how we work together but despite the dangerously anti rationalist worldview being forwarded here i think wes has come fairly close to whats going on this dr lennart guy is bad news
8738119 gunn should be here any time with information about the setup of pinwheel pharmaceuticals it would have been easier if wed had the name but you cant have everything
8738120 getting in there aint gonna be easy its crawling with security and theyre all paranoid
8738121 like i said the place is covered with security guards and theyre all real tense dudes i only got one of them to talk to me for a second and he said that management likes to keep security tight all the time he also said that they double the number of guards on the place after dark
8738122 six on the perimeter that i saw dont know how many inside the fence is about twelve feet high no barbed wire but the guy told me and i quote i wouldnt touch that if i were you but i kinda like having my testicles so up to you so i think they got that covered too
8738123 theres no way were getting five of us in there
8738124 i need someone to get to lennart as a distraction and someone else to loose the mal penz demon so that probably means me and paranoia boy over there
8738125 because this is important to me and i need accurate information from this guy angel might get a little high strung and then poof no witness no admissible evidence
8738126 wolfram and hart laughs all the way to the verdict
8738127 this isnt exactly the most constitutional thing in any case cordelia
8738128 no youll be trespassing and if you get caught i dont know you
8738129 lennart and his goons willfully distributed blue d into the population knowing that it was dangerous im simply trying to substantiate that claim as a victim of the drug my reasons for trying to see lennart are legit
8738130 youre going to get the cops involved cordy youre nuts
8738131 even if theyre not zombie cops no ones gonna believe you over him
8738132 i dont have to get the cops to believe me i just have to get it on tape and leak it to the papers
8738133 when are you thinking we should put this into action
8738134 what if someone else dies because of this even without the damage the blue d pills did to my visions theyve never been reliable i may not see the next victim and i dont think anyone here wants another person to die because of this lennart
8738135 cordy if youre right this guy has allowed five people to die already
8738136 hes not going to be forthcoming about his secret plan to control peoples minds hell probably have demons to unleash on you
8738137 do you think i cant do this do you think i havent been working my ass off for the past two months trying to get this pi license and keep us in business dammit i know what im doing
8738138 you cant let yourself go after this guy i know that you can handle yourself but youre doing this for revenge and take it from someone who knows when youre getting revenge let someone else do it
8738139 youre going to stop the guy who hurt you and your friends so he wont hurt any more of your friends ever again
8738140 dr lennart is dangerous and youre in no condition to do this right now
8738141 well fred and i are going to go to the ucla library and see if we can dig up more information about dr lennart and this operation
8738142 angel i think was going to ask around about pinwheel to the demon crowd
8738143 so i should just go home go to bed maybe watch a video
8738144 or maybe i should get coffee and doughnuts for everyone like i used to in sunnydale while everyone else was doing the important work
8738145 i always forget what you order you can help me
8738146 no im not joking we were gonna go home from the hotel and we got into one of our fights and it was real mean and then i just and then there were the very convenient stairs it was a one time thing weve kinda discussed it its kinda embarrassing were about being professional in the workplace
8738147 besides theres laura i think he really likes her actually i know he really likes her and hes not my type and im not his we just like to fight with each other and we were kind of drunk at the time and it was an accident not an emerging pattern
8738148 angel was saying on the phone you guys went off to talk and it sounded sort of tense
8738149 youve got your got my eyes got your big got my eyes wide
8738150 id like to interview dr lennart about his work for a feature about new leaders in biotech
8738151 ive tried to reach dr lennart but ive been unable to is he available for an interview
8738152 cordelia chase la weekly im here for an interview with dr lennart
8738153 really he didnt mention it ive had this planned for weeks
8738154 he says hes been expecting you here take this pass go to the first parking space on your right then enter the first tan building on the path and ask to be taken to dr lennarts office no funny business if you pull out a camera we will take it away from you before you get off the premises
8738155 the security guard said that you were going to take me up there
8738156 you know anything about this reporter here for dr lennart
8738157 okay well youd better come down here you know i dont have clearance to go up there
8738158 sit over there harold will be down in a minute to take you up to dr lennart dont try anything funny im keeping an eye on you
8738159 i was just thinking of questions to ask dr lennart
8738160 well you can think of more on the way up
8738161 this is harold hell show you the way to dr lennarts office anything you see in here by the way is not meant for public information
8738162 and well sue the pants off you and your paper if you try
8738163 no photographs we have file photos your publication can use
8738164 fine i dont have a camera anyway i have a photographer for that
8738165 look my people are gone theres no need to continue this ridiculous charade i know youre not a journalist you know youre not a journalist so lets lay it on the table shall we
8738166 the blue dahlia pills whats in them thats killing people or is that the demon doing the killing
8738167 why dont you let me tell my story and then you can ask questions
8738168 tell me why this isnt so bad dr lennart id like to hear it
8738169 first of all the project youve blundered into with you and your pill popping idiot friends is far less sinister and far more important you could ever imagine
8738170 these little blue pills are not what you think they are
8738171 you see demons have been with us since before the beginning of time humans owe their intelligence and the nature of it to the omnipresent threat of demons theyve been an evolutionary force that far outstripped tigers or other mindless beasts civilization exists due to our demons miss chase what is the point of using a nuclear missile on a lion or a jaguar or a bear
8738172 yes but what i have discovered in the course of my study myself and dr naismith of course he was a great loss to the community is that human intelligence developed and moved on its current course thanks to demons the necessity of outwitting those who would prey upon the tribe created paranoia and innovation
8738173 daniel and i realized that there was no way it could happen unless some demons fought on the side of humans
8738174 not really a positive view of the species is it
8738175 how well do fire and pointy sticks work against most demons you know
8738176 depends on the demon most of the time fire and pointy sticks are pretty effective
8738177 in any case it was fairly easy to discover the desperate plight of humanity and the mal penz demon after coming to these conclusion you see miss chase the mal penz are most unfairly thought of as brain suckers instead one should think of them as one would consider a particularly deft financial manager you invest a certain amount of energy in your thoughts they take that energy and magnify it in ways that humans are incapable of except in crisis situations the energy they take is minimal much like mutual fund fees
8738178 except most people dont invest without their knowledge and consent
8738179 do you have any sense of respect ive done a great thing im leveling the damn playing field girl
8738180 every child no matter how uncreative how dull how easily led by the titanic banality of modern advertising could be an einstein a socrates a byron we would be gods on earth and you want to stop it in the name of a free will we dont have
8738181 this is a mal penz demon in fact this was your mal penz demon
8738182 scowl at me threaten that youll get me send your tame vampire and your tamer wizard to give me a roughing up id like to see them get past the gate
8738183 if thats all you might as well go and tell your friends how down im going and all of that macho bravado
8738184 im going you can keep rambling at me if you want but im leaving
8738185 get up it didnt try to possess you you silly twit
8738186 how i was i supposed to know and you with the sinister say goodbye to the demon i did the completely unsurprising thing there
8738187 and youre still an evil man anyway i dont have to apologize to you
8738188 i think you need to go by the way found your voice activated recorder
8738189 if youd like ill even give you the spell to exorcise the demon from the room right now and im sure your little wizard friend can exorcise you properly at home if youre not convinced
8738190 that tape is worthless whatever you do is worthless pinwheel pharmaceuticals has concluded that the pills in question while they may be useful as smart drugs in the future have nothing to do with asthma and therefore arent testing them on the open market everyone involved in this unfortunate situation is getting due compensation
8738191 weve been following the deaths everything was decided even before you got here you wasted a trip
8738192 you have an illegally taped fight do what you want to miss chase but this is a battle you wont win ive called harold in hell take you to the gate and then you may go
8738193 and for the love of god dont faint on the way out
8738194 oh thank goodness ive been trying to reach you for like an hour can you come over i have news
8738195 i have to drop the car off at the hotel though so can i meet you somewhere
8738196 i called the hotel and they practically jumped through the phone asking if id seen you what did you do
8738197 ill meet you at that coffee shop near your hotel
8738198 you had a day or should i say evening where are you
8738199 come over please well drop the car off later i need to see you i want to see you
8738200 it was the worst day and now its the best
8738201 im going to go to ibiza next week to meet with the label maybe even do a set how cool is that and theyre paying for everything
8738202 before i take you back to my room and you forget
8738203 ive got a tape we can bust him we can give the story to the press
8738204 i found out that a drug company did it it was an experiment and there are demons involved daisy its a major story
8738205 i wish that werent the way it was but it is the medias going to laugh so a few drugged out kids got what was coming to them so i know how these people think they dont care
8738206 daisy we have evidence we were witnesses to one of these deaths i was a witness to another attempt
8738207 im just telling you that no ones going to believe you forget about it no one else is gonna die i warned everyone were cool dont worry were gonna go to ibiza and im gonna be a big time dj and well be cool well be extremely cool
8738208 pinwheel pharmaceuticals found you they must know you from the tattoo they got you the record contract didnt they
8738209 thats what dr lennart meant he paid you off didnt he
8738210 cordelia youre fucking crazy i dont know what youre talking about
8738211 come on daisy be honest they gave you your break in exchange for your silence and a little help in calming me down you dont have to do anything either just tell me the truth that its too hard to try to break a story like this its believable and whos it gonna hurt right
8738212 i would never try to sell you out with me
8738213 cordy i love you i want you youre not part of any deal
8738214 maybe not but its easier if im with you in ibiza or with you here having fun having lots of sex and not thinking about dead kids or unwanted demon possessions
8738215 its not a bad demon and no one else is going to die i made sure im not a monster im not doing anything thats not smart im not going to change because of the contract im just going to let something go
8738216 dont touch me i have to go i cant be with you you you you sold your soul for a record contract
8738217 its not oh my god woman let me explain i didnt do anything
8738218 a neat bourbon and the lady would like some water
8738219 youre going to have the hangover of all time in the morning
8738220 i mean really does it matter so i have a hangover so i have a vision so i help someone in need there are always more needy people more visions and more people who will spit on you for all the good you try to do and then you die who cares i dont care
8738221 if you really didnt care you wouldnt be so angry
8738222 but it doesnt matter nothing we do matters theres always evil buffy saved the world a bazillion times and she fought and fought and fought and now shes dead and theres still fighting to be done the worlds still gonna end we just got a delay of game and you know what the people were fighting for dont give a shit
8738223 there are days when it seems like evil always wins even though goods working a hundred times harder just to keep a foothold but cordy its not really evil were fighting
8738224 we cant just defeat evil evil is eternal like good is the problem is that evil is moving while good sometimes sits still and sometimes what we call good is indifference but its not the same not at all
8738225 im going to have a bad hangover i can fight the good fight forever and not change anything and my best friend sold her soul for a record contract i wish i were dead or i wish that i was my old self you know i could have been one of those indifferent people i would have been happy
8738226 if you really wanted to be like your old self you wouldnt have found dr lennart you wouldnt have tried to go public you wouldnt be so upset cordy i hate to tell you but youre one of the good guys youre a hero and thats not ever going to be easy
8738227 i hurt when my friends do this to me first the sunnydale gang forgot i existed after i left xander then you scared us and now next wes runs off to rejoin the council and gunn sells his life story to nbc for a swell movie of the week i mean seriously
8738228 i cant even tell you if well all live to see tomorrow but cordelia what i can tell you is that no matter how bad it is having friends having family with you to share the burden makes it feel better even if its only a little bit and were here for you cordy im here for you and so are wes gunn and fred we love you i love you
8738229 im sorry about buffy im sorry about getting into this mess im sorry i treated everyone like shit im sorry i stole your car and got it scratched im sorry about everything it hurts so much and im sorry
8738230 i dunno sunnydale santa monica pier mexico around somewhere i dont know yet
8738231 then ill be 80 years old i thought that would be a good retirement age everybody wants us here hardly a day goes by that someone doesnt thank me for being here
8738232 im so glad to have reached you i understand yall handle cases relating to the occult
8738233 ive been cursed with an ungodly demonic specter meant to destroy my peace and take my life
8738234 oh hell that sounds like im from 1857 but im not joking ive been cursed its a damned pain in my ass and i need help or i may end up dead
8738235 i would be more than happy to take your case maam do you need immediate assistance or could you wait until tomorrow around er two
8738236 see this is why i answer the phone i know how to get information about potential clients so were not left hanging
8738237 she sounds desperate and says shell be here at two tomorrow
8738238 thats wonderful except for the part where we have an appointment at two tomorrow with that couple who has the demon stalker who talks suspiciously like jim carrey in the cable guy
8738239 well you three can go and ill stay here and talk to the woman she said that the curse wasnt immediately deadly so we can probably work both cases at once
8738240 that way we can start to diversify our work and increase our profits
8738241 that would be great we can definitely handle the demon stalker without you just make sure to get at least two ways to reach this chick okay
8738242 yes maam and should i chew fifty times with each bite
8738243 im going you do your thing tomorrow and get a deposit
8738244 this is angel investigations im wesley wyndham price i believe we spoke on the phone last night
8738245 im corinne reidinger and i am so glad that you were able to meet with me today mr wyndham price
8738246 of course ms reidinger im just sorry the rest of my staff wasnt here today to meet you theyre out on another case demon stalker nasty business
8738247 come lets sit down in my office can i get you something a coffee perhaps
8738248 or a nice iced water would be fine if you dont have tea
8738249 heres your tea i hope i didnt use too much sugar for you we only have the packets no sugarcubes
8738250 so lets discuss your case ms reidinger youve been cursed recently
8738251 i should have seen it coming but i had tried so hard to prevent this from happening
8738252 see i inherited my aunts estate about six months ago and my cousins were not happy about it my cousin laura was particularly angry with me probably because i celebrate my life while she locks herself in a room in the house and glowers at all the sin in the world we were in a terrible fight right after the will reading
8738253 so you believe that your affliction is the work of your cousins
8738254 im not interested in vengeance or a family reunion mr wyndhamprice i just need this nightmare to be over so i can get on with my life
8738255 and you can be assured that we at angel investigations will devote our resources and expertise to making sure that your case is resolved promptly
8738256 and you simply must call me corinne nobody calls me ms reidinger except for my lawyer or my accountant
8738257 god no theyre a bunch of dark magic toadies and thats simply so nouveau riche dont worry wesley i have a fabulous and completely mundane lawyer his name is mr bob favreau of favreau and jennings ill give you his card before i leave in case you need to consult with him about my case
8738258 speaking of your case i need to hear about the details and background of this curse and your family life before i can proceed with any results we will also need to discuss the location of your cousins particularly your cousin laura also any information about your specific incidents with the curse demon will allow me to discover its species that much faster
8738259 now if i can get your account we can start to solve this
8738260 she called me every nasty name in the book and then told me that she would do all in her power to make sure i would never enjoy aunt veronicas legacy i knew she would too so after that i discreetly told my lawyer in alabama to allow laura and lewis to stay on my property and then i took off after securing about a hundred grand in ready cash for myself i didnt want laura to find me until shed cooled off
8738261 three weeks ago i discovered a rather ghastly thing following me on a date i couldnt see its face but it was wearing a dark brown burlap robe also no visible feet my date and i thought it was some sort of tom green show type thing you know like they were trying to get a rise out of us but we tried to ignore it we got back to my apartment and started um fooling around thats when the thing manifested itself and started getting ugly and pus covered it scared my date right out of the house
8738262 the whittiers are all about magic theyre old money in the world of the occult i got unfazed back when i was thirteen
8738263 at first it was only when i was on a date then it became more often now i can barely go to the supermarket without the demon following me about menacing me hes also made it very clear that if i do something he doesnt approve of namely fool around he will kill me
8738264 yes exactly just the sort of petty retribution id expect from laura
8738265 i think he gets queasy when he smells vamp and your place reeks of vamp no offense of course
8738266 none taken one of our employees the angel of the firms name is a souled vampire
8738267 i think were through here ms reidinger i dont want to take up your entire afternoon
8738268 it was lovely to meet you thank you so much for all that youre doing for me
8738269 oh well its part of the burden of being one of the good guys
8738270 well try to get rid of your problem as quickly and discreetly as possible corinne
8738271 i dont want to hear it youre both macho idiots
8738272 you almost got me killed and you ruined my new pants
8738273 next time your best needs to include either telling me not to wear my new pants on a job or keeping said pants clean
8738274 her name is corinne shes got a jealous cousin who set a demon duenna on her
8738275 anyway its become more menacing lately she wishes for us to exorcise it from her life
8738276 for a five hundred dollar deposit ill even babysit it for her if she wants
8738277 you practically got your nose pressed up against the glass
8738278 ive heard about that somewhere i cant remember when its bothering me
8738279 well find it when were researching maybe thatll help you remember
8738280 so she gave you a five hundred dollar deposit really five hundred
8738281 i dont know how you did this for a living man
8738282 its slow and you have to pay attention to every detail
8738283 do you know how many ugly puscovered demons there are out there
8738284 we rarely win popularity contests were too pretty for those ugly lumps
8738285 this one gets queasy near vamps at least thats what she said is that narrowing it down any
8738286 no i mean ass ugly you got to see this thing
8738287 its historically called up to protect families from illicit couplings
8738288 if my date had that following her around id have to discreetly go the other way as fast as i could
8738289 we cant have daughters doing any illicit coupling oh no
8738290 and actually there are a few good reasons to occasionally call them up
8738291 i was in india when a family was being tormented by an incubus that a rival clan sent to seduce and brutalize their six daughters the ayanavi proved plenty useful then
8738292 you ever had an incubus after you those just insatiable so the ayanavi can be useful
8738293 except for the part where female chastity was valued not for itself but as a male asset that had no respect for womens feelings
8738294 see if those girls were free to discover their own romantic relationships then the rival clan wouldnt have sent the incubus and thus no need for the ayanavi thing
8738295 in any case this is whats following corinne about we have to stop it
8738296 how do we do that kill the ayanavi i mean
8738297 before we run around killing the ayanavi we should find out whoever did this to our client there could be a good reason that she doesnt know about
8738298 and perhaps rational discussion can convince corinnes family to remove the curse of their own free will requiring us to do less bleeding
8738299 so do you know where corinnes family is the valley maybe can we go over and talk to them tonight
8738300 im sorry im a trifle deaf in this ear let me change ears
8738301 but im afraid miss whittier is not receiving calls at this hour sir you should try back tomorrow
8738302 just a moment but you had best not be lying
8738303 my name is wesley wyndham price im with a detective agency
8738304 she is a young woman trying to live a full life without your petty bitter interference
8738305 ah corys hired you to get rid of her ayanavi demon fat chance
8738306 its for her own good but much more importantly everyone elses own good
8738307 because young man i have some knowledge of what corinne is capable of and you do not
8738308 i can remove the curse with or without you miss whittier
8738309 no im giving you one last chance mr wyndham price
8738310 if you destroy the ayanavi demon the consequences will be on your head corinne made her bed let her lie in it
8738311 the family is not cooperating we have to take the ayanavi out ourselves
8738312 its not going to be difficult at all well simply have to be ready to give it our all
8738313 wesley do you think its possible that youre getting just a little too into this case
8738314 i crush the ayanavi demons head with a mallet when he appears after corinne drives wesley into an uncontrollable lust which should take about twenty seconds
8738315 wesley have you listened to anything ive said for the past six blocks
8738316 this is an old rag ive had since before college
8738317 you look fabulous in it have you ordered any wine yet
8738318 yes they recommended a merlot that im very fond of do you like merlot
8738319 though what sort of fish goes well with merlot i was always raised to believe one has white wine with fish
8738320 you are too damned civilized what sort of fish goes with merlot hmm i dont know we should ask the waiter shouldnt we
8738321 the only french i know is voulez vous coucher avec moi ce soir
8738322 you look like you could use some wine theres our waiter ill flag him down
8738323 ill forgive you this time but next time i may have to do something
8738324 im not really quiet just trying to make sure that i wont choke to death trying to pay you another compliment
8738325 maybe you should stop thinking so hard about compliments and concentrate on breathing
8738326 but theres a finesse to it if you just wheeze in out in out youll get light headed and hyperventilate no good at all
8738327 but the thing is one shouldnt have to think about breathing if youre thinking youre putting too much effort in it
8738328 theres nothing wrong with a little practice from time to time but always thinking about breathing is just as graceless as wheezing and hyperventilating theres the danger of appearing too practiced as long as you have certain limits and norms then it should be all about the unheard breath
8738329 get back foul demon you have been used for jealous unrighteous purposes
8738330 this woman is cursed not by her family but by her own foolish choices i have been called to prevent that curse from coming to pass
8738331 the curse is a myth a lie told to deceive frightened children youre a liar
8738332 mortal i suggest you leave her you seem to have some insight into the situation and i do not wish to cause any creature harm but i will if i must
8738333 shit i left my shoe at the restaurant how did you manage to get yours back on
8738334 i put it on when you were challenging the demon
8738335 i think they might string us up for getting demon brains all over their clientele
8738336 well let me take you over to that shoe store and put a decent pair of shoes on your feet
8738337 dont argue with me wesley and you look absolutely ridiculous standing there with one shoe
8738338 but first to make up for the dinner that i owe you were going to the innout burger and were going to splurge on chocolate shakes
8738339 i think they can handle being without your company for an evening i cant
8738340 its nauseating to watch those girls lust over a great piece of meat without touching it just because theyve been told some unnatural standard of repression is what they should behave like
8738341 im in a much less posh part of town where the poor people live
8738342 i thought you might come in and have a nice cup of coffee or two to sober up a little
8738343 probably about as often as you hear about how deliciously edible your accent is
8738344 i need to be honest with you corinne i think youre fucking gorgeous and right now i would like to seduce you without all the clever talk or games
8738345 i waited an entire twenty minutes before waking you up
8738346 wesley you must stop this paranoia she probably went to get some coffee and as soon as you look around oh dear god
8738347 dont you love the turban mekka lekka hi mekka hidy ho
8738348 darn im always looking for fellow travelers and you would make a cute cowboy curtis wannabe even if you dont look a thing like lawrence fishburne
8738349 so whats your problem did she just call you angel in the morning and then slowly turn away
8738350 no my friend you need a doctor to diagnose what she gave to you and get a prescription
8738351 i thought you of all people knew the meaning of the words safety first
8738352 we were safe and what do you mean me of all people
8738353 dont play stupid youre attractive polite and british in los angeles youre seeing more squirrel than a park ranger or to be more polite when youre not fighting crime my friend youre making time
8738354 but im not a fool man i think this is something very unusual
8738355 actually the demon scene is a little intense for my tastes
8738356 no offense but its not my cup of tea and the lady last night didnt actually appear to be demonic
8738357 but you still want me to ferret out what happened so that you can discreetly get the blue right out of your eyes before the gang discovers that youve got casanova tendencies
8738358 no if youre still stumped about this girl tonight bring the gang during business hours have a drink have a sing and let me give you the number for a good doctor then go to work and face the music though i suggest combing your hair first
8738359 worse than hell or the valley i know but hes worth your trouble
8738360 whered you go i just went out to get us some jamba juice and i thought you needed your sleep
8738361 jamba juice when were you going to explain about your little problem that is now my little problem after we had an intimate breakfast
8738362 i see youre grouchy this morning you probably needed more sleep
8738363 they glow i feel like im in the bleeding dune miniseries no amount of sleep is going to change that
8738364 would you please come a little closer i dont like to shout about my sex life in the street
8738365 say what you came to say and then leave me alone
8738366 i realize that youre very upset about your eyes but its not what you think
8738367 you mean im not infected with a demon virus that wants to use my body to propagate itself amongst unknowing humans
8738368 ok it is what you think but at least its not some grotesque government bioengineered deal
8738369 anyway look i can maybe help you get uninfected but i need you to come back and help me
8738370 im not asking you to do anything hard or even unpleasant and it has to be you
8738371 you know sooner or later youre going to come running back
8738372 youll see when the second part of asmodeus curse takes hold its not all pretty blue eyes and pouting
8738373 at least let me drop you off at work i still have your jamba juice
8738374 the green guy called and said you needed some help whats wrong with your eyes
8738375 well discuss it later for now lets get out of here as quickly as possible and please please lose the girl in the red miata
8738376 no problem wes but can you explain why your eyes are blue and you needed saving from that fly rich girl
8738377 that wasnt what i was asking but i think you just answered my question
8738378 if it makes you feel better she didnt look like she had a demon virus
8738379 man cordelias never going to let you hear the end of this
8738380 he hooked up with that rich babe from last night
8738381 she apparently has this demon curse that she shared with our boy here
8738382 now wes i know its been a while since virginia but you know that
8738383 i know all about safety my god people ive had more safe sex than either of you in fact ive had more sex than everyone in the office combined i dont really need the lecture about condoms all right
8738384 do you really want me to share my running tally of dates since virginia and before corinne
8738385 its a large number im a himbo im a lothario im a player im a manwhore
8738386 theres nothing worse than a rent boy who doesnt know his value
8738387 well she used you and then when you got mad at her she wouldnt leave you alone
8738388 okay thanks accepting that youre tired and the personal comment was freudian slip or possible curse thing
8738389 i really dont know where that came from i should go to bed
8738390 i think i know what the rest of the curse entails
8738391 i need to go home and go to bed and perhaps never leave it again
8738392 whats the rest of the curse are you going to become a big ugly monster
8738393 you see while my eyes are the visible manifestation of my infection the demon virus doesnt propagate through my eyes
8738394 im going to be under an unholy urge to spread the demon through procreation
8738395 oh no no no no no no he said the magic words that cordy doesnt ever want to hear used together ever ever again demon and sex
8738396 i will telecommute ill find a new job but he can pass on his demon virus some other way
8738397 wesley i cant believe that you oh god dammit wesley you dumbass you know what i mean
8738398 and i wouldnt let it anyway ill simply have to stay celibate until we find a way to purge the curse
8738399 great so you decide to screw another client and this time you catch a demonic std that makes you mr lusty can we now learn the lesson that we dont screw clients
8738400 you know if i couldnt see your nipples in that top i might take offense at that
8738401 angel cant we chain him to a wall or stick him in a cold shower or something
8738402 hes probably the only one who can find out why he wants to have lots of sex to propagate this asmodeus curse
8738403 well thats all grins and giggles for you until youre the victim of the demon lust because im still going home ive been on the wrong end of one too many demon penetrations to just sit around and take it again
8738404 you were acting like a complete dumbass when it came to her
8738405 she probably had you trussed up like a christmas turkey the minute you laid eyes on her
8738406 thank you for having some sympathy in regard to my awkward and rather humiliating plight
8738407 well weird demon seductions are my forte and they suck
8738408 but im warning you you put one hand on my butt and ill knock you on yours
8738409 lorne should know a little something about asmodean curses i think and itll get the story straight
8738410 come on sleeping beauty time to comb your hair and sing your heart out
8738411 i hate your demon so much just for the record
8738412 well maybe more bearable when you see the girl whos going on right now
8738413 this is a song i really like i hope i dont butcher it too much
8738414 damn and here i thought you got a little playful with a cute liaransvath demon
8738415 see when you bite them at a particular moment and they release an ink that turns your eyes among other things blue for a couple of months if you dont see a doctor i thought you were just too proud to admit you had a demon thing
8738416 at least not from what im getting from your satisfied customer up there
8738417 shes actually got a serious crush on you it would be sweet if she wasnt a serious nutjob out to unleash asmodeus on the world
8738418 that was about my thought are you getting anything about asmodeus
8738419 not much sex demon evil and horny big on your girl corinnes list of turn ons not really a pleasant guy
8738420 put on the red light roxanne put on the red light
8738421 hey if it makes you feel any better i would have done exactly what you did
8738422 well except for the part with the rubber gloves but different strokes for different folks my friend
8738423 what are you going to sing and dont say anything by the police
8738424 wesley why is she dressed like the girl from twin peaks
8738425 so im assuming youre not here to offer me a night of unadulterated triple x passion behind the club are you here to lecture me about using you
8738426 i just want to resolve this as painlessly as possible i dont want to be involved with your demon corinne i dont want any part of what you have in mind id like it and you out of my life
8738427 all right then but is that any reason to treat me like im an infestation
8738428 well you gave me a demon virus resembling an infestation
8738429 do you know a way to get rid of the curse
8738430 pass it on in other words have sex about six or seven times then you either die become a demon yourself or you get on with your life but if youre doing any passing i want in on that
8738431 not that ive heard but remember i like my demon curse so not really doing much looking
8738432 look if you dont want to help me leave me alone
8738433 i dont want to be involved with you or your demon curse
8738434 look lady were having a nice evening out with friends why dont you go back to your own table and your own friends and leave ours alone
8738435 because my friends are my business you demon virus carrying person
8738436 i hope you turn into a giant bird demon and peck her eyes out afterwards
8738437 if you dont want to help me fine but dont expect me to do anything for you otherwise
8738438 yeesh do the words psycho hose beast ring a bell
8738439 and now i have to call and apologize to her cousin to see if she knows more about the curse of asmodeus
8738440 and shes not really so pretty once you look at her
8738441 but that doesnt matter because shes a total psychotic skank at least her cousin isnt a skank right just an uber bitch with serious attitude and a predisposition to hate you
8738442 i die a reeking demon shell after tormenting innocent people throughout the city with my unnatural desires
8738443 did i do that during any of my many demon impregnation moments this is just your first time at least if the worst happens youre not going to be split in two by your unholy demon spawn youre not are you
8738444 wes wait i have an idea are you still on friendly terms with virginia
8738445 do you think virginias family might know these southern vengeance hicks
8738446 i cant believe that spiteful little whore did that to you
8738447 freaking corinne reidinger i remember when we were fifteen and she tried to get the demon anyanka to turn my hair into a nest of poisonous asps for stealing her boyfriend that slut that evil whore
8738448 i need to go to birmingham and visit laura whittier i could use information directions a letter of introduction
8738449 lauras in town at a medievalist conference at ucla just got in yesterday shes really old fashioned and sort of a prude but all in all shes a pretty cool lady
8738450 come on ill take you to meet her maybe shell be nicer to you with me around
8738451 that might not be a good idea considering my condition
8738452 maybe someday when youre not cursed you could come by and we could talk
8738453 i spoke to you the other night and i need to apologize and speak to you about something quite urgent
8738454 youre that man from last night arent you whered you get this number
8738455 please please dont i dont have any ulterior motives i just need to speak with you i got the number from a friend virginia bryce is a friend of mine
8738456 oh so youre that cute ex of hers and the detective from the other night oh well i know a few things about you let me come down to the lobby ill be wearing khaki jodphurs
8738457 all right ill be the younger fellow in specs looking grievously out of place
8738458 its so good of you to visit me while im at the conference
8738459 im in the corolla over there so tell me have you heard the new yo yo ma cd
8738460 so youre wesley wyndham price i presume and arent you edmunds boy
8738461 must confess though and take no offense please your dads a prat is he always such a soul sucking little man
8738462 pity hes clever enough but no one can bear to be near him with the apparent exception of your mum
8738463 one of his grad students is submitting a piece here so i was reminded of him
8738464 look laura im sorry about that idiotic phone call the other night
8738465 most of these poor idiots dont even know whats happened to them and do exactly what she says anyway you have the courage to admit youre in a mess and that you could use some help besides ginny bryce adores you and ginny has good taste
8738466 corinne is trying to inveigle you back in her clutches for a very specific reason of course she is attempting to produce a living vessel for asmodeus to inhabit it takes two infected victims and a shitload of ritual and youre the only one she likes enough to do the rituals with plus she thinks it would be a cute demon baby
8738467 you mean she wants me to oh god is she mad
8738468 so you must be curious about what to do to end the curse
8738469 howd you get here should we get your car before we go to well wherever youre based out of
8738470 my family is old and southern and we were cursed by one of our former slaves a century or two back we deserved it and the one who cursed us had a particularly appropriate sense of humor my forefathers were not admirable people and so one of their victims decided to make it known for all time that my family was a bunch of lustful rapists
8738471 we all reformed fairly quickly after that losing your best and brightest to a curse than can kill or transmogrify forces drastic actions
8738472 i didnt know until i was sixteen what my parents had done and i tried to kill myself when i discovered what had happened
8738473 he deserved a life that wasnt hobbled by this curse ive never stopped regretting that they chose him
8738474 you didnt try to find any other way to stop the curse
8738475 but short of doing what corinnes doing which is trying to bring asmodeus into human form there wasnt anything i found that would work
8738476 how did corinne get infected if shes not really a whittier
8738477 while the curse is primarily spread through sexual contagion one can also become infected by drinking a sufficient quantity of a cursed persons blood
8738478 my mothers im assuming i dont know when i hadnt seen her in five years when i saw her at the funeral with those eyes
8738479 but it could have been either your mother or lewis
8738480 yes it could have been but it wasnt it had to be my mother
8738481 lewis is my twin brother more than that hes my best friend
8738482 corinne is greedy shes formed this plan simply because she wants more power and more money and shes sure asmodeus can give it to her my god i wish wed shown her the power of the stock market instead
8738483 do you think your coworkers will have a problem with me taking charge of this research
8738484 i do have a degree in this sort of thing and i love research
8738485 for they knew not how boring and self important they were in thy service
8738486 every time i try to read those i get sleepy
8738487 you see theres a spell on them to make anyone reading these lose interest if theyre not part of a certain monastic order or good enough at magic to break the spell
8738488 so you mean that all of these dusty books are interesting
8738489 some are some arent but all of them are enspelled to make you think theyre dusty yawners
8738490 i havent been able to find much either most of the demons i talked to think asmodeus is a has been or theyve never heard of him none of them had anything to say about the curse
8738491 either that or theyre all extraordinarily stupid i know for a fact a cell of his worshippers run a disreputable movie studio in west hollywood
8738492 but thats your deal i have to get back to my hotel
8738493 i have a ten thirty presentation for my conference paper rethinking christianity and magic in 11th century benedictine monasteries at ucla and if laura doesnt sleep laura doesnt speak in the mornings its almost embarrassing
8738494 so im going to motor dont worry ill call yall after the presentation
8738495 in my defense though i thought she was going to be much older and less like indiana jones with breasts
8738496 sorry to break into the we love dr laura moment but we either need to pack it up for the night or get back to researching wesleys eyes not getting any less blue with us standing here
8738497 i dont think research is going to help us cordy
8738498 every tiny bit of information we get suggests we know everything there is to know about the curse
8738499 so what does that mean that youre going to join up with corinne or become a demon bird man or die
8738500 it means that unless we find groundbreaking new information at this west hollywood studio we need to do what we did to the ayavani demon force it to manifest and destroy it kill the source and you destroy the curse
8738501 but this asmodeus guy isnt he like a demon prince
8738502 killing him isnt going to be as easy as having angel do his gallagher impersonation
8738503 no dont hang up its so good to hear your voice hi mum
8738504 i didnt get to speak with you when you called on dads birthday and ive so much wanted to
8738505 then last night i got one of my feelings and i knew i had to talk to you immediately are you all right dear
8738506 actually im in a bit of a mess right now mum
8738507 do you need money dont listen to your father on the topic we just came into a tidy sum an american chappie bought a rare old book from us
8738508 of course dear the book was an accurate demonology and spellbook your dad doesnt just sell those to anyone
8738509 he was a very nice man a collector his name was lewis whittier i believe yes lewis from alabama his sister is a noted historian in the field of occult history she corresponds with your dad on occasion dr laura whittier heard of her
8738510 ive actually met laura just recently lovely family for the most part
8738511 lewis thinks the world of her corinne something he says she lives in los angeles maybe the two of you could have lunch sometime shes really quite a lovely girl i understand
8738512 oh i didnt call you to set you up on a date
8738513 i called to tell you how proud i am of you your dad was going on about how youve quit the watchers and ended up with a motley bunch of nobodies but you know your dad he wanted to be a watcher and didnt cut it so hes a bit cracked over it of course
8738514 but i wanted to say that i dont care if you left the watchers bunch of ponces in my book you sound like youre doing wonderful things with good people and youre happy ive never been prouder of you wesley you live your life your way and tell us to piss off all right
8738515 no we just made forty five hundred on our last case
8738516 well then i shall leave you alone to get a few more minutes of sleep i love you
8738517 lewis you better not have broken him ill be hella pissed off
8738518 you must realize that having me at your house is simply a bad idea dont you lauras going to have the cops on you in twenty seconds flat
8738519 i was sure it was the first thing you were gonna say
8738520 you wont get away with this angel will stop you
8738521 you wankers okay not the wankers part but i just like that word
8738522 you are a callow weak willed girl whom lewis and asmodeus will tear apart as soon as youre unnecessary if youd prefer to live youll let laura and me go
8738523 all they ever do is play games i was part of their favorite game convince cory to take sides
8738524 funny thing though i dont seem to be chained up
8738525 wheres my false bravado where are the one liners i can get pokey things out i only need one part of you to work you know and theres lots of ways to hurt people
8738526 cut out the bitchs lying tongue yes with deep pleasure and deeper pride
8738527 because hes the chosen vessel of lord asmodeus manifestation dumbass
8738528 if the cavalry doesnt get here before asmodeus were fucked in ways youve never experienced before
8738529 well maybe not you personally but you get the point
8738530 how did i go from being the progenitor of asmodeus earthly incarnation to being the incarnation
8738531 im very sorry lewis found this ritual in the demonology he just bought before that wed been using really bad sources that made the ritual sound totally different
8738532 all i know is that it involves you me a cursed circle some bright light and a lot of virgin blood
8738533 what do you think i was trying to be natural about it
8738534 but i dont want you to i mean its not you shouldnt have to do this
8738535 well you cant have virgin blood if you dont have a virgin
8738536 i dont want to do this but i dont want to die
8738537 no i dont but we dont have much choice do we unless you want to be a demon
8738538 all right but if you change your mind tell me please tell me
8738539 weve got to be fast though they could come back at any time
8738540 all right all right im just trying not to do anything well regret
8738541 ive done so much work denying my demonically enhanced libido that ive actually managed to repress it except once or twice a month
8738542 i channeled it into my work its worked really well until now when i need to fuck and run on short notice so why arent you going crazy
8738543 i would like very much to be making love to you right now except that its wrong and i think youre too nice of a person to throw on her back and go at it with like a rabbit virgin blood or not
8738544 me come on laura do you even need to ask
8738545 you two were so sweet but sweet merciful jesus kids you might have actually managed it if youd shut up and just gotten down the demon curse thing is great aphrodisiac you can forget just about anything when youre in the throes of demonic passion
8738546 sometimes the best thing to do is the thing that seems the stupidest option at the time
8738547 sometimes you know the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it
8738548 do you really think he wants to share any rewards asmodeus will give to him
8738549 and for how long will he keep needing you with his sugar daddy asmodeus around
8738550 you were a team you did the work and now hell do the profiting
8738551 youre just trying to turn me against lewis to save your own neck
8738552 it wont work wesley lewis and i are a team
8738553 dont you think i knew youd try that fucking spell dont you think i know everything you taught me
8738554 come on wesley it cant be good for innocent virginal lauras internal organs to suffer this repeated trauma
8738555 why cant you just do what youre supposed to do youre just going to need to do it in the end anyway
8738556 the time draws nigh the darth vader musics a playing and you my delicious heroic british dish are going to become the demon i always wanted
8738557 come on laura wake up were out of time come on laura wake up laura
8738558 dont do this come on i need your help dont die laura dont die on me here
8738559 laura i dont know where you are right now but im alone without you i dont know if i can stop lewis and corinne without some help
8738560 please god laura if you can hear me i need a little help so that i can do what i can to stop this from happening
8738561 lewis is coming now apparently its time to rock and roll
8738562 theres no more time for games lord asmodeus cries out for rebirth
8738563 are you sure that he cant take a rain check
8738564 lewis hes being a total pain in the ass again
8738565 lewis you motherfucking son of a whelp hes not part of this hes not a whittier leave him alone and use me instead
8738566 if i gave a damn about what you say i might even be persuaded but guess what big sister nothing you say will change anything i do lord asmodeus wants him lord asmodeus gets him
8738567 we would have all been fucked if it werent for your psychotic sexual hang ups
8738568 what have i said about revealing details of the plan
8738569 is this the part where we start chanting in latin lewis
8738570 so wesley was that the expected or unexpected thing to do
8738571 i said was that the expected or unexpected thing to do
8738572 sorry lewis but wesley was right theres not enough lord asmodeus for two
8738573 but ill be rewarded for it once lord asmodeus rises
8738574 but ive considered the odds and its an acceptable risk with high levels of payoff
8738575 i have to bleed laura now and then its time to prepare the you sweetheart and then its time to call down the spirit of my demon lord its the basic bad guy litany so just get comfortable hey laura hows your brain
8738576 thy servant gives to thee a gift of pure blood taken from her enemy and one who has betrayed thee
8738577 for thee o lord asmodeus i anoint the chosen one with pure blood given to thee and bitter ash
8738578 it wont be demons are notoriously bad at fulfilling expectations
8738579 and your soul will eat away at you for the pain youve caused innocent people and for the wrongful deaths of your cousins
8738580 im corinne i found you a great human form the anointed one over there isnt he great
8738581 you are lucky little one that i have embraced the virtue of simplicity or i might have had to smite your head off for speaking to me so disrespectfully and yes hes great good pick corinne
8738582 i was getting impatient with the time it took to draw you from the depths of the underworld so my manners are a little off
8738583 so this is to be my new form not bad at all cute smart definitely full of promise and well make a great couple my ascent into power will be rapid with such a smart and attractive avatar
8738584 hes got the brains ive got the looks and well make a lot of money sir
8738585 he got an injury earlier when the sacrifice kicked him in the head
8738586 all of this has taken place without my consent i do not want to be your incarnation i want to be free of your curse
8738587 so if you could just get corinne to unchain me im sure i can find
8738588 would you like me to do something for you in this moment of triumph lord asmodeus
8738589 yes young one find my incarnation some better clothes and something to clean off the blood and ashes with i dont want to look like a scrub in my moment of glory
8738590 but before you possess my friend i should mention hes really not fit for a demon lord i mean look at this guy
8738591 thats because youre listening to one of his girlfriends i work with wes and im telling you hes not demon lord material
8738592 gunns getting you loose and then we need you to read some latin to dispel asmodeus
8738593 have i told you about the time he tried to be me hes supposed to protect this girl for her father and what does he end up doing getting it on
8738594 i know youre fond of the prurient side of life but you wont even be able to function when youre in this body
8738595 because the entire adventure has been an exercise in preserving your dignity
8738596 shut up and let angel distract the blue light special
8738597 uh there was an accident it sort of went poof
8738598 your ploy has at last bored me though it was amusing at first i will now take possession of my vessel as i have been waiting to do for the last fifteen minutes while your minions made a pathetic attempt to stay my hand
8738599 that was polite of him to listen for so long
8738600 im not very trustworthy i think im actually quite mad you probably should have chosen a saner priestess anyway and ive always wanted to say this to a demon you are the weakest link gbye
8738601 shes in shock and she has a concussion and the blood loss
8738602 freds outside with lapd cordy convinced em to stay outside until we gave the signal
8738603 wesley she killed lewis lewis was working with her and she killed him lewis is dead
8738604 what do you mean im under arrest i just saved us all from big trouble officer big trouble oh right all that stuff i allegedly did you mean im really culpable for that
8738605 not the curse not the things my parents did to try to prevent it none of it not even corinne deserved what happened to her
8738606 but we have to live somehow sometimes bad things happen to good people and more often good things happen to people who dont deserve it
8738607 and we have to try to be worthy of the good things right
8738608 fair enough i guess i dont deserve to be the one free of the curse but i am so im going to stop feeling guilty and live
8738609 i realized that lewis hated the hell out of laura when i first came to live with them but that laura had the right idea however i had to keep lewis from killing laura so i pretended to side with him that was before he cut his wrist and stuck it in my mouth one night
8738610 yeah that sucked it kind of drove me a little crazy thats why im cool with being in here anyhow after i got infected i decided that i had to get drastic because i wanted to have sex again you know you were the first guy i had sex with in a year damn i was horny it made get a little overboard
8738611 so then i had lewis find me books and we looked and looked and looked and then we found the one your dad had lying about and that was the key to everything lewis thought we were just going to you know call up the crazy evil demon lord however the book had the key to banishing asmodeus for all time but i couldnt risk trying my plan to banish asmodeus on a family member because theyre crazy and southern
8738612 anyway to make a long story short i planned the little fight with laura at the funeral so that she would get pissy and set an ayanavi on me because laura had the prissy virgin thing going on that way i had a legitimate excuse to get to you
8738613 so i was part of your scheme the whole time
8738614 well no only after i saw you in that article with virginia bryce that snatch
8738615 i realized you would be a very very attractive host for lord asmodeus and so i ran with it not bad hmm
8738616 we could have avoided all of this if youd just been a professional and not boinked a client
8738617 said client was a professional nutjob who used dark enchantments to lure me into a compromising position and then got homicidal
8738618 yeah but i bet you would have had sex with her anyway
8738619 you were a drool puppy the minute you laid eyes on her hey speaking of clients hows her cousin
8738620 she left me her phone number in birmingham when she paid us
8738621 im supposed to look her up sometime she wants to have lunch
8738622 well probably but i dont think ill be up for trips to birmingham for a while
8738623 ok youre cute but youre also a total dork no offense but its true so how come you have the harem
8738624 in my defense i was a bigger dork when i was madly infatuated with you in sunnydale and a terrible kisser
8738625 youre prejudiced you knew me when i was a total dolt it took me a while to become the suave gent you see before you
8738626 you were cute for a giant dork and you werent xander
8738627 but you are a terrible kisser and youre suave like angels a good singer
8738628 im a lot better now seriously if you werent practically my sister id show you just for the sake of argument
8738629 fine ok you are so on one kiss mr im too sexy for my shirt pants
8738630 the sopranos is over anyway but this is just for the sake of argument you understand
8738631 you have to show my next boyfriend how to do that im serious ill pay you to teach him that thing with the tongue
8738632 well i might have to charge if you want me to do a physical demonstration for him
8738633 no hes a really good kisser if hed kissed me like that when i was in high school we would have probably been too busy making out to make graduation which considering that my high school blew up during my graduation might have been a good thing but you still owe me five bucks
8738634 im sorry i dont have four thousand dollars to spend on your ability to slip me the tongue but if you dont mind im on the phone with gunn
8738635 gunn wants to know if youll show him your suave techniques
8738636 i cant even think about it now youre like my brother except not really because then that kiss would have been disgustingly wrong
8738637 that you were such a slut that youd even try to put the moves on me even though were utterly not suited for each other
8738638 it was a informational kiss there was no sluttage involved
8738639 informational kiss so what was the tongue part just a little extra bonus information
8738640 we couldnt bear to part with that much history and heritage
8738641 if you were to meet him you would think this person is unique this person is special
8738642 i can say without reservation that he is one of the most dedicated teachers i have ever had or known
8738643 he instills a love of learning in his students and most importantly a love of country
8738644 i guess because we were studying government he wanted to give us a title of respect
8738645 it was our way of recognizing the tremendous service he provided maine east high school
8738646 he just personalized his instruction particularly in government so that it engaged students in learning about the whole process
8738647 it didnt last very long ive been waiting for someone like him ever since
8738648 judging from the bush years and what thats actually brought which we all know i think people see that its exactly the same with gop nominee john mccain so i think its a fair assessment that the uk is for obama
8738649 its not just with the words and all his wonderful speeches but his action
8738650 i think hes going to roll up his sleeves and youll think hes like franklin delano roosevelt
8738651 the passcode lock feature is designed to prevent applications from being launched unless the correct passcode is entered an implementation issue in the handling of emergency calls allows users
8738652 ive heard nothing but good remarks from happy players and pleased coaches
8738653 the football players practiced first and coach said they had some sore legs because the field is new and a little bouncy they just have to get used to the turf
8738654 i suspect it certainly wont hurt but im probably the wrong guy to ask
8738655 the anticipation is actually that the facility lifts pride in the programs and with our non athletes as well it shows them we care about meeting the needs of all our students not just the academics or just the athletics
8738656 thats really an initiative our students want to see and are pushing
8738657 its important to everyone at the university that we reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible

8738660 oh yeah lets make it cute and fluffy theyll love it
8738661 whats truly significant about our work is that the extra hair cells were shown to be functional and they had a connection to the brain they actually work
8738662 they can transform energy into electrical signals that get passed into a hearing nerve and into the brain
8738663 will put us one big step closer to being able to regrow these hair cells and restoring natural hearing to people
8738664 its not something i can go to my clinic with and offer to patients right now but our discovery is keeping things on pace
8738665 the arcade station t2 is licensed to play xbox 360 video games in public and commercial spaces including arcade centres fec bars nightclubs and shopping malls
8738666 oh yeah this thing has had constant use up to the point that it broke and they gave up on it
8738667 attendance at games has gone up considerably and parking close in to the stadium has declined considerably
8738668 you cant really argue with the results that have come the last couple years
8738669 im fine parking a little bit farther away if these are the kinds of results well get

8738671 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8738672 this tragedy we are living in mexico city is going to spread to other states
8738673 this decision was in regard to mexico citys legislative assembly but in the end it establishes a precedent that can be applied to other local lawmaking bodies
8738674 its not up to the supreme court to legalize or criminalize abortion
8738675 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8738676 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8738677 it was hardly anyone regardless of their background young or old black or white who didnt have tears in their eyes when he said i have a dream
8738678 the thrill they had at the possibility of this event we wound up filling two trains
8738679 they were charmed by dr king and his willingness to sacrifice and put his life on the line
8738680 they were just insistent that they be a part of what they felt would be a momentous occasion
8738681 as someone put it we all stand on the shoulders of giants
8738682 what were seeing today is a successful continuation of a famous struggle which was dramatized by dr king
8738683 so those forms of selenium will differ in their capacity to change someones antioxidant status and capacity to prevent cancer
8738684 it just so happens that when you feed selenium to cows and they produce selenium enriched milk the selenium seems to be in a chemical form that is both highly absorbable into the body and also more effective in terms of preventing cancer
8738685 we are also taking biopsies from the lining of the bowel to make certain that the selenium is being delivered to the cells lining the bowel
8738686 if we can establish that is occurring then we will be more confident that selenium is going to regulate the cells lining the bowels in humans

8738701 there are no disciples of small government in the democratic party and barack obama fits right in his economic program is based on the assumption that the economy is to the president what a marionette is to a puppeteer requiring his direction and responding to his every wish anyone partial to free markets restrained government fiscal discipline and light taxation approaches a democratic nominees economic platform with trepidation expecting one fright after another obama does not disappoint
8738702 last year hammon a san antonio silver stars player who at 30 knew this would be her last chance to attain olympic glory realized she would not make the u s team while playing for cska moscow during the wnba off season she was offered russian citizenship so that she could play with the national team she also retained her american citizenship it was the only way for her to compete in beijing and politics being the last thing on her mind she took the opportunity hammon was vilified by many people in the sports world including anne donovan the u s womens basketball coach who said that she was not a patriotic person hammons decision to play with the russians contains a moral message individual sovereignty it tells us is a space that no collective force should violate invoking nationalist notions to condemn a womans pursuit of a dream that does no harm to anyone is to put national sovereignty above individual sovereignty the seed of totalitarian ideology
8738703 those who want the rich to pay more or give back not only confuse income with wealth but also fail to understand life cycle mobility and the effects of taxation and income redistribution programs on disposable income many people when they are young including the average graduate student would be classified as poor in terms of taxable income most people have a sharp rise in family or household income after they graduate from school and many of these enter the definition of upper income in their forties and fifties but after they retire their taxable income often drops to the point where they are considered middle income even though they may have more than a million dollars in net assets

8738708 this is about permission marketing people actually seeking you out and asking to be involved
8738709 during the past year the company has undertaken a significant realignment of its sales and marketing activities in order to focus on selling its own high margin business grade fixed broadband services these services contribute much higher average revenue per business customer approx 900 per customer per month versus its mobile wireless customers approx 53 per customer per month and they utilise bigairs own fixed wimax wireless networks covering the major metropolitan areas of sydney melbourne and brisbane
8738710 this realignment of sales efforts and other cost saving measures helped deliver a 49 percent reduction in sales and marketing expenses along with a five percent reduction in employee expenses and 37 percent reduction in general administration expenses compared to fy2007 resulting in an overall 28 reduction in operating expenses
8738711 due to strong customer growth and its network ownership which provides a fixed cost structure the margins generated in this division continue to increase reaching 78 percent versus 70 percent in fy2007 most of the network costs of service for fixed wireless broadband services are fixed and as this product line continues to expand we expect the cost of sales to grow at lower levels thus continuing to drive margin growth
8738712 if thats the case how come so many people have died and we dont know how many more will be showing symptoms
8738713 its affecting more and more people than you can possibly imagine
8738714 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major a major consumer issue
8738715 its nonsense they have to find out what caused this so that it can never happen again
8738716 if they dont find out how do i know that next month its not going to happen again or with some other products more care has to be put into how our food is prepared
8738717 because we knew we had made those products we had removed them from sale when the recall was initiated
8738718 we executed the recall we did it effectively efficiently and the products that are now being recalled were prepared and sold prior to the recall
8738719 if theres a problem with a product we pull the product off the floor and begin calling our customers and typically within 24 hours everyones been called
8738720 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
8738721 abortion and euthanasia have become preeminent threats to human life and dignity because they directly attack life itself the most fundamental good and the condition of all others abortion the deliberate killing of a human being before birth is never morally acceptable and must always be opposed
8738722 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
8738723 and senator st augustine said three months we dont know the point is it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8738724 grave moral evil the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8738725 he said every time i see you ill pull you over because i dont like you
8738726 i dont like white boy n loving punks like you
8738727 i was brave enough to go and confront his supervisors about this but im sure hes done it to other people
8738728 both academically and professionally dr hendrix has high qualifications with which to face this new challenge
8738729 we are very fortunate to have attracted an individual of dr hendrixs calibre and we feel that he brings to the position all the needed gifts and skills to help the anglican church of canada achieve a level of financial stability that will enable it to carry out the vital mission and ministry to which we are called in this new era
8738730 weve been so challenged at church house in terms of space issues and so many departments have had these same problems
8738731 this move is an opportunity to provide extra space for everybodys needs while still having the pension office very close and still part of the church house community
8738732 this in no way changes the relationship between church house and the pension office the director of pensions will continue to sit at and meet with other directors at the management team table meetings of some groups of the pension office may still be held in church house
8738733 its weird to come back and just see the water still here thats the hard part
8738734 its kinda disgusting you can see the mess its not livable
8738735 i do it because i feel a call that there must be change
8738736 i will definitely be rethinking my usage when i get back home
8738737 for including us you guys have given us hope hope for the church hope for the world
8738738 i want you to go with a mandate and with great joy to take a new path
8738739 keep your eyes open to make sure what you are doing on the path is indeed bringing great healing i see in you great hope hope that comes from your passion in your faith

8738774 talk to me when you are on your second pair of shoes
8738775 wait are you claiming you thought he was sane to begin with
8738776 rachel maddows promotion to prime time at msnbc more clearly draws the partisan lines among the cable networks writes brian stelter of the new york times msnbc on the left fox on the right and cnn claiming middle ground
8738777 maddow lives in manhattan and west cummington massachusetts with her partner artist and accountant susan mikula
8738778 so yeah the useless red mokes at msnbc might as well be rename themselves as affiliates under izvestia or tass or pravda
8738779 new york is a difficult place to be a manufacturer the energy cost is extremely high the tax burden is extremely high
8738780 perhaps the most important thing that state government can do is lower its sky high tax rates in order to lure businesses and their headquarters to the north country
8738781 we have a great amount of ability here locally and id like to harness that and to create jobs locally by having spin off businesses from our colleges and universities
8738782 the emphasis is always getting the highest paying job you can and for some reason they dont seem to make their way here maybe as unpopular as this may sound a minimum wage job is better than bringing no jobs
8738783 i know there is speculation about it but i am absolutely clear said triesman
8738784 i have said to the fa board that i do not want to be an executive chairman i have not sought to be that two and a half days a week was the aim the model
8738785 i am not going to go round doing any crude touting for votes that wont be the style of it
8738786 weve been beaten with so many sticks in the past but we arent going to complain about it shrugged joe cole the chelsea and england midfielder
8738787 we live a great life have a dream job we were as proud as anyone with our olympic team and we all want our national team to do really well were desperate to get that right and give people a side to really be proud of
8738788 it does hurt but weve got to take a large responsibility for our image we can do 99 great things and then make one little mistake and its that which is plastered all over the press
8738789 but we do need to protect our image because we dont want people to turn their backs on football
8738790 it has gone crazy the last 10 years and were looked at as stars but were still the same as everyone else
8738791 these kids are showing a lot of courage and its an inspiration for everyone said cole
8738792 theyve got a lot to fight against and you realise how lucky you are when you see these kids to me the superstars are the people who work for these charities and the kids themselves theyre the real champions it can be very emotional talking to them
8738793 all the kids want to know what this players like what that players like how much money youve got what car you drive whats it like playing for england
8738794 i love working with kids thats probably what id like to do when i finish my career pass on the knowledge ive gained ive got a lot of young nieces and nephews and i like spending time with them
8738795 i love chelsea im here ive got a contract here i wouldnt want to play anywhere else the club want me to stay im a chelsea boy
8738796 ive been here five years now and ive always played even after weve brought in players for 20 30 million world class players
8738797 the premier league is the bread and butter thats the mark of a club and who you are anything can happen in the champions league look how close we came last season we should have won it we were the better side in the final but the gods were not on our side
8738798 if youd asked me if id be happy with two wins out of two in the league and making it through to the champions league
8738799 we havent given our best performances yet and maybe we have had a lot of luck but one day your luck will run out and then we will have to perform really well to win
8738800 so as you can see as i pour water on the conventional concrete it just runs off the top
8738801 whats really neat about it is you dont see any of the water running over the top instead whats happening is its actually running through the concrete core and down through the bottom
8738802 it also cleans the water as the water moves through it
8738803 so things that we call suspended solids drop out as the water goes through the porous concrete and thats great for the environment
8738804 stormwater treatment is a very expensive practice but the hope is that if we can test different types of facilities we can see where we get the most bang for the buck the most pollutant removal for the smallest cost
8738805 if it turns out to be a success it could have many many other uses not only park and rides bike paths parking lots potentially road shoulders
8738806 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8738807 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8738808 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8738809 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8738810 i love the school and just want to represent it
8738811 yeah this is what youve got to do youve got to welcome the freshman in youve got to do it right youve got to have the right people to do it
8738812 its amazing and people want to give new students the same experience we got when we were here
8738813 were preparing and preparing and this day finally comes and its amazing its what weve been waiting for all year
8738814 a lot of people are helping out so its a nice welcome
8738815 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8738816 m s que una carta pastoral es un libro con toda la fundamentaci n de datos y lo importante es que es la intervenci n de una figura de iglesia con preocupaci n por la tica
8738817 what will it take to convince people the us isnt in recession
8738818 the us fed they want to raise rates but because of the fragility of the financial system they have to wait
8738819 at some point they have to raise rates to address inflationary problems
8738820 so those forms of selenium will differ in their capacity to change someones antioxidant status and capacity to prevent cancer
8738821 it just so happens that when you feed selenium to cows and they produce selenium enriched milk the selenium seems to be in a chemical form that is both highly absorbable into the body and also more effective in terms of preventing cancer
8738822 we are also taking biopsies from the lining of the bowel to make certain that the selenium is being delivered to the cells lining the bowel
8738823 if we can establish that is occurring then we will be more confident that selenium is going to regulate the cells lining the bowels in humans
8738824 ill talk to the prime minister about this later today with the concrete evidence that she will know that these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
8738825 the whole case is ridiculous hes definitely not a mobster
8738826 the whole case is ridiculous hes definitely not a mobster hes changed his life he tries to live like the average joe
8738827 i still have faith in the jury he can win this case and im confident he will
8738828 bill denson has made innumerable contributions to our success including his extraordinary service in the establishment and management of our foreign ventures in saudi arabia and mexico bill is a valued friend and counselor to all of his colleagues and we will miss his humor wit and sound business perspectives bob wason brings to his new position over 30 years of legal and business experience he is well equipped to lead the companys legal function
8738829 to see it in action and to hear the enthusiasm of the educators and students using it is something entirely different these videos bridge the gap between the printed brochure and witnessing a live smartmusic demonstration and will be immediately incorporated into all sales and marketing initiatives we believe that these videos will help further encourage teachers already using smartmusic to fully integrate smartmusic into their curriculum and will provide the final impetus for many prospective smartmusic customers to take the next step and make that initial purchase

8738832 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8738833 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8738834 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8738835 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8738836 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado

8738848 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8738849 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
8738850 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8738851 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8738852 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos
8738853 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios
8738854 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8738855 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8738856 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia

8738858 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8738859 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8738860 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
8738861 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche

8738863 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8738864 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8738865 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8738866 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8738867 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8738868 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen

8738876 we always seek to have full elimination of tariffs over time
8738877 that was our goal and substantially we achieved what we set out to achieve
8738878 we accept that different stages of development have to be taken into account in the offers
8738879 there will be progressively greater liberalisation in all markets australia and new zealand will move sooner than the other countries
8738880 its got to do with education and a lack of staffing and a lack of resources
8738881 we know if residents have more one on one attention we wouldnt need as many sedatives
8738882 its better to manage them through reducing the use of tea and coffee and giving hot milky drinks rather than giving sleeping tablets
8738883 its important to try other strategies rather than move straight on to medications that help people sleep and sedate them
8738884 when you talk about andrew symonds its like talking about bradman as a batsman or ponting as a batsman
8738885 hes in a place of his own hes that good an athlete like bolt
8738886 i think hes the best all around athlete for strength power and speed in cricket ive seen
8738887 ricky ponting is real good michael clarke is real good but none of those guys have the flat out brute athletic power and strength that symonds has
8738888 the guy paralyses you you cant teach guys that its natural
8738889 when i first got involved with the australian cricket team in 2003 we focused on our footwork throwing and quickness little strategies
8738890 we jumped the other countries they werent ready for it
8738891 but now theyve watched and everyones taken it on board and its great for cricket
8738892 increasingly clear that the ecbs next rate move will be down
8738893 wage dynamics cooling and inflation close to 2 0 per cent
8738894 suggest that a rate cut is not on the agenda before next year
8738895 our goal was to move into the last two games with a performance that was improving moving into a bigger and more important part of the season
8738896 were not going backwards with our preparation now were going into a schedule next week with a footy team thats on the improve
8738897 i think we needed last week more than the roosters and we played like it
8738898 we havent been playing the full 80 minutes and last week i think we finally played for the full 80
8738899 we havent beaten the tigers since about 2003 so theres no way well be underestimating them
8738900 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8738901 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8738902 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8738903 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year
8738904 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualised economic growth to recede to near 1 0 per cent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving
8738905 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast

8738926 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
8738927 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
8738928 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

8738976 im available from now to play every one day international for england including twenty20s
8738977 i was looking at playing one day cricket in india as a build up to the tests and didnt envisage coming back for this series but if stanford comes it comes i havent played twenty20 for england since we beat the aussies at the rose bowl in 2005
8738978 ive told the captain and coach what my feelings are but im going to keep them private i retired for cricketing reasons and ive come back from retirement for cricketing reasons
8738979 if i get picked for the stanford game there is not much i can do about it my one day return started as a favour to help the team out of an injury problem but ill be available to play one day cricket when squads are picked at the end of september
8738980 some people were surprised about south africa capitulating at trent bridge but once stuart broad had taken early wickets wed got the firepower to bowl anyone out for 80 odd
8738981 it is different to the pace bowling gang of 2005 this one has a bit more pace

8738990 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
8738991 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8738992 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8738993 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

8739004 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8739005 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8739006 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8739007 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8739008 this is a point i want to stress we are continuing to do research using human embryonic stem cells and ips cells we would not be where we are today without having worked with human embryonic stem cells these unique cells provide a window into human development and disease development that is needed if we are to make further progress in understanding and treating chronic diseases they remain the key to long term progress in regenerative medicine

8739017 repeated attempts to engage aladdin in constructive discussions about a transaction to combine part or all of aladdin with safenet have produced no results aladdin has rejected all of our proposals and has offered no basis for their conclusions and no strategic plan or valuation approach that would result in greater shareholder value than either of the two jasmine proposals it seems that aladdin simply intends to continue its current strategy that has already destroyed a great deal of shareholder value
8739018 jasmine is left with no choice but to call an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders the current board and management team do not appear to have a genuine interest in exploring jasmines proposals or other value maximizing avenues for its shareholders we are eager to continue discussions with our fellow shareholders regarding the state of the company and look forward to joining them in setting aladdin on a path to maximize shareholder value

8739038 as voters intended proposition 1b is paying for vital transportation projects that relieve traffic congestion reduce wait times at rail crossings and more importantly provide a shot in the arm to californias economy this is yet another reason the legislature needs to pass a budget sooner rather than later so this proposition 1b funding can get out the door and into the california economy
8739039 also the suspension of proposition 42 would not only delay projects funded from that source over the next three years but could slow down bond funded projects as well we need these infrastructure improvements now and must work together to protect proposition 42 funding for transportation despite our budget crisis doing so is important to our states economy as well as californias transportation future
8739040 what with the minnesota twins in the pennant race a stack of work so high you want to leap out of your skin and of course launching this challenge which by the way could put us out of business if mr

8739048 the 2nd quarter of 2008 continues to be very challenging and opportunistic for community banks
8739049 although we saw big write downs in goodwill from some of the larger community banks the majority of the smaller to mid size community banks remain rather stable and adequately capitalized we of course continue to closely monitor earnings and even more important asset quality
8739050 expect a long wait if they think that mainstream manufacturers
8739051 its easy to get caught up in talk of an electric car revolution

8739061 to commemorate the third anniversary of hurricane katrina on august 29 some of the pieces relate directly the hurricane and its disastrous aftermath others are targeted at the legacy of fred radtke
8739062 it seems too much of a coincidence that she died at the same time that we saw the spider
8739063 it seems like just yesterday when they were so sweet and little
8739064 this is a two dog pattern you can knit it with two dogs in your lap

8739067 when youre in a hurry they tend to make some bad decisions weve had a lot of near misses here during the state fair in which people did not want to get in line and wait
8739068 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8739069 this tragedy we are living in mexico city is going to spread to other states
8739070 this decision was in regard to mexico citys legislative assembly but in the end it establishes a precedent that can be applied to other local lawmaking bodies
8739071 its not up to the supreme court to legalize or criminalize abortion
8739072 they are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose
8739073 the justices decision is only going to spread more irresponsible behavior
8739074 this is a strong price move indicating amds commitment to the channel especially smaller system integrators
8739075 the market is soft right now but this has repositioned amd well the main battleground between amd and intel is the 135 180 band
8739076 hes drunk ive been following this guy for the last probably 30 miles
8739077 if you knew that russia was going to war with georgia why didnt you do anything about it
8739078 kbr has not seen the lawsuit so it is premature for us to comment at this time the safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains kbrs top priority the company in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior
8739079 first of all i would like to thank god for blessing me this entire season to two national championships and now this olympic silver medal i would also like to thank the entire faculty and staff at oral roberts university and especially the students who have been giving me support throughout the year which i truly appreciate also i would like to give great thanks to the track and field team and the coaching staff those guys have pulled me along this entire season finally id like to thank my friends family supporters and especially the entire bahamas and to you guys showing up today it really means a lot to me
8739080 its been a great run this year this is my 16th year and to end up having a guy like andretti to win the first national championship at oru is great hes put in a lot of hard work and i appreciate all he has done for the university and for the track program
8739081 it was great its something ive been dreaming about all my life when i first came to oru i told coach dial that i wanted to be an olympic champion everything just happened so fast and ive truly been blessed this entire year the olympics were great the meet organizers and volunteers made it a wonderful experience i plan on going back even if its just for a vacation
8739082 definitely now that my eligibility is up track and field is my profession my goal is to win an individual gold medal in the 400 at the 2012 olympics along with possibly a gold medal in the 4x4
8739083 just being there i think a lot of times people just tend to congratulate the person for winning medals but its so hard just to make it there and it was nice just to be able to interact with the athletes and supporters and volunteers
8739084 like i told coach dial i think that was more special for me than it was for the kids the reason why im doing track and field is because i believe god has blessed me with the talent so that i will be able to help influence others to just follow their dreams and i believe thats how well fully discover our purpose in life just seeing those kids faces and just knowing i was at least some type of motivation to them really touched me
8739085 honestly im still in disbelief right now after everything settles down and i start graduate school classes back tonight it will probably hit me that it actually happened i still cant believe the two national titles yet its truly an exciting feeling but im still in disbelief at this point coach dial has done a good job of helping me realize it though
8739086 honestly just besides being totally blessed we have a hunger to succeed life isnt easy back home compared to the u s we just want to succeed and we have the support from our government and country with this silver medal everyone in the bahamas be that still living there or anywhere in the world as far as their concerned feel like they just won the silver medal its just the overall support that the country gives its athletes is what keeps up going
8739087 it kept me spiritually focused i love the chapel services its just a time for me to focus on what i need to do as much as i love home and as slow as tulsa is compared to home this is the one place where i can be fully focused on everything i need to do and i just love oru for that now ive been given an opportunity to continue working with the oru track and field team and i would like to remain in tulsa and continue my professional training here my goal is to be just as much of a blessing to oru as oru has been to me this is going to come as a surprise and coach dial doesnt know it yet but now that im an alum i would like to bestow a financial blessing into the track team and into the lives of my teammates if coach dial accepts it and i hope he does i would like to give 3 000 to the track and field program im hoping to officially present the check at fridays chapel to just let them know that i truly appreciate what oru has done for me
8739088 a president cant vote present a president cant pick and choose which challenges he or she will face
8739089 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8739090 a man and a woman they asked me what happened surveyed the destroyed door and wrote on their pads of paper
8739091 i am going to clean the house i wish the house was cleaner
8739092 she is worried for her and doesnt want jamie lynn to make the same mistakes she with kevin federline she thinks shes way too young to marry casey especially if hes been cheating
8739093 he thinks it would be a good outlet for them preston and jayden are always singing and dancing around the house theyre total clowns even at their toddler playground mr gym
8739094 blew up when kevin asked her about letting the kids act
8739095 kevin feels its okay as long as they are watched over carefully and not pushed into it
8739096 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8739097 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8739098 chuck which returns at 8 p m sept 29 had a solid but abbreviated first season because of the writers strike its understood that nbc executives have been impressed with what theyve seen from the first six episodes of the shows second season order and decided to hand out an early full season pickup
8739099 it is our final offer and one we are proud of
8739100 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8739101 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is

8739106 we have walked out because they have refused to respond many mps requested a select committee to be formed but the minister home minister syed hamid albar refused
8739107 there is no point staying and participating in the debate
8739108 they walked out contrary to the rules because they dont want to accept defeat they know that they will be defeated
8739109 they walked out because they dont want it to appear like a failure for its leader who has said that he will be able to win over barisan nasional mps
8739110 the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation
8739111 there is no threat from anwar he has won in a by election and he becomes just another mp
8739112 from the march 8 elections till now we have done nothing but politicking but the defections havent happened they are waiting for it to happen but it hasnt happened good luck to them
8739113 i have a speech tonight that i wanted to practice out on you guys
8739114 see if it works in front of a friendly audience
8739115 i just wanted to come by because i havent had a chance to spend as much time with you as id like to let you know that i have not forgotten where i came from
8739116 is substantially written but as with all obama speeches hell be refining it and buffing it up and working on it im sure right until the very end
8739117 could structure a speech that was all about inspiration and broad themes
8739118 boring yeah thats why its taking so long because it was really not boring and we were trying to get it to be boring we were having a hard time with that and were hoping to get it boring in time
8739119 i dont think he was saying im purposely trying to tamp that down i think he has some things he wants to say that are very simple and direct about where we need to go as a country i think he thinks we can be direct and clear with people yet still not boring
8739120 this speech and this election are not about barack obama its about the american people its about this country its about the direction that we have to go to get us out of the ditch we are in and so hes going to spent the bulk of his time talking about the country and where we are today and where we need to go
8739121 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8739122 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8739123 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8739124 were glad to see were in the forecast path because they never get it right this far out
8739125 i say that slightly tongue in cheek but its true
8739126 anav no t cap credibilitat per la seva falta de transpar ncia i la incompet ncia manifestada
8739127 s molt preocupant el que est passant en les tres centrals nuclears de catalunya
8739128 els reiterats incidents en una de les zones m s nuclearitzades deuropa com s catalunya diuen molt clarament que estem suportant la gesti m s prec ria de la ind stria nuclear europea
8739129 porque hay mucha oferta de leche en galicia pero no hay demanda
8739130 tenemos que sacarla en el mes de septiembre a base de ofertas
8739131 el consumidor va a buscar el producto m s barato sea marca blanca o de oferta
8739132 todos los gallegos se pusieron locos y quer an cobrar el litro a 80 pesetas
8739133 as no pod a sostenerse la empresa porque se arruinar a y fue por lo que abrimos una ruta a portugal por la zona de zamora y desde ah tra amos diariamente 22 000 litros
8739134 mucha leche envasada en tetra brik y en botella de francia y tambi n de portugal
8739135 esto no es nuevo se lleva muchos a os as si entra ahora m s es porque llega a mejor precio que la que podemos estar vendiendo las industrias gallegas
8739136 that still looks grim in relation to the 70 percent levels typical of good times
8739137 in effect businesses are encouraged that better times lie ahead but remain deeply skeptical
8739138 over the moon with the offer and making arrangements as i write
8739139 she feels that this is a great seal of approval and knows that its an honor to be asked
8739140 while beta 1 was for developers we think that anyone who browses or works on the web will enjoy ie8 beta 2
8739141 we looked very hard at how people really browse the web
8739142 and tried a lot of different designs in front of many kinds of people not just technologists
8739143 for beta 2 weve worked with a lot of great partners to deliver a bunch of choices for users
8739144 theyre much faster and easier than the select copy new tab navigate paste repeat process in todays other browsers we hope that web sites and enthusiasts write more of them and give us feedback
8739145 crashes are more contained and affect fewer tabs than before
8739146 let the room overheat and replace all the computing hardware so what if youre down for a week
8739147 i bought a humidifier and a dehumidifier and put them together in a room to fight it out
8739148 transparency trust and control with respect to the sites they visit
8739149 if ie8 helps heighten awareness of this value exchange thats a step in the right direction
8739150 with internet access you could go to each vendor now as a separate interaction but with xohm the services are aggregated into a service package that correlates them due to the intelligence in the network for example plotting friend locations on a map identifying a restaurant or entertainment venue from local search and sharing plans to convene with the benefit of weather traffic or ticket purchase convenience
8739151 xohm subscribers arrange a subscription not a contract and open an account then go to a portal which contains the bundled wimax services applications a new wimax capable device is needed
8739152 we do not intend to curtail peoples freedom or the right to expres themselves but when they publish things that are libellous slanderous or defamatory it is natural for the commission to act
8739153 i will turn this into a big issue no doubt when it is known that the government has violated the charter the commission will die i will personally see to it
8739154 raja petra can be penalized if he missteps any of the malaysian laws
8739155 he knows that as he is now facing various police harassment over alleged seditions and civil suits from what he wrote about the police force and about the c4 explosives used to blow up the body murder of that mongolian woman just to quote a few 28 august 2008
8739156 nothing about the projects execution inspires the feeling that this was ever intended as anything more than a lark which would be fine if it were a good one
8739157 as it is audience teeth grinding sets in early and never lets up
8739158 pitt slices the ham very thick indeed but uniquely emerges as endearing in doing so
8739159 a beautifully produced mix of spy story us zeitgeist satire and relationship drama
8739160 burn is a smart urban screwball comedy about the perils of idiocy that uses its all star cast to dazzling and often hilarious effect
8739161 it would perhaps be more rewarding if we could like the characters as well as laugh at them
8739162 a minor piece of silliness with all the trappings of an a list studio movie
8739163 during times when economic conditions are volatile companies step up efforts to stress the importance of purchasing tickets in advance in order to use discount tickets in a negotiated travel program
8739164 our data shows that during the second quarter of 2008 89 percent of domestic tickets purchased were domestic discount coach fares this shows that more travelers purchased tickets in advance
8739165 no show that is currently there would be at any disadvantage
8739166 nobody is more disappointed or frustrated with sen lieberman than i am but we also have to look at the big picture
8739167 its far more important to keep control of the senate and focus on the democrats winning in november than paying attention to lieberman
8739168 there was a moment of rejoicing but at the same time it was also quickly followed by panic because there is nothing real clear or right to do today
8739169 i mean its obvious what record labels are doing is wrong but its not entirely clear what the right thing is to do
8739170 thats my grand ambition will it happen i dont know but its the most exciting thing on the horizon when i wake up in the mornings i mean think about it being able to integrate different forms of media to tell a story with music
8739171 it can wait sometimes you just have to take a breath
8739172 when i was getting out of high school and forming my identity musically all of it was really coming into the fold computers and drum machines it felt like you know im in the right place at the right time i liked the collision
8739173 so what does it matter now i was swimming in the hate now i crawl on the ground and everything i never liked about you is kinda seeping into me
8739174 i was ill equipped for social situations and found that having a few drinks made it easier then i found out i liked cocaine too and try living in new orleans where the bars dont close you come home in the morning and you always see some guy jogging thats the worst when youre stumbling in and the sun is coming up the sound of the birds in the morning
8739175 i was too young for woodstock i didnt really start going to concerts until my youngest son was old enough
8739176 i am almost 50 years old and i certainly dont want to be condemned i dont want to be looked upon as some kind of used up dude
8739177 we created this scene we deserve to be there we belong there
8739178 i think its pretty remarkable that i get to see people that are below 9 showing up at our festival and then people in their 50s showing up at our festival and they all seem to appreciate and enjoy the music across the board
8739179 i think our partners have always pretty much stood by the fact that were a family festival
8739180 obviously lollapalooza for the last four years hasnt been like lollapalooza of the early 90s
8739181 we are a company of 25 to 38 as well and we know what we were going to want to go do if we were going to pay the money
8739182 but we always keep in mind that its getting a little older and thats very interesting especially for lollapalooza
8739183 theres certainly some thought that goes into how do we make the event as broad as possible
8739184 our bosun is very excited about the build a boat competition and the two competing whidbey island crews have already made and tested two models
8739185 we have done some grooming on the hammerhead peninsula as allowed by permits
8739186 we have started clearing about two acres on robbins mountain as allowed by permit
8739187 what has happened as far as im concerned is he went over my survey line and took down a large number of very large trees
8739188 as i told the town office and the code enforcement officer i am the victim of trespassing and theft
8739189 the trees were marked and the pins are in the ground
8739190 the boundary line has been recorded by film and photographed and recognized by people i took on the ground whoever went across and cut the trees came down the hill went through the sisters wilderness trust and removed all the trees there then the trees on my property were cut down and taken out
8739191 there was noise but we decided the wedding was more important
8739192 the land has been raped and the people of cushing have lost what ive described as a cathedral in the woods
8739193 no were not going to cut trees in the protected areas
8739194 were very curious ourselves honestly to see what effect palacios death will have on the group
8739195 although they may not have the quote unquote star quality that andy had we know they bring the same authenticity that the audience comes here to engage with
8739196 you could feel among the women a renewed level of dedication and a sense of urgency after his death
8739197 we all felt that we had to do everything possible so that this door that andy opened for us would not close on us again
8739198 traditionally the men are fishermen and the women are in charge of cultivating the fields as well as raising the children they are also the ones responsible for transmitting many aspects of the culture they have a very distinct timbre to their voices and they bring a whole different sensibility to the music
8739199 the stage of preservation is past and its now important to move the music into the future
8739200 thats the only way young people will identify with it and when the youth stop relating to their own music because they find it boring or old fashioned thats when the music will die
8739201 on this tour the important thing is to show that theres so much talent in this community
8739202 this project is not summed up in one person or one artist we want the world to be aware of what we have to offer
8739203 a different political standpoint im not a big war believer
8739204 he knows how good he is as a knife fighter
8739205 even if she can move on easily thats not as easy for everybody else
8739206 both parties try to control every minute of the convention as if it were a television show because it is a television show
8739207 you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating i never liked being that skinny
8739208 is a thumbs down for the surefire hall of fame quarterback
8739209 people kept asking what kind of music theyd hear on this next album whether it was going to be r amp b pop country or rock and i seemed to keep saying the same thing
8739210 its going to be alittle bit of everything i guess
8739211 someone who gets what you do and gets that youre not going to be around a lot
8739212 it is an enormous victory for the consumers in this case
8739213 its an extremely important case not only for consumers in washington but throughout the country
8739214 a growing number of companies have been using these to limit the ability of their customers to sue them if they break the law
8739215 is substantively unconscionable and therefore unenforceable to the extent that it purports to waive the right to class actions require confidentiality shorten the washington consumer protection act statute of limitations and limit availability of attorney fees
8739216 courts will not be easily deceived by attempts to unilaterally strip away consumer protections and remedies by efforts to cloak the waiver of important rights under an arbitration clause

8739220 the growth data are even better than many expected and again counter beliefs the economy was in recession in the first half of the year
8739221 t he momentum going into the third quarter is clearly greater and could result in a significant upward revision to 2008 real growth estimates
8739222 w e think it is too soon to turn optimistic as the economy faces important challenges in the months ahead most important weak consumer fundamentals will likely begin to assert themselves in the second half of the year as the stimulus from the income tax rebates begins to fade
8739223 the income side of the economy has expanded by only 0 3 over the last year in real terms while expenditure based real gdp is up 2 2 moreover the income estimate of gdp fell in both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year looking much more like a classic recession that we think began in december 2007
8739224 sony has realized that any consumer who needs aspirin desires to rent a movie or enjoys coffee every morning also walks into the popular store of their choice wishing that they could buy a pre paid card for the playstation network store
8739225 i looked at that and said i can do that
8739226 it was that show that made it cool for me
8739227 she had been on there just doing different blogs and rotated cakes we made as her picture id and we started to get a lot of e mail responses from mothers through that site
8739228 through the years im pretty confident to say theres only a handful of people in the area places that you can get a three dimensional sculpted cake like that
8739229 we didnt cut it for like two hours because we were looking at it
8739230 it was so moist and i thought my mom made it for me
8739231 its made our life have a more solid foundation together
8739232 it keeps us on our toes and it reopened our communications together
8739233 the opposition parties are screaming that were cutting funding nothing could be further from the truth it doesnt take a rocket scientist to add up the numbers and see theres 113 million new dollars going into the system
8739234 it hit so fast and so furious and so cruel i mean one minute you have her and the next you dont
8739235 somewhere along the line something happened we cant even get to the grief stage yet because we dont even know what to think where to begin
8739236 we have an unwavering commitment to keep our food safe and we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8739237 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world
8739238 this is a terrible tragedy and the system failed we will fix it
8739239 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but it can always be better thats why we are investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and hiring 200 more inspectors
8739240 those corpses are nice but a bit large to stick in the toilet

8739244 our goal was to move into the last two games with a performance that was improving moving into a bigger and more important part of the season
8739245 were not going backwards with our preparation now were going into a schedule next week with a footy team thats on the improve
8739246 i think we needed last week more than the roosters and we played like it
8739247 we havent been playing the full 80 minutes and last week i think we finally played for the full 80
8739248 we havent beaten the tigers since about 2003 so theres no way well be underestimating them
8739249 tigers coach tim sheens is a smart man and whoever he ends up putting in there will do a job
8739250 when you talk about andrew symonds its like talking about bradman as a batsman or ponting as a batsman
8739251 hes in a place of his own hes that good an athlete like bolt
8739252 i think hes the best all around athlete for strength power and speed in cricket ive seen
8739253 ricky ponting is real good michael clarke is real good but none of those guys have the flat out brute athletic power and strength that symonds has
8739254 the guy paralyses you you cant teach guys that its natural
8739255 when i first got involved with the australian cricket team in 2003 we focused on our footwork throwing and quickness little strategies
8739256 we jumped the other countries they werent ready for it
8739257 but now theyve watched and everyones taken it on board and its great for cricket
8739258 everyone is catching up but they still have to execute which is what australia does best

8739261 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8739262 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8739263 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8739264 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies
8739265 why must investors spend tens of thousands of dollars to receive the list
8739266 we need one starter to replace livan hernandez because hes bad and one to replace jorge de la rosa because he used to be bad
8739267 im glad to hear that over 70 protest issues have been solved through consultation and dialogue

8739269 because you didnt listen to me when i told you we needed to get off at steiner
8739270 thats why you called me you want to know how to cook hot dogs
8739271 all right you put a couple of cups of water in the bottom of the steamer put the hot dogs in the top part and cover it cook them about 7 10 minutes okay
8739272 shes been calling for the last fifteen minutes because there must be six or seven calls on here i just didnt hear the phone going off
8739273 o m g oldest yes the hotdogs can be frozen when you put them in the steamer im trying to enjoy a romantic sailboat cruise with your mother now do you have any other questions
8739274 hussey mayfield public library is working our way toward a full open source library in all aspects and this is one more step on that direction
8739275 evergreen is built with the right tools has strong scalability and can be used in consortial settings its software created by libraries for libraries
8739276 evergreen proves its mettle in these multi site settings everyone at hussey mayfield has been great to work with open source software is obviously a viable solution and as more libraries come on board and share their local knowledge evergreen becomes more powerful and adds even better features
8739277 so those forms of selenium will differ in their capacity to change someones antioxidant status and capacity to prevent cancer
8739278 it just so happens that when you feed selenium to cows and they produce selenium enriched milk the selenium seems to be in a chemical form that is both highly absorbable into the body and also more effective in terms of preventing cancer
8739279 we are also taking biopsies from the lining of the bowel to make certain that the selenium is being delivered to the cells lining the bowel
8739280 if we can establish that is occurring then we will be more confident that selenium is going to regulate the cells lining the bowels in humans
8739281 with the approach we are taking to prevention you probably only need to achieve a slight subtle effect with selenium for a benefit to become evident
8739282 its got to do with education and a lack of staffing and a lack of resources
8739283 we know if residents have more one on one attention we wouldnt need as many sedatives
8739284 its better to manage them through reducing the use of tea and coffee and giving hot milky drinks rather than giving sleeping tablets
8739285 its important to try other strategies rather than move straight on to medications that help people sleep and sedate them
8739286 what will it take to convince people the us isnt in recession
8739287 the us fed they want to raise rates but because of the fragility of the financial system they have to wait
8739288 at some point they have to raise rates to address inflationary problems
8739289 we always seek to have full elimination of tariffs over time
8739290 that was our goal and substantially we achieved what we set out to achieve
8739291 we accept that different stages of development have to be taken into account in the offers
8739292 there will be progressively greater liberalisation in all markets australia and new zealand will move sooner than the other countries
8739293 ill talk to the prime minister about this later today with the concrete evidence that she will know that these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
8739294 increasingly clear that the ecbs next rate move will be down
8739295 wage dynamics cooling and inflation close to 2 0 per cent
8739296 suggest that a rate cut is not on the agenda before next year
8739297 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8739298 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8739299 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8739300 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year
8739301 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualised economic growth to recede to near 1 0 per cent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving
8739302 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast
8739303 patent expiries are challenging times however following the recent approval of cimzia for crohns disease in the u s and the positive opinions for neupro for rls and vimpat for epilepsy in europe the time is now to take action to shape ucb for the future and become a specialist company focused on successfully delivering our new medicines to patients earlier this month we announced the shape project which aims to re allocate eur 300 million within the next three years towards increased investments into ucbs core cns and immunology business areas while also seeking to improve ucbs competitiveness
8739304 we will help our employees to go through the changes ahead of us our priority will be to look for solutions that lead to a new future we aim to achieve this through an open and constructive dialogue with our social partners around the globe
8739305 the actions outlined today position us to focus on the strategic alternatives process that we initiated several months ago as well as preserve our cash resources
8739306 the process we are conducting involves a number of alternatives including merger or acquisition of the company together with the possible sale of our c difficile and dna replication inhibition programs while the process is ongoing we are encouraged by our progress to date
8739307 gsk is looking forward to working with valeant to provide important medicines like retigabine to the medical community and to the patients we serve
8739308 there is a significant need for novel anti epileptic drugs as almost one third of patients with epilepsy continue to experience seizures despite treatment with currently available medications we believe that retigabine could potentially play a significant role in improving the management of epilepsy and is a welcome addition to gsks portfolio
8739309 we were pleased with the significant interest shown in retigabine and we have selected gsk as a collaborator because we believe they are ideally suited and strongly committed to the continued development of this important compound
8739310 gsks development expertise and strong commercial infrastructure will be critical to maximising the worldwide potential of retigabine we believe this collaboration will strengthen our ability to bring this medicine to patients suffering from epilepsy and a variety of other conditions

8739317 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them

8739320 the findings in this report will aid public health and emergency preparedness efforts and may help reduce the mortality burden in future natural disasters
8739321 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8739322 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8739323 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8739324 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8739325 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8739513 rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven
8739514 ye are the salt of the earth ye are the light of the world
8739515 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily i say unto you heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven for i say unto you except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven
8739516 thou shalt not kill thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness
8739517 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy
8739518 ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire
8739519 but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart
8739520 what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
8739521 resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also
8739522 if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more witnesses and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican
8739523 love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust
8739524 be ye therefore perfect even as father which is in heaven is perfect
8739525 take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you have their reward but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thine alms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him
8739526 take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven
8739527 for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them

8739529 our father which art in heaven hallowed by thy name thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one
8739530 thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
8739531 and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
8739532 and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one
8739533 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
8739534 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness
8739535 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
8739536 therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
8739537 judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye
8739538 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
8739539 or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye

8739543 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone or if he a fish will he give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him
8739544 everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
8739545 if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him
8739546 enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it
8739547 therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets
8739548 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
8739549 every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up
8739550 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit

8739552 i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
8739553 fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
8739554 and i will give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
8739555 therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes
8739556 as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour
8739557 as the whirlwind passeth so is the wicked no more but the righteous is an everlasting foundation
8739558 there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet

8739647 your notes for march 8 probably do not indicate that the late fee was incurred as a result of daylight savings time in my opinion another instance of where zipcars computer system could use some finessing since there certainly must have been many complaints for overcharging on that day

8739654 husband and wife can have personal fellowship by engaging in common service for others by sharing some mutual responsibility for other people by cultivating common friendships or by developing some common interests
8739655 the purpose of the marriage has been sought among other things in the service thereby rendered to the state or nation or in the happiness thereby provided or in the procreation and rearing of children important as these purposes are they represent only certain aspects of marriage never indicate its ulimate goal
8739656 marriage is an alliance of two persons who notwithstanding their physical nature and their sexuality are members of the body of christ and who therefore share the mystery of christs union with the church
8739657 a word needs to be said here about the wedding ceremony as a means of grace by this he does not mean marriage as a sacrament or an infusion of grace the benediction pronounced by the pastor is no mere formality or simply a nice looking appendage to the civil ceremony as many a young people seems to think in the church ceremony the spouses publicly affirm their membership before the congregation and thus they confess that they regard their union an expression of their christian lives and of their desire to live them according to the biblical understanding the churchs prayer and benediction form the congregations response to the couples declaration the wedding ceremony therefore is not a mere public proclamation of the divine blessing promised to a christian couple but also a valid offer of the great and real blessings that by gods will the church has to share with spouses the minister communicates to them the portion they have in all those gifts of the holy spirit which they need in order to make theirs a christian marriage
8739658 we believe the state acts in its own best interest by furterhing the christian evaluations of marriage and the church must insist upon its right publicly to proclaim its interpretation however the strongest defense against un christian concepts of sex is to be found in christian marriage the light of faith shine to all in the house by way of conduct christians demonstrate the superiority of their ideal of marriage where it is lacking all prohibitions against adverse propaganda are valueless because the christian ideal seems to be of doubtful value to its own advocates
8739659 it was the kind of contribution i wanted to make from the very beginning
8739660 everywhere i looked there was something needing to be done they needed help
8739661 another plus was that the materials were to the local standards
8739662 i stopped in to the headquarters for the philippine seabees and met with their rear admiral and asked if he could spare five seabees he gave us fifteen additionally he put us in contact with the philippine army corps of engineers who provided us with an additional 25 enlisted and officer engineering personnel so we went from having 20 seabees to having a work crew of over 50

8739763 this means the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechano sensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper pre flight pose

8739783 ive noticed a change in general bus drivers are happier
8739784 its saving the bus driver mucking around with tickets other than that its annoying to hold onto a card to get on and off the bus
8739785 its okay youve got to remember to tag off heaps of people forget to tag off because theyre used to the 10 trip passes
8739786 i dont think its going to be effective initially but itll pick up speed and eventually will be
8739787 i think itll be effective but ive read about people being able to crack the software and get free rides so maybe not

8739801 isnt it far fetched district authorities blaming a particular outfit within minutes of arriving at a crime scene
8739802 in december 2007 the area witnesses some of the bloodiest violence orissa has even seen after the swami was attacked by christians the state might have wanted to avert a repeat of the communal clashes and therefore could have pinned the blame on the maoists
8739803 elections are coming in a matter of months the state has failed miserably in tackling the maoist insurgency a government that has been terrorised by the maoists may in turn be trying to terrorise the people in the name of the maoists
8739804 the central committee authorises the killings and the outfit issues statements owning up to the murders they commit so many days after the murder there has been no statement from the maoists
8739805 the five attackers who the locals caught and handed over to the police are not maoists
8739806 moreover i see no reason why the maoists will spare the policemen on duty
8739807 they see themselves as revolutionaries they never care about whether they are seen or not in fact i would say they would very much want to be seen
8739808 chances are very less he was working for the welfare of the tribal people and against forced conversions in the region there is nothing that suggests the maoists would see him as a class enemy
8739809 one day last year i was talking to the swami on phone and that time there was a lot of concern about his security so he said dont you people worry the maoists are not a threat to me in fact some of them are here with me
8739810 the best way this could be phrased is we do not rule out the involvement of the maoists
8739811 after the december 2007 clashes even the hindu outfits agreed that the maoists are working in tandem with militant christian outfits
8739812 a lot of maoists were converts to christianity and were involved in the december violence but this attack does not look like their work
8739813 there is a high possibility that this is the handiwork of militant christian outfits how they got such sophisticated weapons is something for the government to figure out
8739814 the governments responsibility to bring those responsible to book increases when you take into account the fact that the swami received an anonymous threat only a week before he was killed the local sp did not even register a case after the swami lodged a formal complaint they have to answer a lot of questions or this issue will snowball into a bigger issue than the december violence
8739815 i am here nothing will happen go plough mother earth

8739817 several sc christians are falsely identifying themselves as hindu scs and getting job reservation benefits they are preventing hindu scs from getting jobs
8739818 the thruway has already jacked up its tolls we want to make sure that motorists arent being shaken down at the pump too there are limits to how much stations on the thruway can charge our audit will look at whether or not those limits are being adhered to anyone who drives the thruway knows gas prices are higher and motorists are forced to pay those prices there arent a lot of options once you get on the thruway but just because those stations have a captive market doesnt give them license to gouge at the gas pump gas prices are high enough already
8739819 in buffalo we are paying 3 97 right now a gallon and here there at 3 85 so its a bonus for me now traveling down the thruway i was actually surprised that they are cheaper on the thruway
8739820 you kind of have to think about where youre going to stop for gas instead of waiting till its almost empty
8739821 i fill up in albany because i can drive all the way to buffalo with one tank of gas its like 40 cents more in buffalo than in albany
8739822 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected

8739826 barack obama was determined to have a union made suit on his back when he addresses the country tonight
8739827 our members and working people all across the country will put him on our backs and carry him to the white house
8739828 weve been with barack obama since he ran for the u s senate and we know he will fight for good wages affordable healthcare and a secure retirement for workers
8739829 his decision to wear a union made suit reflects his commitment to support american manufacturing jobs
8739830 the sidewalk sale and car show will provide economic benefits to all of our downtown merchants
8739831 the ongoing collapse of the anglican communion and the concurrent inability of conservative anglicans outside that body to get their act together suggest that these groups may share a fatal flaw anglicanism may arguably be seen as a 450 year experiment to determine whether a separated part of the church can remain fully catholic keeping its apostolic ministry and grounding its teaching and practice in holy scripture and the sacraments but replacing the authority structures of the main body of the church with a sort of democracy in which no single leader has complete authority and in which clergy and laity gathered together in synods and conventions take the place of church councils a strong case can be made for the premise that the experiment is concluded and it has failed
8739832 a strong case can be made for the premise that the experiment called the orthodox church is concluded and it has failed
8739833 a sort of democracy in which no single leader has complete authority
8739834 also the church of rome hath erred not only in their living and manner of ceremonies but also in matters of faith

8739837 this financial commitment will go a long way toward helping an already solid foundation in the reynolds center

8739843 hold on to your bloomers i am up four points on my opponent im not trying to make a point or move the ball down the field but to win
8739844 but this has been the most rapid change to prejudice ever seen we are on the verge of one of the great moral victories in human history
8739845 the values of freedom and equal opportunity which have given him his historic chance will drive him as president to give all americans regardless of race religion gender sexual orientation or disability their chance to build a decent life and to show our humanity as well as our strength to the world
8739846 in all nations that have discussed abortion in constitutional courts there is a before and an afterwards
8739847 in mexico the afterwards is now beginning the legal and social impact of this decision are undeniable
8739848 the measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with but whether its the same problem you had last year
8739849 you come in with ideas and you figure out if they can convert into priorities
8739850 my perception is that this and this are important to us but are they how does it relate to whats going on
8739851 an unconventional set of skills and experiences to the job
8739852 i have very extensive relationships in the sports industry a pretty deep network of people in broadcast professional sports collegiate sports and olympic sports that i can call on
8739853 whether its building a major athletic facility bidding on a super bowl working with the ncaa and the nba to come together over a new youth basketball business all of those things involve taking parties who arent necessarily natural partners or dont have an existing affinity and trying to create some commonality and a shared vision
8739854 i want every coach to have clearly in mind what their path to a national championship is
8739855 now we may conclude for facility reasons or for scheduling reasons or other things it might not be practical for that squad to get there but thats the starting point of the evaluation
8739856 we do encourage them to sign up for the military
8739857 we can use the training to secure the resistance to our government
8739858 our military doesnt agree with our political beliefs they are not supposed to be in the military but theyre there in ever greater numbers
8739859 w e witnessed with timothy mcveigh that todays racist extremist may become tomorrows domestic terrorist
8739860 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8739861 police will allege the woman was greeted by a 74 year old man who entered the home and then assaulted the woman with a weapon before proceeding to the bathroom and assaulting the wheelchair bound man
8739862 as a result of the incident the man and woman both sustained multiple stab wounds to their backs heads and chests
8739863 this was a surprisingly strong report that should end the discussion about a recession at least for now
8739864 john mccain is my friend but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country for example john thinks that during the bush years weve made great progress economically i think its abysmal
8739865 and in the senate john sided with president bush 95 percent of the time give me a break when john mccain proposes 200 billion in new tax breaks for corporate america 1 billion alone for just eight of the largest companies but no relief for 100 million american families thats not change thats more of the same
8739866 folks remember when the world used to trust us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as our president theyll look to us again theyll trust us again and well be able to lead again

8739874 police have been told that the man allegedly grabbed the girl and indecently assaulted her
8739875 the girl freed herself from the mans grasp and alerted police
8739876 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8739877 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8739878 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it just sounds not rational
8739879 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8739880 doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8739881 we are in the process of reevaluating our relationship with russia

8739883 the humanitarian needs of conflict victims and those displaced by recent violence in georgia
8739884 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8739885 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before august 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area
8739886 our objective was to maintain peace there and contain the situation and nothing else

8739904 that seems to be the reality of it but its not the game plan
8739905 were disappointed in the way we played earlier now theres nowhere else to look and somehow weve found a way to respond to the challenge i dont know whether to laugh or cry
8739906 we want to make the other team sweat a little bit
8739907 the committee was very disappointed in ms rileys actions and felt that the fighting situation was in violation of the principles of fair play and sportsmanship that are so important in our championship

8739929 sono stato in vacanza in africa e non mi sono trovato bene
8739930 there were intense bright lights shining into my window blinding me suddenly one of those lights surrounded me and i was lifted into the air thats when i passed out
8739931 they were some kind of aliens poking and prodding me with instruments stranger than the ones i use
8739932 my professional training took over each tooth faced in a different direction despite the circumstances all i could think about was fixing those teeth
8739933 they started to examine their teeth in a mirror apparently they gave little thought to oral aesthetics i showed them my teeth as an example of how much better they could look
8739934 they chattered among themselves when they were finished one of them agreed to allow me to work on his teeth aliens who i discovered were called the briitosh were able to synthesize the materials and tools i needed
8739935 ill have to admit i was intimidated briitosh teeth are three times larger than human teeth and made out of some type of metal adjusting their position would be difficult but the principles were the same as on earth it took 50 gauge wire to realign them but i was successful
8739936 i would be quite successful as the only orthodontist on their planet but i couldnt leave my friends and family behind besides they were going to pay me in coins made of jellyfish

8739982 we were trying to understand why traumatic brain injury increases the risk of alzheimers disease
8739983 this study is novel in part due to the sheer size and scope of the study compared to earlier works
8739984 sleep problems in older adults should be addressed by treating underlying conditions rather than viewed as simply a consequence of aging

8739989 we have presidential elections as a substitute for serious democratic politics
8739990 obama and mccain agree on the global war on terror
8739991 my own preference would be for an election in which we had one candidate making the case for the global war on terror that would be mccain but we would have an opponent who would make the case that the concept of global war as the response to violent islamic radicalism is flawed we ought not be in the business of invading and occupying other countries thats not going to address the threat it is on the other hand going to bankrupt the country and break the military
8739992 tutor muslims in matters related to freedom and the proper relationship between politics and religion
8739993 really it was bill clinton who more than anybody else made armed intervention a routine aspect of american political life yes george hebert walker bush started the ball rolling with the overthrow of noriega in panama followed by desert storm followed by the intervention in somalia but clinton picked up the baton in somalia clinton went into haiti clinton went into bosnia clinton went into kosovo clinton pummeled afghanistan iraq and sudan with bombs and missiles so theres blame to be shared by both parties
8739994 and bush overthrew saddam hussein because he wanted to liberated the iraqi people
8739995 when the us uses force it advertises its purposes in idealistic terms but the us does not use force primarily for the purpose of advancing democratic values or freeing the oppressed the us like every other power in history uses its power in order to satisfy concrete interests
8739996 but we have increasingly become a culture that emphasizes consumption limitless consumption regardless of whether we have the money to pay the bills while others notably china and japan have become the source of the goods we consume theres something fundamentally out of whack here this disparity between what we produce and what we consume is simply not sustainable
8739997 his famous malaise speech in 1979 was enormously prescient in warning about the consequences of ever increasing debt and dependency
8739998 but that speech was greeted with howls of derision ronald reagan said we could have anything we wanted there were no limits then we the people rejected carters warning and embraced reagans promise of never ending abundance that was a fateful choice
8739999 there are no limits to what is possible in america
