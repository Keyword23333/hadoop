510015 the fact that were reduced to trying to send messages to the pakistanis by putting stories in newspapers tells you we dont have any good options
510016 it also suggests that the high level face to face contacts havent worked so far the trouble is these kinds of public threats are likely to backfire
510017 one thing we never understood is that india has always been the major threat for pakistan
510018 pakistan over the last several years has increasingly come to believe that it is being encircled by india and a u s india afghan axis
510019 we have created a set of perverse incentives for the pakistanis to continue their support for the taliban
510020 pakistan does not view the united states as a long term player in the region and certainly doesnt view pakistans strategic interests as congruent with ours and that divergence is getting larger not smaller
510021 substantial progress in closing down the training camps evicting foreign fighters and preventing the taliban from using pakistan as a staging area for attacks in afghanistan

510023 i have had my invitation to lifes festival and my life has been blessed my eyes have seen and my ears have heard it was my part to play upon my instrument and i have done all i could now i ask has the time come at last when i may go in and see thy face and offer thee my salutations
510024 the butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light the light is shattered into gold on every cloud my darling and it scatters gems into profusion mirth spreads from leaf to leaf my darling and gladness without measure
510025 it was a good practice good tempo i think we got a lot done the players now have about a day and a half off well deserved they have been going eight straight days and they needed a little break but i was glad with the way it ended
510026 what impressed you the most not missing or the 68 yarder i kind of liked the last one to be honest with you we put all the pressure on him the game winning field goal with three seconds left in the two minute drill hes been doing that pretty consistently since hes been here so it didnt really surprise anybody but its nice to see him do that in his first live two minute drill
510027 you just watch him kick off when you watch a guy kick off and he kicks it sometimes 10 yards out of the end zone his leg strength is probably up to 75 78 yards that would have been good at 73 or 74 yards right there he doesnt kick any harder he has the same swing consistently hopefully he can make the ones inside the 45 every once in a while depending on what the situation is a guy gets a chance to attempt one of those but usually its at the end of a half or the end of a game
510028 he had enough pressure i thought it was the first day he had everybody looking at him both in our field goal drills and the two minute drill he stepped up and did a fine job
510029 his wife is having a baby we sent him home to take care of that there are no guarantees there either im not sure if they had it all the way or not but she went to the hospital and hopefully everything is fine
510030 i havent talked to gary ill see him in a few hours when were out there in canton ohio im looking forward to his day his speech and president and chief executive officer pat bowlens introduction of gary i talked about what a great asset he was to this organization a great person a great football player and im looking forward to him getting his due what a great career
510031 i didnt even know we were going to go back that far today it wasnt in the script we went back to 68 yards i just tried to keep it straight and it went through
510032 it felt good to just show the team that i can do it and give them some confidence in me so in the game when i do have a chance to have a game winner they expect me to make it and they are not thinking flip a coin i maybe got a little bit more confidence out of the team and a little more confidence in myself
510033 it helped me out a lot to see jason elam hit the game winner against minnesota
510034 i still have to do it in the game there will still be some questions but hopefully i get the opportunity and do well in the game
510035 i am going to be in the cold tub for awhile today camp is going well and i think i have had a couple misses throughout camp i feel pretty good and i have been hitting the ball well special teams coach scott obrien is doing a lot for me as far as technique goes and i am feeling confident when i am going out there for a field goal
510036 i dont know who it is going to be right now but it is sam paulescu and brett kern competing and they are both doing a really good job holding they have both done a really good job holding and i have seen the ball well with both so either way it will be fine with me
510037 i dont know i wasnt really paying attention i just go out and hit it and hopefully it goes straight im sure there were a couple people that were like what is going on but once i hit it some were shocked and some expected it because they have seen me kick before it just felt good to do it
510038 i would especially out here because the ball travels well unless there is wind in my face
510039 owners who think their pugs are humans are completely delusional
510040 but then so are the ones who think their pugs are dogs
510041 they have fallen out of supermans capsule on the way to planet krypton where bad radio beams have scrambled the message of what dogs are supposed to be like
510042 their eyes hang out of their heads and have to be frequently stitched back in and they can barely breathe and have you observed a pug walk they do it in segments as for loyalty or affection it can only be roused if they think food is coming their way pugs have no inner goodness at all
510043 of course i adore him but very warily as you would do with something that is not of this planet it is all part of a plan from krypton archie is a ticking time bomb any moment now he will explode and we will all turn into pugs

510401 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
510402 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
510403 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see

510409 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
510410 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
510411 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
510412 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
510413 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
510414 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
510415 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
510416 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

510517 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history

510523 it was easy to pick up for me and i could visualize what i was supposed to do on a lot of plays when you can do that early on in an offense you can kind of take control of it and gain confidence in it

510537 the club felt that once this had been pointed out and you had this gentleman there who was obviously close to young men massaging young men it ran an unnecessary risk and thats why it decided it was best that he not perform those duties again
510538 its the same if you have a pedophile there as a masseur right and you might say the pedophile would do no damage but once it was pointed out to you you have a duty of care to those underage children not to put them in a situation of risk
510539 my reference to pedophilia was to make the point of what has been occurring in various churches this has heightened public opinion and led to many organisations trying to put in place programs or actions to minimise risk to individuals within organisations or clubs

510561 the europeans are considerably farther ahead when it comes to ecad and theyre moving quickly we like how eplan has been architected to a database its very conducive to what we do
510562 ape is a configurator that runs in front of ecad taking advantage of ecads abilities to set up queries and quickly generate a set of intelligent documents
510563 error reduction features such as automatic wire connection automatic wire numbering and automatic cross referencing were available in the first versions of eplan created in 1984 to run on early x86 dos computers
510564 therefore ecad vendors need to take the graphical object from the component manufacturers and link it to a record in the database such as connection points and give it a device tag
510565 not only makes searching individual manufacturer catalogues unnecessary it also eliminates the need to type in part numbers or create ones own macros
510566 the time allocated to these fishing expeditions for the right components is instead turned into productive work time

510596 rapat konsultasi digelar untuk menindaklanjuti putusan mahkamah konstitusi yang mengabulkan judicial review uu 32 2004
510597 yang lainnya seperti persyaratan dan lain lain biarkan berkembang dalam pembahasan pembahasan yang terpenting sesegera mungkin pemerintah dan dpr melaksanakan putusan mk
510598 pasal 6a ayat 1 dan 2 dalam uud menjelaskan pasangan calon presiden diusulkan parpol atau gabungan parpol tidak sama sekali menyebutkan independen
510599 kalau bupati dan gubernur bisa maka memungkinkan pilpres bisa diikuti calon independen
510600 amandemen sebagai payung hukum calon independen harus atas persetujuan dpr
510601 presiden dan dpr sepakat dengan putusan mk saja kita sudah syukur alhamdulillah
510602 sebenarnya ada beberapa opsi termasuk perppu dan opsi lain kpu bisa mengatur untuk mengisi kekosongan uu tersebut jadi langkah yang diambil presiden ini paling tidak berisiko
510603 insya allah awal 2008 revisi selesai sesuai dengan komitmen pemerintah dan dpr rakyat sudah dengar janji tersebut karena itu harus ada langkah konkret
510604 presiden menjelaskan putusan mahkamah konstitusi diambil berdasar pada kewenangan mahkamah pemerintah dan dpr akan mengambil langkah sesegera mungkin untuk membuat aturan teknis
510605 bulan januari 2008 mudah mudahan bisa diterapkan sesuai dengan harapan masyarakat dan putusan konstitusional mk saya menerima banyak surat dari kpud yang akan menjalankan pemilihan kepala daerah ini menunjukkan betapa seriusnya permasalahan calon independen
510606 revisi ini juga untuk menghapus kesan partai politik berupaya menghalangi calon independen paling lambat lima bulan terakhir atau sampai bulan desember 2007 sudah rampung jadi awal tahun 2008 bisa dilaksanakan
510607 jadi calon independen tidak sekadar aksesori demokrasi tetapi merupakan kebutuhan
510608 ini kan bisa menjadi ukuran popularitas akseptabilitas dan kapasitas figur bersangkutan sehingga yang tampil nanti bukan calon independen yang asal asalan yang cuma mengandalkan kapital
510609 pemerintah harus menjalankan keputusan itu jangan sampai mengingkarinya mau pakai perppu atau yang lain terserah lebih cepat lebih baik
510610 bolehlah hal itu tidak dilaksanakan dalam pilkada dki karena waktunya tidak memungkinkan kalau di daerah lain harus dilaksanakan
510611 kita dorong agar pemerintah mengeluarkan perppu kalau aturannya tidak segera keluar bisa jadi kontroversi
510612 saya siap memelopori untuk dating ke jakarta khusus masalah ini
510613 misalnya pemerintah dan dpr tidak segera merevisi uu 32 2004 begitu juga dengan perppu pemerintah tidak segera mengeluarkan aturan tersebut sedangkan revisi tidak jalan kalau seperti ini kpu daerah bisa mendesak kpu pusat mengeluarkan peraturan seperti diamanatkan mk
510614 dari rapat itu bisa saja muncul pertimbangan yang menyatakan sudah saatnya untuk lampung segera diterbitkanya payung hukum untuk mengantisipasi masalah pascaputusan mk itu saya yakin kpu provinsi telah menyiapkan agenda itu
510615 kami pikir langkah paling baik menunggu revisi uu 32 2004 atau menunggu perppu tanpa dua itu kpu tidak bisa menindaklanjuti karena kpu bukan pembuat undang undang hanya pelaksana
510616 untuk pengaturan calon independen ini tidak perlu dibuat pp sebab revisi uu no 32 2004 akan kita buat secara rinci termasuk masalah teknisnya
510617 mengapa masyarakat lambar harus menerima beras miskin raskin padahal tanahnya subur dan panennya melimpah sekarang kita ubah kemiskinan ini menjadi sejahtera
510618 saya siap maju dalam jika masyarakat menginginkan saya pribadi tidak akan pernah mengajukan diri ikut pilgub jika masyarakat menginginkan saya siap maju
510619 lewat jalur independen atau perahu parpol itu soal proses tapi rekrutmen pemimpin selayaknya lebih demokratis jika lewat parpol jika calon yang diajukan parpol tidak memenuhi aspirasi masyarakat tentu masyarakat akan mendorong calonnya maju lewat jalur perseorangan
510620 calon perseorangan itu warning buat parpol mau tidak mau parpol harus lebih hati hati menjalankan tugas dan harus lebih aspiratif jika tidak ingin ditinggalkan
510621 jangan happy dulu dengan keputusan mk seharusnya kita berhati hati karena makin banyak calon independen yang maju berarti makin rusak demokrasi di negara ini karena itu membuktikan parpol kita sudah rusak dan tidak dipercayai lagi oleh masyarakat
510622 keberadaan forum ini diharapkan dapat memberikan masukan dan menekan dpr dan pemerintah segera menyelesaikan payung hukum dari keputusan mk tersebut
510623 kalau ada kesengajaan mempersulit calon independen misalnya melalui persyaratan ini bisa memunculkan people power karena sejak dahulu rakyat selalu anti pada kekuasaan yang arogan
510624 its time to press on with the reform policies i promise to do my utmost to create a society where the people can live with peace of mind
510625 i will work consistently to share the same views as the people
510626 what people want is the replacement of the prime minister
510627 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realisation of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
510628 we have told the european countries that every country including iran has the right to engage in uranium enrichment and to possess nuclear power stations based on agreements
510629 what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day
510630 their tears are our smiles and in the end we will roar with laughter
510631 by freeing a murderer like de juana chaos the government has turned us into orphans
510632 we are here to tell the murderers we are going to fight to end the impunity they enjoy
510633 this is gay the other team is only gonna get murdered lets pick th teams again
510634 come on this is football you cant play without getting hurt
510635 there is a simple test to tell whether your mission in life is over or not if youre alive it isnt
510636 heres the deal abe if youre absolutely sure ill win the case ill give you the business
510637 but before i can give you my opinion i obviously need to know the facts
510638 so now youve heard everything do you think i can sue my partner and get my money back
510639 from what ive just heard its clear to me that you will win its rare to have such an open and shut case
510640 theyve increased credit loss expectations for the past three quarters and this next one is probably going to be the fourth
510641 turbulent market conditions lie ahead would probably be an understatement
510642 tragicamente como todos sabem milh es de vidas de mulheres est o sendo afetadas agora

510648 a lot of sites out there are designed from an adult perspective
510649 i havent heard of it being done before its a very nontraditional means of getting website development ideas
510650 refers to a target customers perception and interpretation of all the stimuli encountered while interacting with a firm
510651 disappointed that spammers have had such an impact that email marketing or even e mail notification of free online content with no money involved is breathing its last
510652 now laws may be called the performances or tangible results of political science how then can a man acquire from these the faculty of legislation or choose the best we do not see men made physicians by compilations and yet in these treatises men endeavor to give not only the cases but also how they may be cured and the proper treatment in each case dividing the various bodily habits well these are thought to be useful to professional men but to the unprofessional useless in like manner it may be that collections of laws and constitutions would be exceedingly useful to such as are able to speculate on them and judge what is well and what ill and what kind of things fit in with what others but they who without this qualification should go through such matters cannot have right judgment unless they have it by instinct though they may become more intelligent in such matters
510653 god i have to stop playing the game and start making this real
510654 you dont have to be threatened by him ben my plan is just right for you dont worry

510665 i iya maksud saya ada masalah apa dengan nama yang mulia
510666 aku tidak pede menaklukkan dunia dengan namaku yang sekarang ini dalgude
510667 aku akan mengganti namaku dalgude seluruh dunia akan takluk di bawah nama baruku hahaha
510668 dengar baik baik aku akan mengubah namaku menjadi lord sauron
510669 lho nama itu bukannya sudah dipake di serial lord of the rings yang mulia mungkin cari nama yang lain lagi
510670 he sudah dipake kalo begitu aku akan menggunakan nama voldermort
510671 gimana sih ini gak boleh itu gak boleh ya sudah daripada repot mendingan aku pake nama simpel aja pangeran matahari
510672 sekali lagi hamba mohon ampun yang mulia tapi nama itu juga sudah digunakan oleh bastian tito di serial wiro sableng
510673 kupret yang simpel gitu juga udah kepake kalau begitu nama mana yang belum dipake

510676 jadi sebenarnya apa yang terjadi pada joe tabib ban bebi
510677 maaf tabib bobo ban bebi tapi kami tidak mendengar ucapan anda bisa diulang
510678 itu lho genteng di atas udah bolong kalau hujan pasti bocor
510679 walah ya sudah jangan lupa nanti minum obat dulu sebelum maju perang
510680 kalau tidak salah seminggu yang lalu lord croaz menyetujui ijin cuti jendral uderzo penasehat istrinya kan baru saja melahirkan
510681 kita mulai rapat ini dengan lima orang jendral yang hadir saya serahkan mimbar kepada yang mulia lord croaz
510682 seperti yang mungkin sudah kalian ketahui malam ini kita akan berangkat melalui hutan fangar untuk mulai menyerang kerajaan oro untuk memudahkan rute kalian dianjurkan menyusuri sungai poko di ujung terluar hutan fangar hanya ada satu desa kecil yang menjadi penghalang untuk mencapai kerajaan oro bumihanguskan saja desa itu
510683 mohon maaf tapi kalau cuma satu desa kecil apa tidak sebaiknya salah satu dari kami saja yang menyerangnya lebih efektif dan hemat biaya yang mulia
510684 apalagi berdasarkan informasi yang sebelumnya telah disampaikan oleh penasehat mereka sama sekali tidak memiliki pasukan pelindung tentunya akan mudah sekali menguasai desa kecil seperti itu
510685 tidak perlu mengirim ribuan pasukan hanya untuk membumihanguskan satu desa kecil yang tak berdaya kirim saja jendral peyo yang sedang pilek itu bersama beberapa ratus orang pasukan
510686 lord croaz sekarang kan sudah saatnya minum susu kok belum diminum susunya kalo dingin kan nggak enak nanti dimarahi ibu suri lho
510687 yeeee nanny bolobolo kok datangnya sekarang sih ini kan baru rapat
510688 jangan suka ngambek ah jelek banget ayo diminum dulu susunya ini kan bagus buat kesehatan

510694 terima kasih atas perhatian kalian semua aku jadi tidak enak merepotkan saja
510695 ada bumi ada langit ada hitam ada putih ada kekuatan tentu saja ada kelemahan
510696 selama ini kita mengenal joe yang sangat kuat cepat dan tahan banting kita tidak menyadari bahwa di balik kekuatan yang begitu besar tersimpan kelemahan yang pada akhirnya tidak bisa disembunyikan begitu saja oleh kekuatan alamiah
510697 err sumpah aku gak ngarti apa maksudnya tabib ban bebi bisa diperjelas
510698 lord croaz sedang bersiap menyerang kerajaan oro mereka akan menghancurkan desa minou terlebih dahulu penyerangan pertama hanya akan terdiri dari beberapa ratus orang saja dipimpin oleh jendral peyo tugas mereka hanya satu menghancurkan desa minou
510699 ya itu tempat tinggal bobo ban bebi kita harus memperingatkannya aku tidak bisa meninggalkan jaggar tapi kau bisa
510700 bilang saja kamu disuruh ibu suri mencari jamur di hutan fangar untuk dibuat jamu awet muda
510701 bilang saja jamunya hanya bisa didapatkan tepat sebelum matahari terbenam bohong dikit napa sih susah amat ini masalah genting hidup mati orang banyak akan tergantung kepadamu
510702 halah dasar lelaki tua busuk pokoknya aku tidak mau tau malam ini kamu harus segera memperingatkan bobo ban bebi di desa minou pakailah kuda tercepat yang bisa kau ambil dari istal
510703 aku tidak biasa mencuri kuda dari istal mencuri itu dosa
510704 waduh jangan jangan kita belum punya kalimat khas ya barov
510705 a anu tapi aku bisa pinjem duit dulu gak buat uang saku siapa tau nanti kehausan di jalan
510706 it aint what you dont know that gets you into trouble its what you know for sure i
510707 ah tidak siang ini joe aku cuma mau membawa betsy jalan jalan ke padang rumput di sana biar dia makan rumput dengan bebas
510708 kebetulan pak muldoon ini sedang menganggur jadi aku ajak saja menemani
510709 ikut ngobrol sama kami joe kita bisa makan sama sama
510710 ooooh kirain makan rumput hahaha nggak deh pak terima kasih saya banyak kerjaan nih mungkin lain kali
510711 oh iya saya ada beberapa potong ubi rebus tadi pagi saya bawa untuk bekal ke hutan bapak bapak mau saya ambilkan dulu di pondok
510712 aduh nggak usah deh terima kasih kacang yang dibawa muldoon sudah lebih dari cukup kami nggak lama kok
510713 dia sangat kuat jauh lebih kuat dari manusia biasa lihat saja cara dia membelah kayu sepertinya mudah sekali tanpa mengeluarkan keringat benarkah dia bukan berasal dari desa ini
510714 walaupun anda pendatang muldoon aku heran anda belum pernah mendengar kisah kedatangan joe di desa kita kisahnya cukup unik
510715 musim panas dua puluh dua tahun yang lalu jonaz dan morrey bump menemukan sebuah kotak kecil mengapung di sungai poko saat mereka sedang bertamasya ke rumah nenek
510716 jadi benar cerita itu joe bump ditemukan terapung di sungai
510717 hahaha becanda kok makanya kalau aku sedang cerita jangan dipotong iya benar mereka menemukan seorang bayi seorang bayi laki laki yang sangat lucu dan kuat hampir seharian mereka berusaha mengembalikan sang bayi kepada orangtuanya sampai sampai lupa bertamasya ke rumah nenek karena tidak kunjung menemukan orang tua atau orang lain yang berada di sekitar aliran sungai dan bisa dimintai keterangan tentang asal muasal si bayi maka jonaz dan morrey memutuskan untuk membawa pulang dan merawat bayi itu di desa ini mereka menamakan anak itu joe bump aku yang menulis surat adopsinya
510718 jadi tidak ada yang tahu dari mana sebenarnya joe bump berasal
510719 sampai akhir hayat mereka jonaz dan morrey merawat joe dengan penuh kasih sayang mereka menganggap joe sebagai anak sendiri setiap kali aku bertanya pada mereka apakah mereka tidak ingin tahu darimana sebenarnya joe berasal mereka selalu menjawab joe berasal dari surga dia adalah anugerah dewa bagi mereka aku selalu tersenyum mendengar jawaban mereka bagi jonaz dan morrey kehadiran joe memang menjadi berkah tersendiri seorang putra yang hadir bagi dua orang tua yang kesepian
510720 sayang kedua orang tua yang baik hati itu sudah meninggal
510721 saat datang ke desa ini aku masih sempat berkenalan dan beberapa kali berbincang bincang dengan mereka pernah sekali waktu jonaz dan morrey datang ke rumah hanya untuk memberikan kue jahe bikinan sendiri padahal kami tidak begitu kenal dekat hanya pernah bertegur sapa saja di pasar
510722 mereka benar benar patut ditiru pasangan yang saling mencintai sampai akhir hayat jonaz meninggal terpaut dua bulan setelah istrinya meninggal mereka seperti tak terpisahkan
510723 kalau kamu yang aku panggil tidak perlu meneriakkan kata kata itu dalgude
510724 mulai hari ini akan kusebarkan ketakutan ke seluruh penjuru negeri akan kutanamkan kekuasaan dari ujung ke ujung seluruh dunia akan menjadi milikku hahaha seluruh aesterra akan menjadi milikku hahaha semuanya akan menjadi milikku hahahahaha
510725 apa yang mulia lupa kalau tadi siang makan pete rebus dan tumis jengkol
510726 terima kasih sudah mengingatkan wahai dalgudeku yang bloon tapi setia
510727 pasukanku sudah siap dalgude malam nanti mereka akan bergerak kumpulkan para komandan di aula aku ingin berbincang bincang sebentar dengan mereka sebelum pergi bertempur
510728 siap yang mulia kita sudah menyiapkan strategi serangan ke dua arah posisi pertahanan kita juga sudah terjaga dengan aman yang mulia hanya tinggal menentukan arah saja ke mana kita akan memulai invasi kita yang mulia barat atau timur
510729 kita akan memulai invasi kita ke timur ke wilayah kerajaan oro menyeberangi hutan fangar dan menyusuri sungai poko daerah mana yang akan kita taklukkan terlebih dahulu dalgude desa atau kota
510730 hanya desa kecil biasa yang sebagian besar penduduknya adalah petani dan peternak letaknya tidak jauh dari sungai poko dan hutan fangar tepat di perbatasan oro dan gargan tidak akan ada masalah untuk menguasainya lusa esok pasukan kita pasti sudah sampai di sana

510755 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
510756 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
510757 the room had to be dark for the good reason that a sharp image requires a small pinhole but a small pinhole also produces a dim image
510758 to get a brighter image without lenses you have to use many pinholes the problem then becomes how to assemble the information including depth information from the overlapping shadow images this is where coded apertures come in
510759 what would happen if we put a ura right next to an object we were imaging with the x ray beamline it should allow us to create a holographic image one with orders of magnitude more intensity than a standard hologram
510760 imaging with coherent x rays will be a key technique for developing nanoscience and nanotechnology and massively parallel holography will be an enabling tool in this quest
510761 transformed from a limited constitutional government to a highly centralized welfare warfare state
510762 the invasion of vietnam was deliberate and calculated as were policies and strategies that bordered on genocide and were designed to force millions of people to abandon their homes experimental weapons were used against civilians chemicals banned in the united states agent orange were used to change the genetic and environmental order in vietnam

510767 we can see the strained yet still ordered interface structure that opens up a wide pathway for ions to be conducted
510768 the new layered material solves this problem by combining two materials with very different crystal structures the mismatch triggers a distortion of the atomic arrangement at their interface and creates a pathway through which ions can easily travel

510779 the palpable truth is that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs nor a favored few booted and spurred ready to ride them legitimately by the grace of god
510780 the tags primarily consist of naturally occurring pollen a substance that evolution has provided with extraordinary adhesive properties
510781 it has been given a unique chemical signature by coating it with titanium oxide zirconia silica or a mixture of other oxides the precise composition of this coating can be varied subtly from one batch of cartridges to another enabling a firm connection to be made between a particular fired cartridge and its user
510782 were currently focusing on understanding the precise requirements of the police and cartridge manufacturers
510783 but our work clearly could make a valuable contribution not only to solving gun crime but also to deterring criminals from resorting to the use of firearms in the first place
510784 the avant garde is arrears artists are selling themselves like hot cakes art is a good thing art education is a holy schmo business artists are jobbing the lousy government is in this war one doesnt know what one can do about it the art critics are all corrupt the art critics are the curators and theyre also the art collectors and assistant art dealers too the good old art words are dead things are awful artists make telephone directions for making art instead of making art themselves some people still think the mass media can explain things artists are like businessmen
510785 hello customer thanks for having us in okay i think the best thing to do is start off by showing you our product
510786 graphene is a great material for electronics but it would be even better if it were possible to create devices with crystallographic edges that is edges where the atoms lie along single lines in the graphene plane
510787 standard etching techniques being used in the semiconductor industry do not allow this sort of fabrication instead they produce rough edges with lots of atomic scale defects that limit the performance of the fabricated devices

510793 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
510794 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
510795 for all i know our navy was shooting at whales out there
510796 how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
510797 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
510798 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
510799 in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach
510800 the most extraordinary exchange takes place when lt gen michael delong bemoans shrinking political support for neo con war plans on capitol hill and suggests that sympathy for the bush administrations agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack
510801 rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9 11 is wearing off and the behavior pattern of citizens in both the u s and europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror
510802 so i can understand the argument for not writing something that was rejected uh maybe my attitude always towards editors is theyre mice training to be rats but the point is jejune if you know what that means

510805 we cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred fanaticism and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric
510806 we have only to see the rapid integration within association of south east asian nations asean and its emergence as an important bloc in asia to understand the opportunities that beckon
510807 terrorists and extremists know no borders the recent attack on the indian embassy in kabul and the serial blasts in bangalore and ahmedabad are gruesome reminders of the barbarity that still finds a place here in south asia we must act jointly and with determination to fight this scourge we must defend the values of pluralism peaceful coexistence and the rule of law
510808 these terrorist attacks are a rapidly growing threat not just to afghanistan or india but for the entire saarc region
510809 no amount of outrage and condemnation can suffice to express the anger and frustration we all feel when faced with such mindless brutality and violence in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of benazir bhutto
510810 the deadly fangs of terrorism are spreading across the region they threaten to disrupt peace and stability we must combat this menace of terrorism across the broadest possible spectrum
510811 terrorism has perpetrated brutal attacks in every part of the world we condemn the heinous terrorist attacks in afghanistan india and pakistan in recent times which caused unnecessary loss of valuable lives and property
510812 unequivocally condemned these senseless and reprehensible acts of violence regardless of how sublime noble and even desperate a cause may be
510813 shattered the entire value system of peoples and interferes with socio economic development
510814 in its entirety once we are satisfied that the grave of communalism has been finally dug yet
510815 for nehru and many in india abdullahs kashmir was proof of the secular ideal for this predominantly moslem state chose to remain allied with india
510816 seemed to give conclusive evidence that the communal parties did not have much support in india and that the goal of a secular state was a near reality
510817 in this context of general satisfaction with the election results sheikh abdullah chose to accuse india of being weak in the very sector in which india felt she had shown her greatest courage and strength of purpose
510818 by the wholly misconceived praja parishad and jan sangh agitation which produced strong reactions in the kashmir valley
510819 the mother was always working and rockefeller essentially raised the child
510820 but ultimately he refused to say who he was and she got custody
510821 when i said we have to kick udaikkanum those in karnataka opposing supply of water to tamil nadu i was referring to those who indulged in violence and not everyone in general yes i should have been more specific
510822 i have been quoted as saying that i have learnt my lesson well life is all about learning
510823 as a senior technician and as someone who has been in the industry for 40 years i wish to say that what has happened has and whatever happens hence will be for our good
510824 this is an issue pertaining not just to kuselan but to all tamil films i say this as someone observing the industry from a distance
510825 rajini only said that if his words had hurt anyone he regrets having said that
510826 he had not apologised he had only said that he was concerned that his words had possibly hurt the people of karnataka
510827 we wanted to honour the technicians involved in the film and the director and producers readily agreed i hope this trend continues
510828 i will follow this practice of sharing a portion of profits made on a film with technicians in my upcoming films too soundarya has agreed i will be speaking to director shankar too
510829 considering this there has to be a certain amount of give and take an additional protocol is generally very intrusive but it should not be with the case of india
510830 advance notice in most cases is at least 24 hours
510831 if india wants to compromise on certain issues the process can be expedited but if it decides to remain firm and not compromise it could take a little longer
510832 matters started moving only when iaeas board of governors began asking for it
510833 an additional protocol is not mandatory but in the case of india it has become mandatory as a result of the indo us nuke deal
510834 the perpetrators are worse than animals devoid of conscience and human and religious values also we express our deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of the innocent people killed and injured in the bomb blasts
510835 the indian government must institute an independent inquiry and bring the coward perpetrators to justice we pray for the peace in our country
510836 it was terrifying to hear of the attacks when i have many in laws in the city i called them and they are okay but one of the bombs went off at a hospital where both my cousin and aunt work i thank god none of my family members were hurt but i pray for those who injured in the incidents
510837 well be there if we can get away with it
510838 obama for america campaign is a different type of campaign

510845 for four days senator john mccain and his allies have accused senator barack obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true

510847 authorities say their use of a taser weapon should not be questioned
510848 we called the police my wife was afraid he was going to get ran over or hit
510849 he looked a little agitated but other than that he didnt look to be falling down drunk or anything like that
510850 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody lying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
510851 according to the doctors all injuries are consistent with a fall
510852 they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we dont know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
510853 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation
510854 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him
510855 he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers
510856 i told the guys that today is the day you find your locker
510857 today is the day we go through the training room and just listen today is a good first day it is one of the best days of your life i told them not to worry about first team or second team to just listen and that is the attitude we will take onto the practice field

510863 hmmm dats very inter resting how come they didnt find water during the apollo missions
510864 the moon damn i thought that was mars crap i announced the wrong mission

510892 one night i was roused from my sleep by a rap at the door and i heard the deacons voice exclaiming arise abraham the day of judgment has come i sprang from my bed and rushed to the window and saw the stars falling in great showers
510893 but looking back of them in the heavens i saw all the grand old constellations with which i was so well acquainted fixed and true in their places gentlemen the world did not come to an end then nor will the union now
510894 there is uncertainty as to whether the company and group will be able to continue to trade as a going concern and therefore whether it will be able to pay its debts as they fall due however the directors are confident in the ability of the company and group to continue as a going concern in addition the company and group has negotiated new and ongoing borrowing facilities with its lenders
510895 if the financial support of lenders is withdrawn the company and group may be unable to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and adjustments may have to be made to reflect the situation that assets may need to be realised other than in the normal course of business at amounts which could differ significantly from the amounts at which they are currently recorded in the statements of financial position
510896 since the accounts were published the business has been performing very strongly and generating very strong cash flows
510897 the process we are in is very clear in that we are looking for an injection of funds for growth and i think that speaks for itself
510898 the business is in a very sound position theres no question about that whatsoever
510899 hell operates at the gourmet end of the pizza market and the effects of the economy are playing out slightly differently in different parts of the country

510907 i have to just keep looking forward down the track and taking it one step at a time those things arent behind me im still going through the process
510908 ive just got to keep going about my things and play good footy and let my rugby do the talking
510909 for what jimmy has gone through this year and the last couple of months plus the injury on top of that he showed amazing amount of guts and what it meant to him to be in the jersey
510910 my last start was in rustenburg its something i really cherish tonight it was probably a big moment for me two losses for this lot we have had a lot of pressure throughout the week and to come out and have a good win is great
510911 we have all been under pressure jock hobbs and the board the administration the team the new zealand rugby public just wanted a performance and they got a performance tonight that was right out of the top drawer
510912 it will give us some foundation some confidence and a wee bit of relief from the pressure
510913 so we can build from there hopefully but the game in cape town will be massive and the game in brisbane will be massive
510914 both teams playing in those two encounters will be absolutely on the edge of the edge so its going to be pretty special
510915 im very proud of the team i though they played exceptionally well it keeps us alive in the tri nations and the bledisloe cup
510916 we dont underestimate the magnitude of that task we have two away games now but it was a fine performance and im very proud of the guys who did the job
510917 we learnt a lot from last week the players learnt a lot the coaches learnt a lot we changed the game plan around and the guys executed that exceptionally well
510918 i thought the front five had a hell of a big game
510919 they the wallabies never got any front foot ball and some of the tackles that went in forced turnovers
510920 we put the ball at the right end of the field that came about from pressure and we camped down their end of the field for periods and got the points we were after
510921 i thought they australia played bloody well last week and i thought we played pretty well this week i think the next contest is going to be massive because both teams will have equal edge
510922 i think its just edge and the tactical approach as wayne said every dog has its day and it just happened to be our day

510950 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
510951 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on

511032 anyone with a compact computer case will tell you that finding a good heatsink can be a daunting task after tracking down the best heatsinks available for your budget theres the question of heatsink heights to factor in this is where the new thermaltake duorb heatsink comes in this heatsink features twin 80mm fans set side by side so cooling surface area isnt sacrificed for keeping the total heatsink height under 90mm the duorb is novel in a couple of other aspects
511033 today we have the distinct pleasure of looking at the results of the crazy minds over at bfg tech and some of their cutting edge technology you see the gang over at bfg is never satisfied and personally thats the way we at bjorn3d like it fast is never fast enough and there is always room for more a great mantra when it comes to technology though not so great when it comes to driving on the road thankfully the crazy engineers over at bfg arent allowed to leave the facility and must work on nothing other than creating the fastest cards around the card we are speaking of today is none other than the gtx 280 h oc edition from bfg fitted with the newest full face water block from dangerden and overclocked for good measure this is one serious card but underneath all of the copper and silicon lies a softer side a greener side you see this card doesnt just churn out frames faster than anything youve ever seen before it also likes to save you money by using less power while its not gaming read on to find out what other wonders this card holds and if it deserves a spot in your next build

511038 via caused quite a stir a few months ago when the company first revealed initial details regarding their low power nano processor at the time the product was referred to by its internal codename of isaiah and the president of the design center that was tasked with making the processor was decidedly outspoken which made for some exciting reporting when news of the isaiah core first broke we hopped on the line with glenn henry vias centaur design center president and got many questions answered regarding the processors architecture features expected performance and the companys plans for the cpu we also covered the official announcement of the via nano processor and detailed the exact models that would be available at launch one thing we hadnt been able to do however was a direct performance comparison of the via nano processor versus intels recently released atom which is target at the same market segment thankfully we were recently given the opportunity to take a via nano reference platform for a spin to see what it could do and will be presenting our results for you here today

511146 nobody wants to go on the dl no matter what it is
511147 there is always a letdown when you cant be out there but i think its best in the end to get this thing worked out and taken care of
511148 im a big believer in once a guy gets to the big leagues i dont want him to sit around and think about it
511149 i want him to get out there and play as quickly as possible
511150 this customary law in our opinion doesnt really exist because the fifa regulations have been changed many times in recent years

511153 he wants the best and he wants to relate to us that there are some things that hes not going to bend on

511156 il padrino 2 di cui abbiamo svelato i primi dettagli in un vecchio articolo vedr la luce in un periodo che va dalla fine del 2008 ai primi del 2009
511157 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
511158 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
511159 the room had to be dark for the good reason that a sharp image requires a small pinhole but a small pinhole also produces a dim image
511160 to get a brighter image without lenses you have to use many pinholes the problem then becomes how to assemble the information including depth information from the overlapping shadow images this is where coded apertures come in
511161 what would happen if we put a ura right next to an object we were imaging with the x ray beamline it should allow us to create a holographic image one with orders of magnitude more intensity than a standard hologram
511162 imaging with coherent x rays will be a key technique for developing nanoscience and nanotechnology and massively parallel holography will be an enabling tool in this quest
511163 second winning the nobel prize does not automatically qualify you to be commander in chief i think george bush has proved definitively that to be president you dont need to care about science literature or peace
511164 real life is not college real life is not high school
511165 presenting an all new action packed confrontation between marvels mightiest super stars
511166 one of the most underrated people in the history of comics
511167 an idea has to be a little new to be at all true
511168 i think of us as just a rock and roll band a rock and roll band thats letting the roots show
511169 i have been playing guitar for 13 years specializing in early acoustic and electric jazz guitar for the last six
511170 just for personal reasons and you know because its miley and theyre gonna do good were gonna do good too the audience is gonna vote so well see
511171 were not gonna see it until its live so i have no idea
511172 yeah i was surprised it got so big that we had to do it somewhere like this
511173 the tension is building up and people are getting nervous were gonna smoke the audience
511174 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
511175 his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story
511176 he was not drunk he was drinking hours and hours before
511177 if i do play well if i do start playing well like i did today i think i would be an addition to the team
511178 and if i dont play well i would not be i would not expect a pick i just want to play as well as i can and see where it takes me
511179 im a long way out of it at the moment and i need to show excellent form
511180 ive got four tournaments left and i need to play well in those
511181 if i do he may consider me for a pick if i dont ill be watching it on tv like everybody else
511182 all summer long and probably the past three to four months ive pushed and pushed and pushed and tried too hard and practised too hard and worked too hard
511183 ive wanted to play too well too much whereas now im just playing and enjoying it and seeing what that brings
511184 its really good to get back on to pure greens again as good as these are and start rolling in those four or five footers to save par
511185 i havent been making those this year and that puts me on the back foot straightaway like anybody ive gone back to my old method wider stance and slightly higher hands
511186 if you look back at that period in time it kind of overlapped the 80s and the 90s and i kind of felt like that may have hurt them
511187 i was hoping more people would be recognized and i hope a number of other guys get in too
511188 i have strong feelings about this in part because i played for him
511189 he had no ego had great common sense and had an intensity for the game he was extremely creative and fostered things that are still in todays game because he was so creative i think hes affected a lot of coaches and id like to see him get in
511190 i hope it doesnt take him 13 years to get in
511191 i have an idea of what i want to do and it will definitely be part of a nice package for my wife
511192 i want all of the hall of famers to come back for it because this is where i did it it takes time to work some of these things out because everyone has a busy schedule
511193 you know it took me six years to get in here it may take me six more years to get it done again
511194 i got to go against him one on one in practice
511195 his greatest skill was his nasty and relentless desire to play football on game day he was an inspiration for his teammates
511196 hes a guy i watched a lot and i thought he was one of the best ive ever seen
511197 when i think of jared i think of taking family trips to disney and giving him piggyback rides at disney

511212 dealing with the press is something that youve gotta start getting used to
511213 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding
511214 theres no feud theres nothing to feud about so why start a fight
511215 its something that we all have to live with and unfortunately it involves friends
511216 im not interested in being anybody but myself and im not here to replace anyone
511217 i think that shes a wonderful performer and of course its a compliment but i would like to take a different route
511218 i would love to step out of disney and maybe do a couple of roles maybe challenging roles and fun roles new things like that
511219 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
511220 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
511221 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
511222 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
511223 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
511224 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
511225 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
511226 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
511227 when i get older i will be stronger theyll call me freedom just like a waving flag
511228 and do you really want to hold my dirty hands
511229 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
511230 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
511231 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
511232 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
511233 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names
511234 we were down to finding nowhere and broken media and we all voted for broken media
511235 total teenage drama its like us making fun of girls because we say they are talking on their cell phones listening to the radio looking in the mirror and trying to fix their hair
511236 we thought we should make it about people who would say lol
511237 sold juelzs contract to parent label def jam for 2 million
511238 but its still dip set 4 life its just going to be a new chapter
511239 i have no hard feeling for cam after all he did give me a chance but i will say this i was loyal to him and he took advantage
511240 it was pretty much the same with the last record
511241 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
511242 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
511243 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
511244 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
511245 the right to a fair and impartial judge is of particular importance in the present cases
511246 whatever ultimately happens concerning the judge this does not mean these cases go away
511247 it will just take longer to get them to trial however i may seek to have the decision overturned
511248 weil ja 20 zehn und zehn ist und zehn ist gerade und zwei gerade zahlen zusammen sind ja wieder gerade
511249 h stimmt und wenn ich zwei ungerade zahlen zusammenz hle wie ist dann die zahl die dabei rauskommt
511250 actually the okada man was hit by another vehicle and he fell into the brt lane and because the brt bus was on a very serious motion the driver was not able to maneuvre he just crushed the okada rider to death instantly
511251 i was there and i saw everything with my eyes anybody that said the okada man was hit by another vehicle was telling you a big lie
511252 the next thing was that his hands shook and he lost control totally and fell down and due to the speed of the brt bus the driver also could not control himself he just crushed the guy and he died immediately
511253 the greatest thing about radio is its ability to deliver advertising to a very selective audience
511254 who would be a part of the death rates that would increase
511255 ich sehe nicht ein warum ich der einfalt anderer wegen respekt vor lug und trug haben sollte
511256 she blames me i blame the dog the dog blames the baby squirrel running around the basement rafters in the middle of the night well it had to be one of us who deleted all the home shopping channels and only the home shopping channels from the hundreds and hundreds we get on our fiber optics tv my wife figured i came down in the middle of the night grabbed the remote quietly turned on the tv and surreptitiously deleted half her tv shopping channels that would include two of the four channels in 130s and the four in the 540s
511257 it aint what you dont know that gets you into trouble its what you know for sure i
511258 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
511259 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
511260 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
511261 just cos you feel it doesnt mean its there theres always a siren singing you to shipwreck dont reach out dont reach out x2
511262 got my imagination flickerin like hot flames its how it seems you make me wanna ride the coltrane to a love supreme
511263 so feed me a kiss chapped lips and all and ill bring back the tape of an empires fall
511264 and when i say it out loud i look like a schlemiel but i gotta do it anyway tell you how i fee
511265 and i wonder when i sing along with you if everything could ever feel this real forever if anything could ever be this good again the only thing ill ever ask of you youve got to promise not to stop when i say when
511266 i put myself in this position and i deserve the imposition but you dont even know im alive and this pounding in my heart just wont die im burnin up
511267 be careful how you touch me my body is an earthquake ready to receive you minds making glaciers metals for my soldiers lets be like strangers touching for the first time
511268 youre just a sinner i am told be your fire when youre cold make u happy when youre sad make u good when u are bad
511269 so what do i do ive got a slightly sick feeling in my stomach like im standing on top of a very high building oh yeah all the stuff they tell you about in the movies but this isnt chocolate boxes and roses its dirtier than that like some small animal that only comes out at night
511270 it doesnt make no sense no its not convenient no it doesnt fit my plans but i got that taste in my mouth again oh
511271 we will take part in any negotiations and talk about any issue which consolidates our nuclear rights
511272 iran will not give an inch on its nuclear rights
511273 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
511274 syria strongly stands by iran and will not change its stance
511275 we have told the europeans that syria believes that any country including iran and based on international treaties has the right to enrich uranium and have a nuclear power plant
511276 the zionist regime has lost its raison detre is no longer able to direct us and european policies in the region and is therefore naturally heading for annihilation
511277 some countries are wrong to try to create divisions between iran and syria which will always remain by each others side
511278 the us should start pulling out of iraq and any us administration which gets to power has to do it
511279 this was an inhumane act by the bloody separatist terrorist organisation
511280 el mundo no est en peligro por las malas personas sino por aquellas que permiten la maldad
511281 many great intelligent talented academy winning actors standing by awaiting a major press conference to show their support
511282 the ad is a bit ironic given that mccain has been the most pop culture savvy republican candidate in quite some time
511283 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
511284 johns been a celebrity ever since he was shot down
511285 obama has almost transcended that and has become famous as a famous person which is why they are comparing him to paris hilton
511286 for the time being obama maintains the edge and has the strength of a majority of electoral votes his triumphant foreign trip allows him to continue to define this race but too many of these states are close and a sizable number are undecided or choosing a third party candidate so there is a lot of fluidity
511287 we should be able to deliver bottle hot water to dehydrated babies
511288 hes too new and he needs to put some meat on his bones
511289 walked the grand canyon rim to rim in august 2006 and hikes whenever he can find the time according to john d
511290 its very difficult to eat well when youre constantly on the road attending dinners lunches barbecues
511291 probably want someone who takes care of his health as an example of the kind of personal discipline necessary to do the job
511292 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president of the united states or mr universe
511293 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day

511319 first i would show what justification is or what i suppose is meant in scripture by being justified a person is to be justified when he is approved of god as free from the guilt of sin and its deserved punishment and as having that righteousness belonging to him that entitles to the reward of life that we should take the word in such a sense and understand it as the judges accepting a person as having both a negative and positive righteousness belonging to him and looking on him therefore as not only free from any obligation to punishment but also as just and righteous and so entitled to a positive reward is not only most agreeable to the etymology and natural import of the word which signifies to pass one for righteous in judgment but also manifestly agreeable to the force of the word as used in scripture

511414 the horror of what has happened here will give me pause for thought the next time my son chooses to travel by greyhound

511417 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
511418 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
511419 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
511420 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
511421 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
511422 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up

511424 theyre saying thank you for building our hospital and bringing us doctors
511425 it will be the best the newest and the most beautiful
511426 thats why i got into politics so i wouldnt have to work for a living
511427 i look at you today and i think about how very far burera has come
511428 and i believe this hospital symbolizes hope and unity its about everything thats good about our future and overcoming the parts of our past that have to be dealt with
511429 ive been here in 1998 and told them i was sorry
511430 but i do feel a lifetime responsibility i feel like a lot of people you know you had something to do with it
511431 when i left the white house i told rwandan president reuben kigame that i felt i should do whatever i could for the rest of my life to help them become whole and make a new beginning
511432 nocera has probably put a lot of researchers out of business
511433 this is probably the most important single discovery of the century
511434 the beauty of this system is its so simple that many people can immediately jump on it and make it better
511435 by 2048 all american adults would become overweight or obese
511436 the results of the study show clearly how the future situation might become if current trends continue
511437 it will never come to pass that all americans are overweight not even in 2048
511438 that may be a statistical possibility but not a real one
511439 however the other prediction of 86 percent by 2030 could very well happen were almost there
511440 i think they overestimate the eventual percentage and do not take into consideration the likely asymptotic nature of the curve
511441 i think the rates of overweight and obesity are still increasing at a disastrous rate
511442 given that people in the u s continue to eat more and move less i am not surprised at these findings
511443 the reasons are complex but can easily be summarized by too much food and too little exercise highly palatable cheap foods are abundant the focus on exercise is absent in most americans lives yes i think the predictions will come to pass
511444 perhaps the authors of this paper did not consider the newer data
511445 this is not to say that the problem is not significant and carries a tremendous cost to society and a burden on the health care system but i do not honestly believe that we will hit the 86 percent mark for overweight and obesity
511446 kids may be getting overweight more slowly but in certain groups the news isnt good
511447 mexican american and african american kids fare the worst and the children in the upper percentiles seem to be gaining faster than the rest of the child population
511448 also we have to remember that well be sending more of our children into adulthood with obesity so more of them will already be at a disadvantage
511449 to close the gap we need to fix everything thats broken from neighborhoods without sidewalks to the high price of produce to food marketing to children to misleading health claims on food packages to school days devoid of physical activity and school cafeterias devoid of healthful offerings the list goes on and on
511450 u s eating habits are nowhere near where they should be
511451 the average american eats 50 pounds more meat and 20 pounds more cheese per year compared to the 1960s i would strongly encourage americans to adopt more vegetarian meals
511452 we talk and dont do people are walking encyclopedias of information but making small changes over time is key
511453 in the u s our all or nothing approach to weight management wont work slow and steady wins the race
511454 predictions should always be viewed as possibilities not guarantees but the information presented in this study should cause all americans to focus on how they can change behaviors to promote health their health
511455 if the projected numbers do or do not come to be this study is a good wake up to the fact that americans arent taking control of their own health
511456 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
511457 we will see what iran does in two weeks but i think the diplomatic process now has a new kind of energy to it
511458 if they do not decide to suspend then we will be in a situation where we have to return to the security council
511459 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
511460 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time but to give us a usable answer to our offers stop dallying

511468 the greatest traffic jam in the history of s f a dozen old fashioned new years eves thrown into one the biggest and most good natured crowd of tens of thousands ever to try and walk the streets and guide their autos on them this was the city last night the night of the bridge opening with every auto owner in the bay region seemingly trying to crowd his machine onto the great bridge and those who tried to view the brilliantly lighted structure from the hilltops and also view the fireworks display were numbered also in the thousands every intersection in the city particularly those near the san francisco entrance to the bridge was jammed with a slowly moving auto caravan every available policeman in the department was called to duty to aid in regulating the citys greatest parade of autos one of the greatest traffic congestions of the evening was at fifth and mission streets with down town traffic and bridgebound traffic snarled in an almost hopeless mass to add to the confusion traffic signals jammed and red and green lights did not synchronize police reported that there was no lessening of the traffic over the bridge all lanes being crowded with oakland or san francisco bound machines far into the night
511469 structurally deficient means that some or all of the components of the bridge might not meet their original design capacities they may have degraded in some way
511470 not everything is expected to remain in a new and pristine state
511471 across california more than 13 percent of the 23 000 bridges have been classified as structurally deficient a term that can mean the paint is peeling from a span it has too many potholes or in the worst case is at risk of failure

511503 racial profiling may explain why incarceration rates are so high among young african americans law enforcement officials may be targeting blacks and other minorities as potential criminals and are using the vehicle code as a tool to stop and search them
511504 it appears that official and public scrutiny of profiling behavior by police can lead to substantial reductions in arrests of minorities although this enforcement reduction may carry the unintended consequence of encouraging crime in minority areas

511536 in 2000 and 2003 the park did not need planning permission for its rides due to its status as an amusement park but it had recently reached a different view
511537 it would establish the use of the land on which they stand as an amusement park on which other major attractions could be constructed without needing planning permission
511538 we have a much better picture of the extent of the damage and the prospects for repair i have spent the last couple of days contacting as many people in the amusement park industry as possible to satisfy myself that the skills and expertise are available to repair the scenic railway several people who know the scenic railway well and who have maintained the ride over the years have told me that repairing the structure will not be a major task they are also willing and able to get involved with the restoration in addition companies which are specialists at reconstructing and replicating wooden roller coasters in the uk and overseas have confirmed that given the extent of damage plans can be drawn up and the ride rebuilt i have forwarded these details to dreamlands owners with all this local knowledge the expertise of wooden coaster specialists and the hundreds of photographs of the ride i am now convinced that a rebuild is possible and achievable

511566 islam does not distinguish between the american people and the american government since both are in a state of war with islam
511567 the new ftc study shows that there is a lot of marketing aimed at children and lets be perfectly clear it was not spent urging kids to eat fruits vegetables and whole grains the food industry spent a billion and a half dollars urging children to eat fast food sugary cereals soft drinks and other unhealthy foods
511568 using the same proven techniques which now persuade parents to buy non nutritive foods for their kids
511569 parents are at the mercy of madison avenue when it comes to feeding their children nutritious foods
511570 and the only reason kids love fatty salty sugary stuff is because theyre victims of slick marketing the succotash industry is wise to employ the tactics of the enemy for the benefit of our children
511571 were still trying to get steven spielberg to agree to a scene where sasha baron cohens king julien character eats a bowl of succotash or at least expresses his love for it
511572 however we categorically deny rumors that gloria the hippo will give birth to a baby named succotash
511573 were still in focus groups with slogan development but its an uphill struggle thanks to warner brothers sylvester the cat most americans associate succotash with suffering and speech impediments
511574 theres progress being made i wouldnt say as much as id like at this point so were going to continue to push him
511575 i think pushing him back into two a days will help him as well
511576 coach bill belichick had me come in team meeting i wanted everyone in the organization to be there
511577 it was awesome it got a little bit emotional and im starting to become an emotional wreck a little bit because its here
511578 we let him know about our appreciation for what he has done and congratulated him on his selection and soon to be induction into the national football league hall of fame this weekend
511579 although i never coached andre i saw a lot of him from my perspective as the defensive coordinator of the giants i watched him when he played for the patriots and of course that was an era of a lot of great linebackers
511580 what you see in the discovered portrait is a fairly detailed picture of a dutch rural lady very similar to those van gogh painted in the same period
511581 its sold out so hopefully we can get one tomorrow
511582 its out of stock they will get some tomorrow so well be here tomorrow
511583 everything that they do is highly polished and if there are hiccups they normally ride them out very very quickly and right the ship
511584 i think apple was under a lot of pressure to essentially do a magic trick and pull the veil off of these products on one day which was july 11
511585 could have spread this out over time they could have launched mobileme and then the new iphone and then the new software for the old iphone and they could have avoided a lot of this

511587 therefore there are roughly 225 000 more people living with h i v in the u s than previously suspected
511588 the previous estimate was 1 million to 1 1 million
511589 we are not effectively reaching men who have sex with men and african americans to lower their risk
511590 u s efforts to prevent h i v have failed dismally
511591 if there was security in the south why would we come here
511592 we will stay here even for 10 years until the bombardment ends
511593 do you know the taliban entered kandahar city and broke into the prison
511594 there were armored vehicles on the hill and they were firing there was a heavy bombardment and planes bombed too
511595 they did not differentiate between the guilty and not guilty
511596 we left our houses because we had no power to resist the taliban or the government
511597 anytime the taliban fired a shot from our houses then the coalition the government and the police came to the area and hit us
511598 the government comes and arrests us and then the taliban come and arrest us as well
511599 there was fighting in the village a hundred times roadside bombs bombardment firing and shooting
511600 the taliban are coming during the night with heavy weapons riding on vehicles and we cannot even dare ask them to leave because if they see someone at night outside they will slaughter them and accuse them of being spies
511601 his mother was cooking and he was lying beside her
511602 the whole village was destroyed and after that we left
511603 we should not ignore or conceal the deaths of unarmed civilians that resulted not from the mistakes of a few soldiers but from systematic aerial bombing and strafing
511604 history teaches us that we need an alliance but that alliance should be based on humanitarian principles
511605 we thank the american troops for saving our country from communism for the peace and prosperity we have today
511606 does that mean we have to shut up about what happened to our families

511619 judging by these surveillance photos you should get that thing on your ass looked at
511620 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits
511621 winter officially ended this week so thats good news yeah today al gore blamed the end of winter on global warming sunday of course is easter another big problem for barack obama this easter sunday wheres he gonna go to church easter of course is the time we celebrate miracles see we dont have miracles like easter and the resurrection and the parting of the red sea anymore you know what im saying like today our idea of a miracle is gas under 3 50 a gallon boy there is nothing but disasters in the news its unbelievable floods in the midwest fires in texas the democratic party its just unbelievable to give you an idea how bad the democrats are doing in a stunning reversal john mccain now 10 ahead of hillary clinton and 7 ahead of barack obama and this is after iraq a recession and no health care imagine how far ahead hed be if the republicans had actually done something this week john mccain received a warm welcome in israel he was in israel you know he is hugely popular in israel ever since he stood with the jewish people against the pharaoh theyve never forgotten president bushs approval rating has reached a record low 31 wow his popularity is so low now on his facebook page he only has imaginary friends the cover of time magazine asked the question what did hillary do as first lady well we know what she didnt do bill and osama bin laden has released another anti american speech and out of force of habit barack obama denounced the remarks and said he wasnt even in the room at the time the statements were being made anyway critics are pouring over osama bin ladens latest audio tape simon called it pretentious paula said it was not his best work and randy said dog its just not working for me according to a new study by the university of british columbia and harvard money can buy happiness but only if you spend the money on someone else to which former governor eliot spitzer said see according to the new york post eliot spitzer has entered therapy for his sex addiction he has sex addiction hes not horny a sex addiction see i dont know if its gonna work when the therapist told him it was 300 bucks an hour he said what can i get for an extra 50 have you heard about this playgirl magazine made an offer to eliot spitzer to appear naked in the magazine isnt that unbelievable i tell you you know who really wants to see that spread former new jersey governor jim mcgreevey in tibet the rumor is the dalai lama might be stepping down yeah it turns out he was client number 11
511622 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
511623 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
511624 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
511625 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
511626 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
511627 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
511628 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
511629 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
511630 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
511631 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
511632 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street
511633 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
511634 we thought it was going to be guilty and when we saw the jurys faces not one of them showing they were for him we just
511635 not convert two or more partial identifications into a positive identification

511639 life doesnt always have to be about moving forward life is standing still and a quest to find balance

511641 life doesnt always have to be about moving forward life is standing still and a quest to find balance
511642 as a woman who has been raped and as an anti rape activist i have a right to not be raped you have a right not to be raped we all have the right to decide what happens to our bodies and once you take that away that is when evil starts to happen
511643 i am not obligated to give that money away it is mine
511644 i am not obligated to give that kidney away it is mine
511645 i refuse to give you this time it is mine
511646 no but to come to a womans blog who has just written about her experiences with feeling as though she does not own her body as a queer disabled woman of color and say to her that no she doesnt own her body as though thats your call
511647 home is the place where when you go there they have to take you in
511648 despite concrete steps to advance peace and democratic development in sierra leone women who constitute 49 percent of registered voters are under represented and continue to face significant challenges to full participation in politics
511649 women in local governance is pivotal in our fledging democracy and development strides
511650 i built community markets for the women i established rice mills for women farmers which improved their production of rice and subsequently their income i constructed eight primary community schools in villages where there had never been schools i gave scholarships to 70 girls and i even extended some of my projects to other wards were womens needs are desperate
511651 now there is only one woman in the council i wonder how much she will be able to accomplish for women but i know the men in the council will not be able to address the needs of women because they do not relate to womens issues
511652 i wonder if the new councillors dominated by men will continue to support the mill when the whole project has been grounded on womens empowerment my family has practically been managed from the proceeds my wife gets from her rice business
511653 we only got a clinic for the first time in our community when we got a female councillor if big politicians are threatening the women refusing to give them symbol for them to stand for the elections then things will not develop in this country
511654 the northern region of the country where i wanted to stand for councilor really needs female representation because that part of the country has the highest rate of female illiteracy so much so that the government had to institute affirmative action in giving scholarships to female students how could we close the gaps in education if we are not there to push for these interests
511655 democracy is all about numbers and the fewer women in council means the less impact women will make to address their issues
511656 they could raise their voices even beyond their council or influence the chairperson of their council to seek womens welfare

511671 llegamos a un acuerdo amplio ellos bien lo saben estuvimos a muy pocas horas de firmar ese acuerdo hasta que como se al uno de ellos en su propia declaraci n les pusieron un freno de mano que impidi firmar el acuerdo
511672 ese freno de mano es una raz n pol tica por lo tanto mal se podr a decir que no hubo conversaciones
511673 como ha dicho el ministro cort zar ellos han cambiado de posici n varias veces en cierto momento eran cr ticos despu s acercaron posiciones con el ministro estaban a punto de firmar cuando intervinieron los senadores novoa y allamand se retractaron entonces no sabemos todav a cuando llegue el momento de firmar de verdad cu l va a ser su decisi n final

511680 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
511681 and if we can come up with a genuine bi partisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something i am open to
511682 i think is a positive step so there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bi partisan group
511683 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
511684 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
511685 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional offshore drilling is wrong
511686 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
511687 and what that means is that were going to try to get things done at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done

511732 im pleased with that i got good traction off the line and was able to pick up the slipstream from at least three cars on the run down to turn one i opted for the outside line and swept past mike conway
511733 after that i struggled a little bit on the first set of tyres but the team called me in at exactly the right time and the car felt much better balanced on the second set in the second stint i just focused on looking after the car and keeping the tyres in good shape it was one of those days when i simply had to get as much as i could from the race and i really dont think i could have done any more
511734 i got too much wheelspin at the start the clutch map seemed to have reset itself and i just didnt get away as cleanly as i would have liked
511735 i had a little bit of understeer prior to the tyre stops but felt i was closing slightly on bruno then we fitted fresh rear tyres and the understeer got worse after the stops i just stroked it home really the car was good enough for a top four finish but i just needed a little bit more if i was to challenge for the podium
511736 trident racing experienced a mix of feelings today during race 1 mike had a great race reacting to an unfortunate start that cost him a couple of positions we scheduled an early pit stop so we called him in sooner than possible allowing him to push on a clean racetrack the laptimes were great and mike managed to recover two spots on his main rivals we knew that in the end with older tires he might have some troubles but the brit managed to keep behind and take 6th place were very sorry for what happened to ho pin tung he made a great start as usual taking 12th place but was hit from behind by alvaro partente in the opening lap despite the yellow flags waving for a contact between grosjean were sure the chinese driver would have been able to fight for a really deserved points finish without that incident
511737 i had another great start today managing to move from 17th to 12th during the first lap i came to turn 5 and saw the yellow flags due to the incident happened between pantano and at that point i felt an impact from behind and found myself turned around with my car stalled i was hit by parente a few seconds after the start and i dont know what to say i think such manouver was really unprofessional at that point i was in front of and im sure to have lost a concrete chance to score some extremely important championship points
511738 it was a tough race really my start was not perfect but thanks to the good pace i kept after the early pit stop i was able to take a couple of spots back in the closing stages i have to resist on some very deteriorated tires i knew that any little mistake would have allowed to move on but i stayed focused and kept 6th place im now fully concentrated on race 2 ill start from third eyeing a podium finish
511739 as it has been the case too often recently we finished outside the points even though we were quick enough to mix it with the front runners its all very frustrating j r me was well on the pace today and he would have finished in the top eight without the problem during the pit stop kamui again put on another of his amazing fight backs but finishing the first lap in seventeenth place effectively scuppered his chances
511740 i made a good start and i was able to match the pace of the leaders without problems in the opening laps we decided to do the pit stop fairly early on and it was the right decision but i lost five seconds because of a jammed wheel nut which ruined my race its very frustrating to finish just outside the points and only one place off tomorrows pole but thats racing
511741 our aim was to score points today and to start from a good place on the grid for tomorrow we didnt achieve it once again i had a problem at the start and that spoiled my race im going to analyse the reasons for this with the team this evening and make sure it doesnt happen again i reckon we can still score some points though
511742 our day didnt start well today and were thankful that there were no serious injuries
511743 wed hoped to make it into the top ten today and although we didnt quite do it were not far outside it so were hoping to move further forwards in tomorrows race with diego michael was driving well this weekend but was just caught out with the tight pit lane entrance which was disappointing as hell now be starting at the back for tomorrow well have our full crew with us tomorrow and well be ready to make it into the top ten with diego
511744 i am upset about s move i know it was a race incident but it left giorgio without any chances in this race javi did a good job during the second half of the race but also he suffered from problems and could not make up the positions he needed to get into the points
511745 again we suffered from problems with the clutch in the formation lap the clutch already started to slip and i had to cool it down not being able to prepare my start properly as a consequence my tyres were not up to their temperature and i lost a lot during the beginning of the race as so often this year we have a well balanced car which could be seen during the second part of the race but facing so many problems there is little we can do
511746 we did a great start and i moved up i passed as he made a mistake but he hit me in the back this caused me to spin and i found myself at the end of the field i kept pushing but no more was possible
511747 they havent yet reached the holy grail of i want to go from here to there show me my options

511937 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation

512048 we have to remember that the model is not the disease
512049 if you want to maintain a constant level of inhibition with more neurosteroids you need fewer receptors
512050 after pregnancy when hormone levels drop off you need more receptors to maintain that level if you cannot maintain that level after pregnancy thats when the disorders manifest
512051 our thinking is that postpartum depression and maybe premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder may be due to impaired trafficking of these gaba receptors to the neural membrane
512052 we dont know if this is the same mechanism in humans but i think all indications are there
512053 the women that are affected by the disorder the hormone levels are not changed they are not different than in unaffected women so we are confident that it must be the receptor trafficking mechanism that is affected because the changes in hormone levels are pretty normal

512131 i would rather die standing up than live my life kneeling in front of you
512132 when you cant make them see the light make them feel the heat
512133 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
512134 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
512135 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
512136 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
512137 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
512138 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
512139 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
512140 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
512141 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades
512142 it would be a mistake a misinterpretation to think that a huge rollback or reversal of fundamental trends is under way
512143 distance and trade costs do matter but we are still in a globalized era
512144 theres just a handful of us left but it has become easier for us domestic folks to compete
512145 this is not just about steel but also maple syrup and avocados and blueberries at the grocery store
512146 avocado salad in minneapolis in january is just not going to work in this new world because flying it in is going to make it cost as much as a rib eye
512147 being green is in their best interests not so much in making money as saving money
512148 green companies are likely to be a permanent trend as these vulnerabilities continue but its going to take a long time for all this to settle down
512149 cannot take a risk that the just in time system wont function because the whole global trading system is based on that notion
512150 they are going to have to have redundancies in the supply chain like more warehousing and multiple sources of supply and even production
512151 despite everything the american economy is still the biggest rottweiler on the block
512152 but if its expensive to get products from there to here its also expensive to get them from here to there

512223 our hitting responded today and we did what we needed to do to win i think the young kids saw what it was all about friday and they stepped up today
512224 it just wasnt meant to be the last couple of days
512225 we just couldnt get anything going and we left too many runners on base unfortunately thats the way it happened
512226 they came out aggressive and cross wasnt able to get into any kind of rhythm
512227 before we knew it they had five runs on the board and that was the game but carson is 16 years old and he has three more years left at this level along with some of the other kids this experience will be valuable down the road
512228 we played hard the whole time but sometimes you dont get the breaks
512229 we made a nice run to get here and it seemed like everything went our way just to get to the tournament we feel like we can compete with anyone but we had a couple of rough innings that got to us
512230 i think during the winning streak we just played relaxed and when we came here we were all tense and we didnt pay attention to the small things
512231 we were trying to do too much trying to tie that game with one swing of the bat

512253 i got to go against him one on one in practice

512366 you people back home want to tell us when we can come back home and take up a normal life but most of us are only civilians in uniform who are fighting for the right to be civilians again as civilians we are also businessmen who have not forgotten what stands in black and white in the contract our old job is guaranteed us within six months of the end of hostilities what happened to democracy
512367 just as it begins to look as if we will return home in the foreseeable future these dogs back home are squabbling and yapping again i am 100 in favor that each of them should have the same chance here at the front
512368 wherever jews have settled in large numbers they have had a harmful effect on morality and integrity they stay separate and are not assimilated they form a state within the state and seek to destroy a nation financially if people oppose them this was the case with spain and portugal if you do not exclude them from the united states in less than 200 years they will be here in such numbers as to rule the land and change the form of government for which we americans have shed our blood sacrificed our lives and property and risked our freedom if you do not exclude them in less than 200 years our posterity will work in the fields to feed them while they sit in their offices i warn you gentlemen if you do not exclude the jews your children will curse your graves jews gentlemen are asiatic wherever they are born and however many generations removed they may be they will never change
512369 money rules the world and the have nots will have to accept that fact
512370 they could hardly say anything to cromwell without him putting his hand to his heart raising his eyes to the heavens and calling god as his witness he will weep and lament and moan all the while sticking the knife in your ribs
512371 we are numerically in the minority but our fingers tip the scales
512372 american lawlessness begins in childrens rooms and schools and ends in courthouses and lawmaking bodies
512373 the united states of america is owned and controlled by a hierarchy that at its core consists of the 60 richest families of the country to which at most 90 families of somewhat lesser wealth may be included these families are the center of the modern industrial oligarchy that controls the united states they function discretely under a de jure democratic form of government behind which a de facto government of abolutistic and plutocratic nature has existed since the civil war
512374 we should pass a law which says that a man who is worth 100 million may not be brought to trial then our laws would at least correspond to reality
512375 i see several tens of millions of our citizens a significant part of our population who even today lack much of what we consider the absolute minimum necessities of life i see millions of families who must live with an income so modest that the pale of family disaster hangs over them day by day i see millions in the cities and the countryside whose live under conditions that a so called decent society would have termed indecent even fifty years ago i see millions to whom education recreation and the possibility of improving their lives and those of their children are denied i see millions who lack the means to buy the products of our factories and farms and who through their poverty deny work and productivity to millions of others
512376 the freest government will not long survive if wealth is concentrated in a few hands while the great masses of the people become dependent and poverty stricken
512377 my ancestors came to america from holland over 300 years ago i am not worried about whether or not they were jewish
512378 there are many families named hall in the usa some of jewish origin others of christian origin from germany or england
512379 if i wanted to get my dick wet id pour water on it
512380 for what was gone with the wind after the civil war was the old america in which people were judged by their human worth and their real value not by their fortune or bank account
512381 until the civil war the population of the united states was almost entirely of nordic stock but the needs of the feverishly growing american industry for cheap submissive workers preferably with limited english led to a flooding of america with eastern european and jewish masses drawn from everywhere driven by the most primitive mass instincts they were only superficially capable of assimilation the population of the united states already seriously compromised by the negroes became a hopeless jumble
512382 if one applies european concepts to the united states one sees that within a few decades the anonymous rootless power of capital crushed and destroyed the old nobility the free and independent citizenry and the independent farming class if one may use a frequent and often misused word human freedom itself was destroyed the methods were different but the results identical with what happened under bolshevism with the same ice cold contempt for humanity
512383 national socialism within a few years made unemployment that terrible specter of modern humanity into only a nightmarish memory roosevelt despite the new deal and billions of dollars was never able to bring the unemployment figure under ten million
512384 chicago is filled with chaos more than any other american city that i know it seems to me the very model of america for america too is filled with chaos terrible chaos filled with excess destruction and desolation
512385 it was not the goal of this book to discuss whether america can win the war or whether it must lose it but perhaps it has become clear and that was my goal that america does not deserve to win the war and spread its system over the entire world there is nothing in the american system worth imitating either for germany or europe if americanism conquered the world it would mean the end of all human values and of genuine freedom the freedom to do something not from something of all the values for which europe has fought and suffered for millennia for which it has given all its strength of body and soul no european could exchange places with an american america is a pitiable country and the americans are a betrayed people betrayed by their leaders betrayed and deceived in a simply indescribable way by their self chosen leader franklin delano roosevelt he spoke of helping the common man but filled his election campaign fund with donations from uncaring capitalists he began by wanting to loose the capitalist chains but became as much a tool of morgan as any of his predecessors
512386 wheras the american papers beyond doubt are carrying a tremendous amount of material about germany from their regular correspondents and no number of interviews from all kinds of people who recently have been in germany all this material and be it even just a report is skilfully presented in such form which seemingly intentially aims at being equally offensive for hitler and his new government through ridiculing his deads as giving nourishment to anti german sentiment
512387 the world war was won not with the sword but with the pen this is a german opinion which is shared also by a good many americans apart from now one might think on this subject nobody today would deny the fact that the pen if used as a weapon can proove to be a mightly deadly sword if now we wish to liquidate the world war if we seriously endeavour to promote world peace to promote good relationship between the nations of the world it seems to be absolutely essential that we should stop using war weapons and stop tolerating warlike propaganda in other words we should do all we can to prevent endangering good relationship between countries claiming to be well acquainted with german political troubles of past years as well as with the mentality of the german people i feel that the american newspaperreader is not at all put in a position to get a clear and true conception about germany above all it is to my mind equally silly as it is preventing the education of the american people if the american newspaperreader is left to believe that the germans are a barbaric nation the absurdity of such statements does not make them less dangerous to good relationship between the american and the german people if in the following i am dealing with the fundamental achievement and the fundamental aim of the german national socialistic revolution i am doing it for the benefit of a better understanding between the american and the german people this better understanding is the more necessary the more we wish to prevent that a few years of animosity between the two countries should be permitted to destroy a century old friendship between the american and the german people contrary to political custome hitler said in his address to the masses on the tempelhof field on may 1st that he is not going to tell the workman how important for the nation the labourman and his work are and turn around and speak to the intelligent class of people as if to the cream of the nation and turn around again and speak to the peasant telling him how valuable he is on the contrary he is going to demonstrate to one class of people the importance and the value of the other this attitude is not only wise but it also reveals the mystery of this sudden sense of unity that has come over the german people when i am going to apply the same methods while writing to america about germany it is because making one people understand and respect another people might equally well proove to be the best method to bring about the much longed for mutual understanding between the nations of the world the german nationalsocialistic revolution beginning on january 30th still in full swing today and going to be carried out furthermore for an indefinite time to come is a revolution of mind it is a revolution of the national mind as well as of the social mind of the people only a short time ago american correspondents and travelling newspapermen used to report from germany that the growing of the hitlerite party was the outcome of general dissatisfaction and hardship if this had been the case if hitler had gained support merely on the ground of promising the same bread and work with all of his page missing possibility of such development before taking place in germany hitler succeeded in changing the minds of his followers from the communist rank and file they no more are communists but nationalsocialists they have killed in themselves that hatred they felt towards the rich and towards the white collar man in general to an equal extent as this white collar man and this rich man have been made to no more look down upon the workman or anybody doing manual labour it is true not all of germany has turned to nationalsocialism however while for this very reason hitlers revolution still is in full swing and will be carried out furthermore until such time when this final aim is reached a new election if held today might well show an increase of the nationalsocialsit vote from 17 5 million on march 5th to close to 30 million out of a total electorate of about 44 million votes hitlers revolution of mind as i have tried to explain it in no way is representing a danger to world peace and again it seems strange that hitlers assurances to keep peace frequently are ignored in reports printed in the foreign press as impressive as this german revolution of mind might be to the foreign observer who knows germany and the german people it is only reasonable that it cannot be equally impressive to those americans who not yet have had a chance to visit and get acquainted with germany after all this new german spirit is nothing new to us in america republicans and democrats both call it the true democratic spirit the workman in america always has been as much respected as the white collar man and our boys have long been working their way through college through manual labour however for this very reason it seems to me that no people is better equipped mentally to understand this new germany and its leader than the american people if when writing about the germany nationalsocialistic revolution i would fail to touch the jewish problem in germany the reader indeed would miss an important explanation to a new german attitude which has created worldwide interest and partly even new animosity endeavouring to from and impartial point of view seek an explanation for this change in germany one must realize two outstanding facts one is that the percentage of jews in germany indeed is exceptionally small and the other is that this small percentage in postwar years has enjoyed an undue large share of public influence while moreover a great many jewish names are connected with all kinds of affairs of administrative corruption of postwar germany thus making it all the easier for hitler and his followers to gain countrywide support when calling for a radical reduction of the jewish influence it is wrong to regard this attitude as an affront to the jewish religion this it is not instead this attitude is directed against a postwar political system which has discredited the marxistic parties in germany and the jews since many of them have played such prominent part in cooperation with those parties and the many cases of illoyalty and dishonesty they have been connected with when i said above that the small percentage of jews in germany in postwar years so far have enjoyed an undue large share of public influence this was possible because of their close cooperation with the marxistic parties in other words it was not superior ability which entitled them to such share but political pull until recently conditions in germany indeed were of such kind that many a christian student would cease studying since he had to realize that his road of future was blocked by political interests whereas the jewish student would keep on studying knowing perfectly well that his father although perhaps a businessman and not a politician nevertheless had sufficient political pull to pave his way in such development the new germany sees a controlling increase of the jewish element in the field of education which the jewish population percentage in germany does not justify hand in hand with this development the possibility of marrying has thus been made so much easier for the young jewish generation which fact in turning no doubt is contributing to increasing the population percentage of the german jews to the disadvantage of the other confessions such developments are of no little importance for germany and while today under the hitler government a radical change is being made this radicalism is not directed against each single jewish citizen on the contrary the form in which the new laws are being applied show a liberal spirit and reveal the truth that the attitude of hitler germany towards this jewish problem ought to correctly be regarded as directed against a political system of corruption with which the german jews unfortunately so impressively have identified themselves

512596 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
512597 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
512598 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing

512600 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing

512603 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
512604 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
512605 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
512606 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives

512625 quindi signore se lo desidera prenda il suo bagaglio a mano che un posto in prima classe la attende

512764 the military option must be kept on the table given the destabilizing policies of the regime and the risks inherent in a future iranian nuclear threat either directly or through nuclear proliferation
512765 our closest allies the u k australia and canada other long standing alliances nato japan and south korea foremost among them we will work to expand and strengthen other relationships including with india
512766 there is a lot of strategic thinking concerning iran going on right now but no one has yet to make a decision what to do
512767 we are still far away from the point where military officers are poring over maps together planning an operation
512768 this way they will be able to say they tried everything
512769 this increases americas chances of gaining more public support domestically as well as the support of european nations which are today opposed to military action
512770 no matter what they do it is our money it is our weapons and they are not going to do it without us approving it
512771 if they israelis get in trouble we are going to bail them out
512772 as todays briefing showed us there are strong reasons to suspect that iran was working covertly and deceitfully at least until recently to build a bomb
512773 iran has refused to explain or even acknowledge past work on weaponization
512774 when combined with irans determined effort to master the technology to enrich uranium
512775 uranium enrichment is not necessary for irans civil program but it is necessary to produce the fissile material that could be weaponized into a bomb
512776 a blockade is a major military operation too its an act of war
512777 the intensifying saber rattling and war of words between the us and israel on one hand and iran have generated a great deal of hysteria war fever and confusion
512778 technical capabilities that could be applied to producing nuclear weapons if a decision is made to do so
512779 is that israel does not acknowledge that it has nuclear weapons
512780 planning commitment and action toward multilateral nuclear disarmament by nuclear weapon states
512781 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
512782 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
512783 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
512784 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
512785 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
512786 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
512787 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
512788 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
512789 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
512790 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
512791 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
512792 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
512793 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
512794 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
512795 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
512796 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
512797 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
512798 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
512799 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
512800 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
512801 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
512802 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
512803 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
512804 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
512805 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
512806 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
512807 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
512808 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
512809 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us
512810 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
512811 a policy that consists of keeping all options on the table must be maintained
512812 they the west know that the iranian nation is after using nuclear energy to provide electricity but they say because this work gives you capability we will not allow it
512813 the iranian nation does not pay attention to such talk and will continue with its path
512814 taking one step back against arrogant powers will lead to them to take one step forward
512815 the idea that any retreat or backing down from righteous positions would change the policies of arrogant world powers is completely wrong and baseless
512816 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
512817 is there a difference of emphasis it certainly looks as though there is
512818 the military option although always available is not our preferred route
512819 we have made that point clear to them and the world in our public statements and private meetings
512820 a policy that consists of keeping all options on the table must be maintained
512821 is a sovereign state and we understand that they view this as an existential threat and we take the threat thats posed by iran seriously as well
512822 may the regime occupying jeruslem dissappear from the pages of time
512823 may the regime occupying jeruslem dissappear from the pages of time
512824 neither side wants to show that it is losing face or that it is caving in or appeasing the other side but both sides are interested in finding a way out of this conundrum
512825 the iranian reply should come in the next few days
512826 the situation today is that we want a clear reply to the question solana asked in geneva
512827 for the moment the iranian response has not been clear enough
512828 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat
512829 whenever the enemies have failed against this nation they have tried to make excuses but the iranian nation will stand against them with its power
512830 comments like those arent productive he should instead be focused on the generous incentives package weve offered
512831 iran is continuing to advance toward a military nuclear capability and is heading towards a major breakthrough
512832 for us such a situation that iran will have a nuclear power is unacceptable
512833 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat
512834 whenever the enemies have failed against this nation they have tried to make excuses but the iranian nation will stand against them with its power
512835 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act

512867 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
512868 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
512869 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
512870 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
512871 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy

512875 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
512876 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
512877 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
512878 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
512879 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
512880 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
512881 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
512882 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
512883 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
512884 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
512885 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time

512889 over the last several months the downtown hearing office has gone hog wild on scheduling
512890 ive gone from five hearings a month to five a day
512891 it used to be very uncommon that you would have a claim where someone would die while their appeal was pending
512892 unfortunately that is becoming much more common people are dying from what they are complaining of
512893 all i know is it is a very bad practice and we have moved as quickly as we can to provide redress
512894 whatever it is you think you are you arent a good friend unique well read good looking or smart well now you know

512904 they played exceptionally well to keep us alive it was a fine performance tonight
512905 tactically they played very well we changed the game plan and the guys executed it exceptionally well
512906 he showed what it meant to be in the jersey
512907 it was essentially a mirror of last week the all blacks built pressure and didnt allow us to build any pressure were very effective on the gain line were very effective at the breakdown and as a consequence we werent able to get into the game
512908 we anticipated the intensity we anticipated their approach it wasnt perfect but they still profited from it
512909 theres still a long way to go it wont be the last time we lose and well win another game at some point as well
512910 i think we put too much pressure on ourselves in not executing things well right across from the lineout to the breakdown as well
512911 when they the all blacks come with that sort of intensity and we make those sorts of mistakes then it puts them on the front foot and its very hard to recover from that
512912 its obviously very quiet and disappointed but i still think the effort the guys put out there was massive unfortunately it didnt go our way
512913 the harder we tried the more we more we dug ourselves into a hole well lick our wounds we get a break of a week or so and well regroup and look forward to our preparations for south africa where we play two important matches

512925 less asinine was mccains two pronged lie that obama would rather lose a war than a campaign and that he snubbed injured troops in germany the former is repulsively low life and you can tell mccain knows it because he has a weird habit of saying it and then grinning broadly and humming a little to himself as a semi laugh he doesnt own the statement even as he says it the statement itself is about as uncivil as it is possible to be close to calling him treasonous right and the troop snub jibe is simply demonstrably untrue as the mccain camp was forced to semi concede so mccains main moves these past two weeks have been either childish or disgusting and both times he has signaled he didnt really believe his own message he doesnt seem like a serious president to me

512935 in the quiet words of the virgin mary come again
512936 he called me and i had to stop and think when he asked me if i could use some help
512937 at first it got treated like i was doing it for the publicity
512938 and i knew i had to convince people i wasnt
512939 he showed up on wednesday and introduced himself and told the guys he would know every one of their names by friday
512940 i remember talking to biscuit the afternoon of one game and he was just kinda sluggish not really into it
512941 i asked him how he was feeling he said he was hungry he hadnt eaten all day thats not something that had occurred to me thats when i started bringing subway sandwiches
512942 the whole thing was what i needed it was just coaching these guys wanted to learn and you could see results im really happy i had that experience even though it came out of something negative
512943 thats as great a feeling as ive ever had on a football field
512944 i loved being there but i didnt love the reason
512945 we had some interesting players like toast patterson the cornerback who used to mix whisky in with his chewing tobacco when it ended i was hoping the chargers would take another look but it wasnt the case
512946 well i guess if you dont feel youre good enough to compete in the pac 10 thats probably the best thing for you

512950 after that tom started flexing his knee and saying he was ok
512951 it was really a 30 yard pass and dokie took it 40
512952 but im glad to know ricks still telling that story
512953 just to change things up rick actually had played all right

512969 theres a way to deal with simple problems on a small scale
512970 you will get disastrous results you end up either getting stuck or resorting to some form of violence
512971 power without love is reckless and abusive and love without power is sentimental and anemic
512972 we dont have a choice between power and love we have to do both
512973 we need to cross the stream by feeling for stones
512974 there was no paradigm no precedent nothing we had to carve it and so perhaps we were more willing to listen
512975 there are a couple of areas where i sometimes despair about our capacity to deal with what lies ahead
512976 one is our cognitive characteristics and the other is the self reinforcing nature of our economic system
512977 a real handicap when it comes to dealing with slow creep problems we just dont see the change and the thing about slow creep problems is they may be slow creep for a while but then all of a sudden theres a non linear shift and we find ourselves in a crisis
512978 we simply dont have a vision of an alternative economic system that isnt oriented toward unending material growth
512979 until we have an alternative vision or theory we wont give up the one we have
512980 many of us come to believe that the reality outside our constructed world needs little attention because if we ever have to we can manage any problem that might arise there
512981 on a day to day basis most of us in rich countries are increasingly sealed within the hermetic and sometimes illusory world of the human made the human scaled and the human imagined
512982 our receptivity to critical signals that might awaken us to our deep ignorance of the potential consequences of our actions and warn us against hubris
512983 there is a temporal order in dealing with our big problems
512984 first we have to change how we view the world and that will cause us to change how we act
512985 suddenly have a worldwide network technology where we can basically all have a conversation together
512986 we havent really understood that our challenge isnt to preserve the status quo but rather to adapt to thrive in and shape for the better a world of constant change
512987 comfortable with constant change radical surprise even breakdown and must constantly anticipate a wide variety of futures with a prospective mind were better able to turn surprise and breakdown when they happen to our advantage
512988 the creative renewal of our technologies institutions and societies in the aftermath of a breakdown

512993 are emerging in response to cascading ecological crises and human suffering
512994 radical social change the reinvention of market based economies the empowerment of women activism on all levels and the need for localized economic control
512995 we should all feel sick in some way experience some sense of despair because that is normal
512996 makes us human and brings us more deeply in touch with our heart the enormity of what is passing away is almost unspeakable its not just species and ecosystems but entire cultures the seasons civilization itself
512997 cautioned that civilization is a movement not a condition and the rise of uniformity consistently marks its decline
512998 strongly emphasizes that the early expressions of religiosity that arose during the axial age were not theocratic systems requiring belief but instructional practices requiring action
512999 coheres into a values system but not a belief system
513000 our courage and reverence and will are locked up in paralysis released when we feel what we see and allow it in
513001 we are turning to nature not merely as balm but as designer mentor guide and muse kenny ausubel of bioneers puts it aptly when he says the solutions in nature surpass our conception of what is possible moreover this is equally true about our human nature what to do engage ones community become more generous cooperative and enthusiastic creativity abounds and our imaginations are limited only by what our mind believes
513002 a simpler way to lead organizations one that requires less effort and produces less stress than our current practices
513003 we need to play by the rules of the planet and you dont need any religion to tell you what they are they are clear principles that you find in science but also in spiritual traditions in the form of understandings such as interconnectedness and impermanence
513004 unnatural mega systems that dont work they are crumbling and collapsing around us and we are the casualties stressed out disconnected from each other moving too fast without a moment for reflection or a really good conversation
513005 change never happens as a result of top down preconceived strategic plans or from the mandate of any single individual or boss change begins as local actions spring up simultaneously in many different areas
513006 doesnt change one person at a time it changes as networks of relationships form among people who discover they share a common cause and vision of whats possible
513007 community is the unit of change the only way we get through difficult times is together yes you work at the level of the individual but particularly today people are so caught up in small personal and interpersonal dynamics a downward spiral of narcissism and egotism that they just cant get over themselves
513008 this kind of time has disappeared from our lives and we need to reclaim it
513009 whether its through rowing or running or meditation we must have time where we start to feel centered peaceful focused
513010 the kind of breakdowns were experiencing may force more collaboration and community on us but i have to say i havent seen it yet as things break down its either going to force us into community or we will kill each other more
513011 the experience of a systems thinker who brings awareness to all their relationships with specific human and non human beings
513012 but human beings know what they want at bottom it may sound trite but across all the divisions of race and ethnicity religion and civilization class caste and rule one thing we all agree on is that we care about our kids we want the best possible future for them and we have a pretty clear conception of what that good future means its not a future full of material stuff but a future in which our children are secure and safe and can develop their potential and flourish as human beings

513027 more usually it is the driver that hits the headlines while we go back to the service park to prepare the pace notes for the next day
513028 the role of the navigator is basically the manager in the car we are responsible for collating all the information together before an event and organising where everyone needs to be and when we can t complain about the fame the drivers get as we are coming into the sport fully aware of the rewards we are going to get

513037 ive seen the final result of the vote for the u s the website vote ended on sunday july 27 and we always sit together the day of the show in the afternoon because we need to let the lighting designer know you have to program the desk for the order of the songs so the crew needs to be informed exactly but we are much more flexible and we have a different situation in the first three shows because we are playing with sammy hagar as a package and that means in california because of the strict curfews and the situation there are three bands i think we dont play as long as we normally do in europe we play like two hours and twenty and here its just like 90 minutes so that automatically changes the set because we have to leave quite a few songs out so we will talk about the set list when we all meet before the first show in a few days
513038 yes yes theres not one song that we dont know some of them like 89 those songs are not so popular and with us theyre not so popular either laughs and therefore we havent played those and if we dont have to play them we wont but everything in the top 50 we know right away also we keep changing the set around you can imagine the votes the results in russia are totally different from the ones in the u s or in spain they vote for different songs than in england or japan
513039 a few but not too many it has to be the right proportion people dont like it if you play too many new songs but we play three or maybe four they americans want to hear the back catalogue the rock you like a hurricane no one like you holiday the zoo and all that and once you do that the first hour is gone

513095 please sit i see that allison has good customer ratings and a lot of revenue good suck ratings and has been praised and given a big tip by roger just now but has never had a trip out of the bar and shes been here for three years she has never been trained for higher responsibility and she appears to be capable of it and doesnt have anything negative in her record do you know why
513096 it may be because shes already a waitress and hasnt asked for privileges or training i usually wait for them to ask at least for a while i agree she has potential
513097 i was called to see mr johnson i was going to have the floor supervisor handcuff me but she said she wouldnt do it
513098 i was curious about you and looked up your records you have a very good record with lots of revenue and good ratings and a nice balance in your personal account however you havent tried to advance and you have never asked for a trip out of the bar i would like to know why
513099 i do ok as a waitress and i dont want to foul up in a different job
513100 i dont see any reason to leave the bar my home town is hundreds of miles away from here and my family sold me into slavery anyway i dont know anyone here outside of the bar staff i have used some of my account money to get a few things i wanted like a tv and books and some of the others helped me order them
513101 when you were promoted to white collar did you mess up
513102 when you were promoted to green collar did you mess up
513103 when you became a waitress and got that yellow collar did you mess up
513104 i got some help in learning the right way to do things
513105 no i think it was because i admitted my problems and asked for help
513106 that is correct now given those three situations what makes you so terrified of trying something else and possibly improving your life
513107 it was a difficult thing getting to be a waitress it was hard enough for me that i am afraid that anything harder would get me so messed up id get snuffed
513108 as i recall the things that you had trouble with were remembering orders and balancing a tray the first we took care of with memory training the second was just experience those are common problems by the way and we expected them the more difficult parts of all your jobs you mastered almost immediately you are smart you could be of much more value to the bar and help yourself i want you to try to advance
513109 good question we have a shortage of good management and supervisory candidates you show promise we would like to use you in more important roles
513110 thats part of it you used the word use im a slave an object that can be used im supposed to do things to improve your profits at almost no benefit to me i havent been all that motivated
513111 you have a point but are missing a great deal its true you are a slave you have no rights on the other hand im a slave and have no rights and i got myself into a really good position i had more bargaining power than you do true but it didnt get me to where i am now i got what i have now by being valuable to the bar you have already gone up three steps since you were brought in as a black collar slave thats because you showed yourself to be valuable true its in the bars best interest to get you in a position where your capabilities are used to the best advantage
513112 however you also get rewards when you do more for the bar you might not think that the improvements have been all that much but compare your life now to how it was as a new black collar slave it is quite an improvement isnt it
513113 it is much better it may help to know that even our black collars live a lot better than a lot of bar slaves and a lot of industrial slaves you havent even taken advantage of some of the benefits your good work has earned you i suspect that you dont think it was fair that you got enslaved
513114 well you did and you have to accept it and get on with things we are offering you a chance for a better life there are rewards for succeeding if you fail all that will happen as long as you tried is that you will go back to being a waitress
513115 to give things a push ill give you an early incentive you are now in training to be a red collar i suspect you already know most of what you need to know when you satisfy joan that you are ready you will get a red collar this afternoon you will go to the department store down the street and buy yourself clothes including at least one nice outfit the bar will split the first 400 of cost with you joan will give you a debit card that you can charge things to and after you return we will deduct your share of the cost from your account you can wear clothes on the trip if you can borrow them just to make things a little more interesting joan cant lend you the clothes you have to find someone else to borrow them from after your buying spree is over you will wear some of your new clothes and take a new bar slave elizabeth to the slave store to get her fitted for a leather helmet she will be serving dinner at my house tomorrow evening and i dont want her recognized at least not at first
513116 you will be there too wearing your new nice outfit a friend of mine and i get together with each other from time to time eat a nice dinner then swap slaves for the night you will be my slave to swap tomorrow
513117 you are giving me a promotion and also sharing me sexually
513118 you sound unhappy about that as i recall when you have been in the fuck room you seemed to enjoy it a lot if you liked that a night with my friend will keep you smiling for a week
513119 thats good you can get started as soon as joan gets you the card
513120 i figured it was enslavement resentment it seems like you have decided that you might as well accept the situation and try to make it better
513121 i suppose you said you had more bargaining power how is that
513122 i volunteered with a well drawn contract to protect me i had my reasons to volunteer how did you get enslaved
513123 my parents were down on their luck factory workers with the bad luck being they drank way to much and were lousy workers i was a good student one day when it looked like they were about to lose the house they sold me out i think it got them three months of mortgage payments but made me miserable i got in contact with my brother after i made white collar and it turns out he managed to save some of my stuff in a friends barn he has sent some of the more personal stuff to me
513124 well they are in your past invite your brother to visit if you like
513125 use this and ill transfer money afterward as mr johnson indicated
513126 i would like to be the swap slave again frankly i think you will like it now either go naked or borrow clothes id ask delia if i were you shes near your size im not sure why he said i couldnt lend you clothes except maybe to show you that there are others that have better lives by the way the first trip out is usually nude you are getting a bonus
513127 ive been told to go do something and that i can dress to do it if i can get someone to lend me some clothes could i borrow some from you
513128 allison needs some help can i have a few minutes to help her out
513129 sure take up to an hour its slow now anyway
513130 my bras wont fit you so youll have to go without
513131 this is the first time in three years that ive worn any clothing
513132 that makes it likely that you will do it more often i figured they were grooming you for higher authority
513133 because you are smart pleasant and efficient you will get more privileges quickly i suspect
513134 out the front door turn right two blocks be back in two hours have fun
513135 its ok go on out joan called me and told me to expect you
513136 ill get a few stock workers to help you carry it back to the bar
513137 i saw your charge card the bar sends its slaves here to get things so i knew whose slave you were its ok all of the women working here are slaves too we like it when we see another slave doing well ill get you the help you need
513138 thank you somehow encouragement from another slave is better than any other
513139 i gave delia her clothes back heres the charge card there was another job i was supposed to do
513140 yes wait here i dont want you sashaying through the bar wearing clothes ill get elizabeth and explain what you are to do
513141 its gone well it seems that a lot of men do like attractive middle aged women to suck them some even say she looks like their wives she has gotten good reviews
513142 excellent check her out to me for a while mr johnson wants her fitted for an accessory for an alternate use for her
513143 you ask a lot of annoying questions for a junior slave if and when you are to get more information it will be given to you ill skip the pussy shocks i should administer but i wont skip the next one got that
513144 allison this is elizabeth take her to the slave store and have them fit a leather helmet on her that exposes only her eyes bring her back with it on so i can examine it they know you are coming and that you have authorization to put the purchase on the bars account so you wont need a charge card leave her handcuffed and keep hold of her leash at least when you are outside if she gives you any trouble call me
513145 the bar is rapid dial number 1 on that phone if she gets out of line she gets a good pussy zap when she gets back here and you get to do it sassing and arguing are getting out of line
513146 the slave store is a block past the department store go ahead and get started and remember that slave management is one of the jobs of a red collar
513147 im from suckers this slave needs to be fitted with a leather helmet that exposes only her eyes
513148 weve been expecting you our fitter is in the work room and ready to start follow me please
513149 welcome have your slave sit in this chair and ill get started
513150 yes much better i will finish the fitting by adding padding to the chin and a little at the back so it is properly snug it will be just a few minutes
513151 that seems good ill glue the pads in with the final adhesive and we can make a final check
513152 this style doesnt have a zipper for the mouth just as they specified when they called it does have zippers to expose the ears so she can hear better in a serving situation
513153 use this loop and the hole in the zipper handle to lock it on if desired is it satisfactory
513154 ill put the bill on the bars tab thank you for your business
513155 very nice this fits the requirements ill take it off and get her back into the suck rotation you get your clothes off and finish your shift
513156 you will be wearing this tomorrow night you will be assisting mr johnsons house slave serving dinner to his guests before you ask yes you will be nude and now back to suck duty youve made a good amount of money today and you have a nice customer satisfaction rating thats good making money and satisfying customers is the way you establish your value and stay alive
513157 here she is let her loose on the cocks of the world
513158 weve had a few requests for her two of the customers are still here ill send her out right away im having delia do some leading and she isnt bad at it i was assuming you wanted her to take on a bigger role
513159 id like a suck allison and i want you to do it
513160 of course sir ill get ready and cuffed and be right back
513161 please no cuffs my late wife did something that i want to have again she would cradle my balls in her hands and caress not squeeze them while she blew me the suckers here are always handcuffed so they cant do that
513162 all you have to do is ask sir i am happy to perform it any way you like do you have any other preferences
513163 for this one instead of the energetic way thats usual around here i would like it slower with you just going up and down over my cock
513164 yes sir a bobber coming up i have to inform the supervisor and ill be right back
513165 it was exquisite just like i asked for come here allison
513166 he asked for me to do it the way his late wife used to do it were supposed to follow the customers requests
513167 he seemed to appreciate it we usually frown on contact after the suck but he was gentle and affectionate so it was ok good job
513168 yeah it was great i wondered if i would get off but she pulled it off
513169 we get a lot of that someone wants a second suck or has just had too much to drink or whose equipment doesnt work very well will order a suck and the poor girl who has to do it is stuck you managed to make it work but sometimes it just doesnt ill mention the effort you made in the comments i put in for the report
513170 was this a normal day will i have days like this all the time it seemed pretty rough
513171 it was a busy day for you people were asking for the new wife slave you got more sucks than you would have in a normal rotation most suckers are young and im not sure whether they will incorporate older suckers into the regular rotation i do know that they are planning on putting some suckers out on display in the bar to see if that sells more sucks and the older suckers will be included in that
513172 you look tired i am supposed to get you showered then take you to the fuck room and get you set up to fuck you can rest until the fucking starts
513173 on top of becoming a slave being chained most of the day and being made to suck cocks im supposed to get raped too
513174 not raped fucked you are a slave and your owner will be using the body he bought and paid for it would be to your advantage to make it enjoyable your life here could be reasonably easy or it could get a lot worse and your attitude and your willingness to do what is expected will make a big difference in whether things are good for you or not
513175 lets go to the white collar shower room i can fasten a long chain to your collar and take off the cuffs and let you shower then help you with your hair youve been shaved so thats not a problem off we go
513176 we have plenty of time kneel and lick me if you make me feel good ill reciprocate
513177 can i get out of these handcuffs to enjoy it
513178 the handcuffs stay on you must remain controlled i could put you in a belt and leather cuffs attached to the belt but that would take time and wouldnt be all that much better than what you have now
513179 yes it was part of my instructions and i am obeying them
513180 were all alone in here you could give me a break
513181 not with those cameras we arent alone you can assume that you are never alone around here im sure that the cameras are off when mr johnson is in here but other than that they are probably on and with you in here probably watched lie on you back and stretch your arms to the corners of the bed i have instructions on the position you are to be in
513182 a shame it can be so much fun this position may seem difficult but your butt hasnt been pulled off the bed and the leg chains are reasonably slack ive enjoyed this situation greatly
513183 will you be in here with us when i get fucked
513184 i dont know he may tell me to stay and he may not
513185 it seems like you are ready for a good fuck
513186 the licking and the rubbing helped george mr johnson said he had always wanted to fuck me and i wanted him to but never told him its funny that it takes being enslaved and made to suck cocks to get it to happen
513187 louise told me you dont like things put into your pussy but you dont seem to be too worried now about mr johnson fucking you
513188 its mainly things other than cocks that bother me even though ive been less fond of cocks in the last few years
513189 well when your owner arrives youll be getting seven inches of good hard thick cock he goes really slow most of the time hes one of those guys that wants to be inside you for a long time

513191 hello delia i see you have her ready help me with my clothes

513197 yes i did two orgasms those were the first from sex with a man in years will you be doing this a lot
513198 probably not with you we get requests from customers to let them have sex with some of our bar slaves and we sometimes rent them out i think you will be getting some of those requests
513199 were not an adult store theres no porn there are no dildos theres no ass lube theres no butt plugs
513200 this is an upscale store its not a black room with one light bulb this is a serious store for a cross dresser or transgendered person
513201 i was hopeful but did i really think any of them would come and meet me and see what they fear no
513202 i happen to have several friends who are transgender so its something that is a very sensitive subject and its very close to my heart
513203 its something that i would never want to make any choices that would insult my friends i also feel like im part of a movement of people that are sort of making it into mainstream society and dont really have a voice yet or are still finding their voice its kind of an honor at first it just sounded like a really fun character to play now it feels a little bit more important

513221 well there is no stoning of women going on in europe so why discuss the subject
513222 teacher this woman was caught in adultery in the very act
513223 now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what do you say
513224 as for the adulteress and the adulterer flog each of them with a hundred stripes and let not compassion with them keep you from this law of god if you believe in god and the last day and let a group of the believers witness their chastisement
513225 the quran is the book by the aid of which the arabs came to europe as kings to hold up the light to humanity while darkness lay around to raise up the wisdom and knowledge of hellas from the dead to teach philosophy medicine astronomy and the golden arts of songs to the west as to the east to stand at the cradle of modern science and make us late comers to weep over the day when granada fell
513226 the quran admittedly occupies an important position among the great religious books of the world though the youngest of the epoch making works belonging to this class of literature it yields to hardly any in the wonderful effect which it has produced on large masses of men it has created an all but a new phase of human thought and a fresh type of character

513232 those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because thye said our sustainer is god this verse is an outstanding example of islam recognizing the places of worship of all religions and asking muslims to give protection from the terrorists
513233 o men behold we have created you all out of a male and a female and have made you into nations and tribes so that you might recognize each other verily the noblest of you in the sight of god is the one who is the most deeply conscious of him behold god is all knowing all wise
513234 behold god has removed from you the arrogance of pagan ignorance jahiliyyah with its boast of ancestral glories man is but a god conscious believer or an unfortunate sinner all people of children of adam and adam was created out of dust
513235 every nation has its distinctive personality reflecting its traditions pretensions and historys caprices and in this regard israel is no different it exists but it is becoming increasingly dangerous to world peace and to itself in the past israeli wars produced victories and more territories now they will produce only disasters
513236 the logic of force merged with an essentially western colonialist bias its founders were europeans and it was an outpost of european culture until the globalization of values and products made these cultural distinctions increasingly irrelevant
513237 in the western world we have tended to view god in a rather anthropomorphic
513238 religion should make some ultimate sense of a flawed and tragic world because religion has an ethical dimension it is a kind of moral aesthetic it is not enough to experience the divine or the transcendent the experience must be incarnated in our behaviour towards others all the great religions insist that the test of true spirituality is practical compassion that is the litmus test of authentic spirituality
513239 the christians of medina were allowed to worship in the mosque an expression of the continuity of the islamic tradition with the gospel
513240 in 1800 jerusalem had about 8750 inhabitants 4000 muslims 2750 christians and 2000jews they all shared a common suq and lived clustered around their principal shrines
513241 apart from the brief interlude of crusade occupation jerusalem had been an important islamic city for nearly thirteen hundred years
513242 it is not surprising that on both sides jewish and palestinians black and white accounts of their struggle have tended to oversimplify the issue presenting it in terms of villains and heroes total right and absolute wrong the will of god or a divine chastisement but the reality is more complex
513243 on the other hand they the israelis have not reached the same high standard as caliph umar and saladin both invited jews to settle in jerusalem when they replaced christian rulers there
513244 one of the inescapable messages of history of israel is that despite romantic myths to the contrary suffering does not necessarily make us better nobler people all too often quite the reverse

513252 the document is regarding land in the territory of arkansas the document is dated november 27 1820 this document was handed down to me from my grandfather he was an avid collector who has donated his civil war collection to the smithsonian institute
513253 the document is in nice condition but has been folded it contains a very dark signature of the president of the united states james monroe it is also countersigned by the commissioner of the general land office josiah meigs i think 60 00 is a fair asking price
513254 these presidential signed land grants were signed prior to 1833 after that date clerks were authorized to sign his name
513255 little or no effort was made to imitate the presidents signatures after secretaries were authorized to sign presidential land grants partway through andrew jacksons administration
513256 the presidents from andrew jackson to theodore roosevelt employed secretaries to counterfeit their signatures on land grants after 1834 no president personally signed such documents
513257 the louisiana purchase set madison and monroe to driving the quill signing tens of thousands of land grants for veterans who wished to settle in the new regions finally andrew jackson rebelled and pout a stop to the presidential stint of signing several hundred papers daily
513258 the rash of presidential proxies really began with old hickory back in 1834 before the era of that doughty soldier all presidents had personally assumed the burden of signing the countless hundreds of routine documents which crossed their desk each week land grants ships papers military appointments

513322 we started moving the ball a little bit and the defense decided to bring full pressure on us so it was a one on one situation with jerricho and he made a great catch i just tried to put it out there and let him go get it
513323 we talked about it earlier in the off season since ive been here hes always thrown the ball well a little tweak here and there couldnt hurt him but just warming up i felt the difference
513324 he went one on one with a safety for us thats a pretty good matchup when youve got dustin keller running down the middle of the field i just threw that to an area and let him go get it and he did a great job im sure that theyre saying it was controversial on the tackle but well take it
513325 i would say that im progressing towards where i want to be
513326 the path to get there has many different signs along the way its still a work in progress but im definitely headed in the direction

513486 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
513487 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
513488 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
513489 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
513490 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
513491 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
513492 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
513493 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
513494 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
513495 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives

513514 before jim was activated during the entire summer of 2004 he had a lot of dental work at the va in tucson arizona he had no symptoms and no one observed lesions in his mouth he was healthy and fit all his life this came up suddenly and just devastated his body quickly
513515 jim did mention the terrible pollutants coming from the smoke stacks and the brown water he washed his clothes in while in theatre i read about depleted uranium and talked with him about it but he never said anything about being exposed to it and i dont think they tested him for it we asked the doctors if agent orange could be the cause and they said there was no way to tell we asked if he had been exposed to something in kuwait and again they couldnt say they did comment frequently on how aggressive his cancer was
513516 when the doctor told him he had six months to live i dont think he believed it he still asked for more treatment
513517 he tried to get stronger and the doctor said well you could try more chemo and die from a heart attack or you could die from the cancer
513518 over 4th of july weekend skin lesions multiplied canvassing his neck back and chest
513519 there were hundreds thousands of lesions circling the upper part of his entire body
513520 his neck and throat was so swollen i pleaded with his doctors to make him more comfortable
513521 it was the first time i had seen him laying still resting so i went back to the fisher house
513522 the next morning i returned to the hospital at the usual time 5 00 am only to see his room door closed
513523 i knew when i saw the door closed something had happened and the nurses asked if i had gotten a phone call and i did not they said he passed away at 4 55 am five minutes before i arrived
513524 so i guess he was comfortable he slipped away in peace remaining in the same position i left him in the night before
513525 jim said he knew where he was going and hed be okay but please pray for dixie
513526 they the aforementioned dont talk to the sick soldiers nobody wanted to hear our story maybe when a wounded soldier dies but not a sick soldier the sick soldiers dont exist i firmly believe that just because they have gotten sick and were not injured they were still over there in iraq and served their country but its not the same in the militarys eyes or in the publics if you werent injured over there but you became sick instead it doesnt seem to count in the game of war

513571 i think all summer long and probably the past three four months ive pushed and pushed and pushed and tried too hard and practiced too hard and worked too hard
513572 ive wanted to play too well too much whereas now im sort of filled out a little bit and just play and enjoy it and see what that brings
513573 im sure youve heard guys say before if you try too hard sometimes it goes the opposite way and thats what ive been doing ive been desperate to play really well and i couldnt quite do it
513574 i actually didnt quite play so well especially on the back nine struggled a little bit
513575 but i hit it close enough and knocked a few putts in not big long things or anything but just holed a few i like this place ive played well here before so pretty enjoyable
513576 i obviously played very well here to win so i know the golf course
513577 its a tough golf course its a tricky tricky golf course today i played really well unfortunately i made bogey on the last but overall im pretty pleased with the way i played
513578 im a long way out of it at the moment and i need to show an excellent form
513579 if i do he may consider me for a pick and if i dont ill be watching it on tv like everybody else im just trying to play as well as i can and well see what happens
513580 those are the facts and thats what i have to do if i do play well if i do start playing well like i did today i think i would be an addition to the team and if i dont play well i would not be i would not expect a pick i just want to play as well as i can and see where it takes me
513581 my whole action improved which is what ive really struggled with all year
513582 its really good to get back onto pure greens again as good as these are and i start rolling in those four or five footers to save par i havent been making those this year and that puts me on the back foot straightaway like anybody because its a very difficult game mentally if youre not doing that
513583 estou muito contente acho que foi a primeira vez na temporada em que meus principais concorrentes levaram azar

513595 there is no direct connection between the digital transition of broadcast television stations that will occur across the nation in early 2009 and cablevisions decision to transition away from the duplicate analog feeds of a certain number of channels that we already carry in digital format neither our customer service training nor our customer communications link the two in any way our customers service representatives speak to thousands of customers on myriad of issues every day and it is certainly possible that someone misspoke and if that is the case we apologize

513634 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
513635 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
513636 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
513637 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
513638 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
513639 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting

513643 im a real down to earth guy thats had a lot of problems in my life since birth

513645 it was loud it was so loud it really made me jump
513646 so we got up to check the power box there was no light out there it was really dark but my partner saw someone slumped against our fence and he told me to go and grab a torch and the phone to ring the police
513647 initially the man was still alive and i told my partner to give him cpr but then he saw the shotgun and the police said to stay away
513648 we didnt realise there was another person who was already dead it was so dark but then one of the police lights shone over her and we saw that there was a lady lying on the ground covered in blood
513649 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing

513652 to qualify for a tick simply by changing the serving size recommendation i think is just not consistent with the principle of the tick i mean you could in an extreme situation say ill have half a piece of this chocolate bar instead of a whole chocolate bar and it meets the tick the pick the tick programme is trying to get manufacturers to reformulate and produce foods that have less salt and less energy and less saturated fat and thats good but in this food product it just doesnt exist
513653 there clearly is a downside when its consumed in too large an amount but its the real world and i think its better that we make the recommendation in a positive way and educate people about the benefits of this product with trim milk as a healthy milk drink
513654 were trying to be responsible in terms of the whole obesity environment
513655 people are going to continue dosing probably at their normal dosage rate and the research shows that is under three teaspoons so if theyre dosing at that rate it shows theyre qualifying for the heart tick

513682 we believe in a jewish majority in jerusalem as such it is the capital of the jewish nation
513683 the israelis tried to take jerusalem out of the political game by using all their power to change the situation and consolidate their rule over the city but they failed
513684 she was born there i dont see why she should change it

513697 hell go through the progressions on pass plays for no 1 2 3 4 and even 5 with kevin hell go to 1 and 2 and if nothings there take the ball down and try to make a play himself
513698 so with nate were trying to maybe get him to hurry it up slightly because if he looks for 5 the pressure might get to him with kevin were trying to get him to be a little more patient and look for 3 but were not trying to change his game sometimes its a good thing to be ready to make a play if the receiver isnt open
513699 ive had some meaningful innings in my life but with the whole situation and for the people back home its bigger than just us this victory id have to say its my best innings
513700 weve all just witnessed a very very special innings the way graeme smith came out and played was as good as ive seen anyone chase down that sort of target under that sort of pressure
513701 i knew we just needed one or two partnership i was focusing on ten runs at a time thinking lets just get close
513702 i felt we were just one wicket away if we could have got the likes of morne morkel and paul harris in on that kind of deck i felt we could have won the game
513703 theyve played better cricket than us over the three games
513704 we are better prepared this time to perform in malaysia and we have deep respect for the culture it is about the music not about sexy we are going to respect the people of this country and the culture
513705 i just have to thank everyone for helping me come so far ive had such an amazing time in asia

513709 thankfully the busboys and wait staff were there to climb up and help the girls down lindsay and sam were laughing hysterically they thought it was the funniest thing ever
513710 now can you do that while you slowly rotate around the bed
513711 i dont know whats going to happen with this thing i really dont
513712 is to make sure theres a marketplace on the web for these people to make money not to build farm teams for another medium
513713 its like we are in california 100 years ago with a movie camera and a tent setting up on the side of a river
513714 its the kind of shoot where you need a permit
513715 one of the great selling points of working for next to nothing is that you can really have an opportunity to bring your vision to the screen without any interference
513716 you are all able to go to the limit to be more extreme in anything you can do than in television or film what i am really interested in is new media whats fun for me is to create stories and do things that have never been done before
513717 i am happy for the children who have an opportunity to experience new trier on a daily basis shouldnt all children have the same opportunity
513718 conservatives arent actually behind technologically were just doing it differently
513719 that was first time anything like that happened to me
513720 and i was really taken aback but now its almost run of the mill
513721 ive seen great blog posts and great articles that get zero comments and some of it is the writing
513722 i also see people try way too hard to get comments i think its nice to engage at every turn but the number of comments you get on a story and blog post isnt everything we have to tell a lot of new bloggers that here they get upset after a month or two that they are only getting a handful of comments a day
513723 one will sign up as a reader and of every 10 only one will comment and of every 10 who do one will become a diarist
513724 for the most part what you do see is people are rising purely on merit or at least on popularity
513725 theyre giving community what the community wants which is different than the outside world
513726 commenters arent just commenters on our site like they are on politico
513727 but on a niche site like tpm muckraker your percentage of good quality comments is quite high
513728 there is very little difference between the content and the comments to this day i get e mails from readers who dont know comments left by someone arent actually the story
513729 nobody would tolerate if at the end of meet the press if a bunch of weirdos stormed the studio and started screaming weird racist stuff
513730 on a site like politico where it is less of a community and more about the media talking and sharing what it knows
513731 you might have a certain kind of commenter who talks back and often yells back and it is very messy sometimes
513732 i dont like when there is racist stuff or other offensive stuff
513733 i think we take that down as a matter of policy when we see it we probably dont do as much as we might to get it down as quickly as possible thats kind of the nature of our start up operation that we always have more holes in the dike than we have thumbs to put there
513734 do you just let some of this up online so people understand that there are a lot of prejudices are out there
513735 it is a struggle for all of us to figure out how much do you permit to permeate the space youve created that is supposed to be respectful but not dominated by the pc police
513736 there are certain obvious things we have certain specific things
513737 conspiracy theories we dont allow conspiracy theories if you thought sept 11 was caused by the bush administration your comment is not going to appear unless it is a mistake
513738 i dont get comfortable censoring speech even if it is offensive and there is no need for me to subject myself to those decisions
513739 im not sure what good hundreds of thousands of comments or message boards do for anybody
513740 i have never known anybody to just read through all of that and think its worth revisiting its our job as editors to find a better solution

513746 my friend bill bridge wanted to start this toy company
513747 and i said no ive been in business before its a lot of work but bill had a lot of clever toy ideas for young kids and he convinced me thats what we wanted to do
513748 i told her they already have balls for blind kids
513749 no you dont understand theyre junk they have electronics in them and they beep and they wont shut off and he pulls the batteries out and chews on them theyre no good
513750 how can it make noise if theres no electronics to emit some sort of a sound
513751 it was like in the movies where nothing worked and i got more and more frustrated
513752 it was like all of a sudden this thing appeared in my mind
513753 i dont know if you want to call it divine inspiration or what but there it was
513754 she looked at me and said do you see what youve done
513755 i started tearing up and had to leave the room ive designed a lot of things in my life but watching that was life changing for me
513756 everybody in the toy business told us to stay out of special needs
513757 they said its a very limited market its very expensive to produce toys that are certified for use by special needs people youre not going to make any money youll go broke
513758 my mothers deaf and i know how to sign but we cannot get into special needs you cant make any money at it
513759 we asked what we should change and what we should add and they gave us changes
513760 so before we went into production it had all that in it
513761 all kids like to play with these balls we had bills kids and other kids that came in and they all loved it
513762 what we found out was almost anything that would stimulate mental activity or stimulate movement or attention or anything like that with a child with special needs also works with any other infant
513763 thats how we all learn we learn by touching feeling and so forth
513764 i just thought maybe if you do the right thing things will turn out well for you
513765 thats what my dad always taught me just do the right thing

513910 currently our society is a linear construction of opposites that do not exist in nature they are purely perceptual within human minds good evil profit loss popular unpopular
513911 having discussed the modes of thought through which an individual passes in being a nihilist it is now appropriate to use the dreaded
513912 the best thinkers in all doctrines have reached this state of mind
513913 close loopholes that have allowed employers to avoid responsibility for discriminatory pay
513914 improve outreach and training efforts to work with employers in order to eliminate pay disparities
513915 creates a new grant program to help strengthen the negotiation skills of girls and women
513916 is hitting women harder than men they are suffering more job losses and larger reductions in wages than the general population

513918 it was rothbard who put all these pieces together into a unified system that seems implausible at first but inevitable once it has been defined and defended
513919 were finding there are pretty substantial oil reserves in the world
513920 new exploration and drilling technologies are making major new discoveries possible
513921 with the white tiger field in vietnam 90 of the production is coming from basement rock where there were never any fossils
513922 what theyve been teaching us in school about oil coming from fossils is wrong
513923 if you drill deeper into basement rock youre probably going to find some hydrocarbons but the chance of finding giant fields is pretty small
513924 the u s petroleum geological community has a viewpoint firmly opposed to the notion of oil being of nonbiological origin but not the russian chinese or vietnamese
513925 the u s has ignored completely the obviously very important swedish results
513926 in the aftermath of a series of pullouts by western oil majors vietnam has gone into partnership with its former cold war ally russia to develop its oil industry
513927 concentrated in fractured granite basement that is unique in the world oil and gas production practice
513928 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds

513971 we started the morning with two little jabs wont it be strange when we stop splitting cabs
513972 i think its great to get as high as that
513973 at the beginning of the year a lot of people were asking me if my new setup after splitting with
513974 i think my results showed that it took a little bit of time but that its paying off and im enjoying myself much more on court

513976 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
513977 hes obviously got a great serve but ive read it well in the past today i did the same
513978 youve still got to come up with passes because he volleys well
513979 i hit some great lobs and passing shots which is why i managed to break him so many times four
513980 absolutely none but i am not scoring runs as a number three batsmen i have got to score runs and in this series what have i got
513981 i have had some good balls a little bit of bad luck but i set myself a lot of high standards and in this series i have not got anywhere near those standards so i want to look at that and make sure i get back to playing like i can
513982 let the dust settle because emotions always run high after defeats like this its the first time i have ever lost back to back games and i am more gutted than anyone because midway through the day i expected us to bowl them out for 200 and win quite comfortably
513983 let the dust settle from today and try to work out where we are
513984 we are not playing the level of cricket which i would like i cant fault any of the efforts from any of the players they are giving it absolutely everything but we are just not playing well enough as a unit or as well as we can and that has to be looked at

514269 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
514270 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
514271 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
514272 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great

514332 rtb model research increasingly will confirm that very little of the genomes contains useless or junk dna that is dna that serves no purpose for the organism
514333 naturalism research increasingly will show that genomes are filled with dna portions that serve no purpose and that the more advanced the species and later it appears the more junk its genome contains
514334 used to be called junk dna but few biologists are willing to call it that anymore what they have in common other than that they are never translated into proteins is that they regulate the activity of genes that do carry instructions to make proteins

514345 i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
514346 it is amazing how fast things happen in life most things are beyond our understanding of why they even happen we must put our trust in our faith at certain points in our lives and just pray we have made the right choice so when an opportunity arises even though you can not yet comprehend what lies beyond the choice is it best to go the safer route and always wonder what could have happened or is it better to go the more risky route to follow the whispers of spirits risk heart ache and pain for all that could have been

514352 wed had problems over the last ten years but you know i thought that when you put your hand on the bible you know until death do us part and for better or worse i thought people really meant that when they said it
514353 this is a simple divorce theres no custody theres just a big pile of junk that weve accumulated we should split it however the judge wants it and walk away but you know my wifes lawyer has told different magazines theres gonna be a war
514354 this is the money that i saved for my family and money that linda could walk away with money that i saved for my children that theyre just theyre just wasting it and burning it up

514526 we hope that catholics around the state will recognize the moral and civic duty they have as catholics and citizens to vote and to do so with a properly formed conscience
514527 if we as catholics want to effect change in our society and culture we must vote and encourage our friends and family to do the same
514528 the catholic church certainly understands and also believes in the separation of church and state
514529 but that doesnt mean we believe in the separation of faith and politics
514530 faith is what drives the thinking of catholics of christians in terms of their relationship with god and also in terms of their relationship with their neighbor
514531 because of that our political relationships which are about our relationship with our neighbor are informed by our faith so serious catholics whether politicians or ordinary voters have an obligation actually to make sure that faith informs their political decisions and their actions
514532 we catholics are not one issue voters but neither do we catholics believe that every issue is of the same moral weight or value
514533 all of the many issues and rights about which we are so rightfully concerned are grounded in that fundamental right which our declaration of independence calls unalienable and that is the right to life
514534 danseparc is an impressive attempt to put full fledged philosophical concepts into a popular music form and a giant step forward for the band that has continually proved itself one of the most forward thinking in canadian pop music
514535 danseparc is simply one of the most satisfying albums of the year from the evocative vaseline lens treatment of the title cut to walking into walls classic 80s dialogue to johnsons wry commentary on what people do for fun the group addresses rarely mined contemporary topics with disarming precision and unassailable musicality
514536 every once in a while an album is released that is void of pretense sparked with an effervescent originality injected with real power true emotion and sarcastic intelligence bursting at its seams with thumping atomic energy danseparc is such an album

514541 submerged is an exploration the water based series draws on contrasting elements and environments to explore perspective light angle space and emotion this particular collection from the series strips the image down to a simple basic state soft reflections and flowing lines invite the viewer to explore the environment their connection with the subject and to draw personal parallels the images evoke feelings of detachment and surrender subjects hang suspended there is a sense of serenity as they accept the moment and release at a basic level the images explore a spectrum of emotions as tones of euphoria optimism eroticism and sorrow wash away leaving the subject vulnerable and at peace

514550 heavy meat eaters claim that they eat meat because it tastes better than other foods such as meat substitutes our results challenge that claim participants who ate the vegetarian alternative did not rate the taste and aroma less favorably than those who ate the beef product instead what influenced taste evaluation was what they thought they had eaten and whether that food symbolized values that they personally supported strategies that might persuade heavy meat eaters to change their diet include changing the cultural associations of fruits and vegetables to encompass values that meat eaters endorse e g power and strength or challenging heavy meat eaters assumptions about what tastes good by using in store blind taste tests or showing them results of studies such as this one

514587 we are pleased to continue our ongoing discussion with canadian farmers and to have an opportunity to showcase how our producers will benefit from the green shift
514588 the purpose of the green shift is to move canada towards a green economy
514589 there are benefits for everyone and we believe that agriculture will be a winner in the green economy
514590 the green shift is about transitioning towards sustainable renewable markets that will increase demand and open new opportunities for canadian farmers
514591 what farmers are facing as a result of the green shift is a considerable increase in input costs whether its a result of fuel that farmers use or even as a result of how much their input costs may go up as a result of this carbon tax
514592 what were basically saying is look agriculture already provides a lot of carbon sequestration farmers have done all kinds of things to create more carbon sinks were saying look theres got to be some calculations here that agriculture provides this theyre the solution providers so why tax them

514600 no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and i will raise him up at the last day
514601 for you see your calling brethren that not many wise according to the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called
514602 woe to you chorazin woe to you bethsaida for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes but i say to you it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon in the day of judgment than for you
514603 and you capernaum who are exalted to heaven will be brought down to hades for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day but i say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment than for you
514604 and he will destroy on this mountain the surface of the covering cast over all people and the veil that is spread over all nations he will swallow up death forever and the lord god will wipe away tears from all faces the rebuke of his people he will take away from all the earth for the lord has spoken
514605 he laid hold of the dragon that serpent of old who is the devil and satan and bound him for a thousand years and he cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal on him so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished but after these things he must be released for a little while
514606 blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection over such the second death has no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years
514607 but the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished
514608 then i saw a great white throne and him who sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great standing before god and books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged according to their works by the things which were written in the books
514609 only those who are written in the lambs book of life
514610 judged according to their works by the things which are written in the books
514611 grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ
514612 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god to salvation for everyone who believes for the jew first and also for the greek
514613 surely i will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live
514614 i will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live then you shall know that i am the lord
514615 son of man these bones are the whole house of israel
514616 our bones are dry our hope is lost and we ourselves are cut off
514617 behold o my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up from your graves and bring you into the land of israel then you shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves o my people and brought you up from your graves i will put my spirit in you and you shall live and i will place you in your own land then you shall know that i the lord have spoken it and performed it
514618 come on back to church george everyone still likes you and you might even enjoy some of pastor borings sermons
514619 i dont want to go back and fellowship with all of those hypocrites
514620 now if anyone does not have the spirit of christ he is not his
514621 he who says i know him and does not keep his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him
514622 why do you call me lord lord and do not do the things which i say
514623 you have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i say to you love your enemies bless those who curse you do good to those who hate you and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you
514624 but god was not there no father there is no good
514625 so when this corruptible has put on incorruption and this mortal has put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is your sting o hades where is your victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ
514626 for god has committed them all to disobedience that he might have mercy on all oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who has known the mind of the lord or who has become his counselor or who has first given to him and it shall be repaid to him for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen

514639 his attorneys in open court said he believes there was a coverup by the sheriff
514640 defendant caronas public persona which helped him get elected and remain in office was quite different from who he was in his attempts to further the conspiracy
514641 this is another sign that we are moving into the future of this department and not looking back

514647 today is a sunny day both in the sky and for orange county law enforcement

514652 the lack of integrity manifested by her misconduct compounded by her lack of candor in response to the commissions investigation and deceitful testimony under oath compels our conclusion that removal is necessary to protect the public and maintain public trust in the integrity of the judiciary
514653 however we are concerned that the traits and lack of judgment that led to the misconduct in this case could lead to future improper actions demeaning to the esteem of the judiciary
514654 this is a risk we cannot run and still fulfill our responsibility to protect the public and the reputation of the judiciary

514705 en una decision de dar institucionalidad y democracia decid enviar al poder ejercutivo esto que habia sido objeto de controversia controversial porque afectaba intereses de sectores comerciales
514706 la autocritica es cierto grado de ingenuidad ante la reaccion de estos sectores exportadores que son los beneficiados y no los peque os y medianos productores
514707 hay q desdramatizar y cada uno es responsable de las decisiones politicas que toma cada uno evalua y no me corresponde analizar la decision del vicepresidente
514708 volver a a hacer todas las cosas que igualmente hice en los dias que van de gobierno fue la primera vez que tuvimos la oportunidad de discutir como se redistribuyen rentas excepcionales
514709 son discusiones que hay que despojarlas de un sesgo ideol gico y dogm tico cuando se adjetiva demasiado es que no se quiere abordar el n cleo verdadero de la cuestion
514710 porque satanizar funcionarios un secretario de comerio no define el causante de tal o cual problema lo importante de un funcionario es si se desempe a en forma correcta y honestamente
514711 normalmente los sistemas de medicion siempre presentan dudas en todos los pa ses como en los estados unidos el tema del indec fue manejado politica y mediaticamente pero no quiero cargar las tintas
514712 la argentina es mirada como ejemplo en todo el mundo por el respeto a los derechos humanos

514718 se orden hoy la revisi n f sica de las 300 personas detenidas con pulsera
514719 en el caso de fern ndez la informaci n en un primer momento fue que la pulsera hab a registrado solamente dos movimientos uno que fue el traslado a un juzgado y la otra un intento de fuga del detenido sin embargo a las 23 de ayer descubrimos que el ltimo 24 de julio hubo una falta de contacto se sali de la piel la pulsera y eso no fue informado por el responsable t cnico
514720 no est de acuerdo con el arresto domiciliario de personas que hayan cometido delitos graves
514721 sistema es en cuestiones puramente humanitarias como mujeres embarazadas con ni os en causas que no son graves y en ancianos y enfermos terminales lo que amerita el arresto domiciliario
514722 una persona con una condena de violaci n seguida de homicidio que goce de arresto domiciliario es muy criticable tiene que estar dirigido a otro tipo de persona
514723 en forma conjunta no aceptaremos m s intentos de disgregaci n
514724 unidos hemos comenzado esta lucha y pese a quien le pese unidos la terminaremos
514725 el campo est unido y esta realidad esta aqu para quedarse
514726 a la se ora presidenta cristina fern ndez la argentina se va a recuperar con el campo nunca sin el campo y menos contra el campo
514727 las pol ticas de control de precios y de subsidios al consumo no solo volvieron a demostrar su ineficacia sin beneficiar al consumidor sino que adem s ahuyentaron la posibilidad de inversi n
514728 la mara a de normativas y regulaciones que se implementan arbitrariamente y a diario desde comercio la aduana y la oncca
514729 las facultades que el gobierno le ha otorgado al presidente de la oncca son excesivas y se est n utilizando en forma abusiva y discrecional
514730 adem s de las retenciones que contin an siendo confiscatorias las restricciones tales como los registros de exportaci n los plazos de embarques los precios ndices entre otros impiden el normal desenvolvimiento del sector de comercio exterior
514731 el campo contribuy en los ltimos meses a devolverle el protagonismo a las instituciones fundamentales de la rep blica
514732 integrantes de la comisi n de enlace con quienes hemos compartido esta gesta del campo y del pueblo argentino contra la arbitrariedad y la injusticia
514733 mucho se ha dicho sobre las diferencias entre las cuatro entidades
514734 hemos superado con la unidad a quienes buscaban nuestra divisi n
514735 cuando se ofende al campo se ofende al pueblo y cuando se ataca al campo se ataca a la argentina
514736 queremos que los gobernantes sepan que el campo forma parte del pa s y nunca m s ser furg n de cola en las decisiones que comprometan su integridad y su destino
514737 acudimos cada vez que se nos convoc desde el gobierno y lo seguiremos haciendo seguiremos asistiendo en forma conjunta no aceptaremos m s intentos de disgregaci n
514738 en la comisi n de enlace estamos abiertos al di logo franco y profundo
514739 un buen primer paso ser a promover la eliminaci n de las retenciones a todos los productos de las econom as regionales
514740 los peque os productores y especialmente los que est n alejados de los grandes centros de consumo no resisten los derechos de exportaci n ni los altos costos del transporte
514741 contamos para ello con el apoyo con un organismo de primer nivel como el inta para este proyecto que hoy inexplicablemente no nos ha acompa ado
514742 en los ltimos ha ido creciendo lo que pagamos de ingresos brutos pero sin embrago los que tienen grandes extensiones de tierra pagan lo mismo que hace 15 a os
514743 schiaretti anunci el lunes el recorte a los jubilados pero el mi rcoles de la semana anterior eximi a las concesionarias de impuestos
514744 c mo se entiende que un gobierno que dice que no tiene fondos subsidia a las grandes corporaciones
514745 lo que hay que discutir es el d ficit real porque la provincia hace a os no da n meros ni cifras no hay balances disponibles
514746 siguen defendiendo la informalidad en el campo y los mecanismos de elusi n fiscal
514747 el escenario que genera la crisis mundial de alimentos puede y debe ser aprovechado por nuestro pa s pero las oportunidades de los sectores concentrados no pueden excluir al resto de los argentinos y condicionar nuestra seguridad alimentaria
514748 un sector hist ricamente privilegiado como el que representa luciano miguens deber a hacer un esfuerzo para tener m s apego a las reglas minimizar su fervorosa construcci n de pol ticas de concentraci n econ mica y embarcarse en competir en un mercado algo m s transparente
514749 la sociedad rural acot no est para sacar y nombrar a los funcionarios de agricultura tampoco para dictar las pol ticas agropecuarias como hicieron en otros tiempos como dice miguens esas s eran pol ticas arbitrarias
514750 los argentinos hoy tenemos un gobierno que gobierna un gobierno que mantiene una visi n de desarrollo productivo integral y distribuci n de la riqueza que deja de lado el ego smo un gobierno que pone rumbo hacia una pol tica agropecuaria para todos los argentinos y no para un sector en particular
514751 una vez m s desde la sociedad rural se insiste en la voracidad de los grandes productores que s lo buscan exportar a toda costa sin ning n control del estado porque no les importa el abastecimiento interno
514752 tampoco quieren hacerse cargo de la crisis alimentaria mundial y de la mesa de los argentinos lo nico que les importa es la oportunidad de obtener ganancias a costa del hambre de los que no pueden pagar lo que ellos desean ganar
514753 deben saber los ruralistas de palermo que mientras m s produzcan y m s declaren m s exportar n
514754 no pueden expresarse a medias tintas la dirigencia de palermo confunde el cumplimiento de reglas con trabas controles con pol ticas arbitrarias siguen defendiendo la informalidad en el campo y los mecanismos de elusi n fiscal
514755 ya es hora de que la sociedad rural indic deje de apoyarse en las leyes que dise mart nez de hoz para salvaguardar la especulaci n de las grandes exportadoras de cereales cuestionan la resoluci n 543 de la oncca porque ha sido la nica herramienta efectiva con la que pudimos r pidamente combatir la elusi n fiscal que la ley de granos les permite
514756 es hora de cambios y los ruralistas de palermo deben comprender que el pago de los derechos de exportaci n ya no puede ser un componente m s de la especulaci n en el comercio de granos cereales y oleaginosas una cosa son los mercados a futuro y otra cosa es un estado pavo que mira como los exportadores eluden las retenciones
514757 necesitamos un comercio m s transparente en beneficio de todos y no para picard a de unos pocos todas las exportaciones tributan sobre el precio y al nivel de retenciones que est vigente al momento de registrar las operaciones en la aduana si quieren congelar el precio y el nivel de retenciones al tiempo que presentan los roe verde pues entonces que cumplan con sus obligaciones fiscales en ese momento
514758 necesitamos un mercado de granos transparente l stima que los ruralistas de palermo no tienen en cuenta qu algunos de sus socios exportaron en 2007 el 90 por ciento de su producci n a para sos fiscales como m naco islas v rgenes e islas caim n
514759 sin embargo el estado cumple con su deber la aduana estableci que el 86 por ciento del aceite de soja a granel tambi n fue facturado a para sos fiscales y el 80 por ciento de las exportaciones de harina de soja tuvieron estos mismos destinos
514760 la oncca es un engranaje dentro de la estructura fiscalizadora del estado la sociedad rural no deber a molestarle que esta oficina la aduana o la afip hagan su trabajo en la b squeda de la equidad y la transparencia comercial agropecuaria
514761 and b the first question you are invariably asked by any mommy you meet at the park is
514762 in fact you were so proud of this fact that actually said it in more of a lyrically taunting way like
514763 which you began accompanying by holding up paradoxically enough your single pointer finger
514764 i think you need to be five years old before you start playing tee ball on a team
514765 before giving a knowing look at me as if to remind me that i ought to get your ass to the dugout pronto you know when most girls lie about their age they usually opt for a
514766 did you just sit around in the dark all day doing nothing
514767 you answered at which point i threw a stuffed animal at you
514768 we didnt let him take the hat still indiana jones is harrison ford
514769 i have a friend close to the crossing over production and he says kramer has been battling darth weinstein for months over the cut the film has always tested well above average but harvey keeps cutting away at it and removing any kind of disturbing content mostly in the sex scenes between ray liotta and alice eve liotta is an immigration agent and hes blackmailing alice eve who is an actress from australia into having sex with him for a green card harvey objected to the explicit tone of the scenes and apparently the preview audiences singled them out as well so harvey has cut most of it out of the film kramers position was that the scenes were supposed to make people feel uncomfortable because its a sleazy situation but things take a different turn later in the film and we need the earlier tough content to set it up kramers also pissed off that harvey restructured his film and took his bookend device with sean penn and stuck it in the body of the film which he doesnt think makes any sense i know he recently tested his preview version against harveys and harvey won by quite a few points the big reason was again the sex scenes now i have seen only kramers version from a few months ago and i dont think the sex scenes are any big deal they certainly serve the film to lose them would definitely hurt the story theyre not even close to being as raunchy as the cooler i also think the opening with sean penn works great its an exciting opening and when all is revealed at the end then it makes a lot of sense i dont know how putting penn later in the film wiill effect it doesnt seem the right way to go because of all the different storylines harrison ford is excellent in the film and the actor who really shines is cliff curtis who plays his partner jim sturgess has some great scenes as well especially his immigration interview which will go down as one of the classic scenes of 2008
514770 how to work with the local communities so we can preserve some of the areas in which the tigers live
514771 the class soc 121 015 will be offered on thursdays from 12 30 to 3 15 p m and will introduce students to the science of sociology utilizing examples from the real world of society and the reel worlds of george lucas and steven spielbergs films sociological theories and research and their application to culture socialization religion technology inequality and media are the themes of the class films such as thx 1138 american graffiti star wars indiana jones schindlers list amistad and e t will be used as examples of the themes and the fans of star wars and indiana jones will be discussed the class will have an entire section of lectures devoted to the sociological meanings of john williams music students will present a paper about the sociological themes of the films and music and what those films illuminate about the 1970s to 2000s zeitgeist
514772 for everybody in this county who enjoys a view of the ocean were seeing right under our nose the incredible loss of wealth and vitality
514773 the way were going eventually all the oceans are going to be dead
514774 the site was borne out of frustration at the number of tv and press polls based on very little research or the opinions of a few journalists so now i want to give the people a chance to have their say and vote for their favourite films albums and books to create a truly definitive global poll we have had over 4 000 people sign up and vote in the first month and we are already working on a tv show format and a poll the people top rated retail sticker initiative in addition we have had features in the times and the guardian as well as trade press so we have had a great start it s important to us that we reach out to fans of all great artists actors bands so the poll becomes truly definitive
514775 there is no series of films that i have done that have the same spirit and are so if you will shamelessly made for the audience not to pander to them but to give them an exciting ride
514776 it seems to happen on every movie every indiana jones movie we do there is this magic moment when harrison appears on the set in his outfit and puts his hat on that just transports everyone into a magic place i dont know why even in star wars we dont have an iconic figure who does the same
514777 the ryan films the tom clancy films were i thought worth re exploring again but i wasnt a huge fan of the book on which the last one was based i think they made a cracking good shot at it and i think ben affleck is very very talented
514778 thats a character that i think you could revisit acknowledging the passage of time and his increasing age it wasnt age dependent that character and his experiences were chockablock full of recipes for good engaging movies so thats a character i wouldnt mind revisiting
514779 mace neufeld who produces the series is the one gunning for harrison to return to the role but paramount arent interested they still think a younger face is the way to go mace pesters them every few months about giving the role back to ford lorenzo di bonaventura paramount based producer is also open to the idea but the studio dont want it
514780 on balance i suppose im not well known for comedies but i enjoy doing comedies i think comedys a question of creating a character that has both the limitations and the qualities that cause him to be more comic than that character might otherwise be in the same story told without comic intention and then you do of course a certain amount of shtick to help make it clear thats what the intention is i dont know that i can pronounce all the comedy rules but i think i know it when i see it
514781 this is the first piece of finished artwork i did for the fourth indy i did it at the request of george lucas while it was never used in the advertising campaign you may recognize pieces of it that were imposed upon the advance poster
514782 your work in this film is an insult to the soviet and russian people who remember the difficult fifties when our country was concluding its reconstruction after the great war but did not send merciless terrorists to the usa
514783 you have no future in russia any more speaking plainly it is better for you not to come here you will be beaten and despised
514784 our moviegoers are teenagers who are unaware of what happened in 1957 they will go to the cinema and will be sure that in 1957 we made trouble for the united states and almost started a nuclear war its rubbish
514785 it is a load of old nonsense of course but the journey is worth the price of admission
514786 spielberg clearly got enormous pleasure employing a lifetimes worth of skill and turning out wave after wave of smartly done stunts and effects set pieces
514787 director steven spielberg and star harrison ford have no trouble getting back into the groove with a story and style very much in keeping with what has made the series so perennially popular
514788 the magic is still there only you have to work a little harder to make yourself believe this time
514789 theres joy and a middle aged playfulness to the best of steven spielbergs unlikely sequel and i mean that as a full compliment
514790 the eagerly awaited fourth chapter is not a great film by any standard but mixing conventions of all 1950s genres sci fi adventure and even horror and spy it delivers the goods to the fans in a mass spectacle package thats a good old fashioned fun
514791 a lot of the picture veers uneasily between solemnity and slapstick and 47 different genres indiana jones lets be honest never was a memorable movie character he was however a sturdy vessel for our nostalgia and for spielbergs ability to shine up old serialized goods
514792 despite the genuine excitement and one blinding flash of the old genius this new indy film looks like its going through the motions
514793 indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull gets swamped in a sea of stunts and cgi that are relentless as the scenes and character relationships are charmless
514794 between a series of stunt driven set pieces implausibly linked the film gets bogged down in wearying talk
514795 for almost 20 years hollywood has been waiting for the next instalment in the money spinning indiana jones adventure series indy is back this week and even an ageing harrison ford can still crack an impressive box office whip the worldwide opening on thursday of indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull the fourth instalment in the series featuring the worlds most indestructible archeologist has been accompanied by enough controversy and intrigue to merit a film of its own disagreements among producers arguments between screen writers and actors and lawsuits against anyone who has dared to reveal a smidgen of plot have combined to make the usd 185m gbp 95m film one of the most eagerly anticipated of the year directed by steven spielberg and produced by george lucas of the equally spectacular star wars series the film returns to 1957 the height of the cold war for another round of heart pounding chases through tunnels and across clifftops as a motley gang of intrepid treasure hunters span the globe in their quest for the usual nonsense the long delay between the new adventure and the previous instalment released in 1989 and unwisely entitled indiana jones and the last crusade has piqued hollywoods interest in the internet video game age when most recent action blockbusters have been derived from superhero cartoons can an ageing screen idol who hasnt had a decent hit for years reprise the wild success of his youth the good news for ford fans is that indy may be older and greyer but theres still a spark to his repartee spoiler removed whether fords charm will be enough to earn the film the usd 400m it is estimated to need to recoup paramount pictures investment remains to be seen however a preview attended by the sunday times last week suggested that the internet gossips who have doubted the films drawing power may be proved wrong jones admits early on that chasing baddies is not as easy as it used to be in one scene spoiler removed it rapidly becomes clear that since we last saw him saving the holy grail from the nazis jones has spoiler removed much has been made in internet chatrooms about labeoufs potential impact on the film and fears that he is merely a sop to lure teen viewers yet labeouf who made a striking impact against computerised villains in transformers matches ford quip for quip and leather jacket for leather jacket the first indiana jones film in 1981 was spielbergs homage to the saturday morning cliff hanger serials of the 1930s the latest film still has a pleasingly old fashioned feel with several long slow shots plastic like foliage tinny sound effects and spoiler removed cate blanchett makes an eye catching appearance as irina spalko the spooky leader of the russain villainry john hurt spoiler removed the crystal skull itself was formerly the subject of obscure disagreement between spielberg and ford but its now hard to see what the fuss was about spoiler removed the real pleasure for series fans may lie not so much in the madcap action spoiler removed the new film has long appeared critic proof audiences will flock to it whatever the critical verdict yet will it have the box office legs to join its distinguished predecessors among the most popular films in hollywood history it is bound to triumph this weekend the memorial day holiday in america but the latest narnia adventure prince caspian is waiting in the wings and the late heath ledger will soon make a posthumous return to screens in the batman film the dark knight indy may have his work cut out to save the day for spielberg
514796 way back in nov 2007 you posted a blurb entitled indy artwork artist nekokaiju hired by lucas licencing
514797 is that people cant imagine indiana jones aging at all why expect any character to be frozen in time the appeal of indiana jones isnt his youth but his imagination his resourcefulness
514798 his physicality is a big part of it especially the way he gets out of tight situations but its not all hitting people and falling from high places my ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntmans head i hope to continue that no matter how old i get
514799 he sounds nothing like his adventuresome character or like anyone hes played onscreen his voice is pitched much lower and hes not emphatic in his delivery at all theres not a trace of hurry in his cadences it underscores the fact that every detail of what ford does as indy is a careful invention the actor now 65 is guarded almost prickly in speaking of his work he seems to have a horror of being perceived as even remotely conceited which he isnt
514800 we learn more about him through plot devices and well learn something more about him in this film i think its required if youre going to bring back a character youll have to supply the audience with something more and different the adventure is very very important but its interesting to discover a facet of the character that perhaps you hadnt explored before
514801 free airplane rides are just part of the flight rally

514804 each young eagle flight is an opportunity to excite kids by sharing a passion for flight show them that they can participate in aviation at any level
514805 harrison is a boy he was an absolute ball he can hit that dot on the door about 20ft away with his whip he can drive the car like a stuntman and he can act hes basically a cowboy
514806 i wouldnt have done this film for a bit part
514807 i said to spielberg i dont want to just be along for the ride i want to bring something to it im too old in the tooth to just show my face im never going to be a big hollywood star but if im going to be in an indiana jones movie i want to be a big part of the story

514809 we have never before been able to directly measure new infections in the u s on a national level

514811 the bottom line is that the hiv epidemic in the u s continues to spread and at a rate greater than was previously thought
514812 the establishment of a comprehensive and accountable national aids strategy that will eliminate barriers to effective prevention generate adequate resources and hold our government accountable for ending this epidemic

514819 if the hardest part of writing is just making yourself sit there and write and what used to be a typewriter and a blank sheet of paper has been transformed into a magical portal to a zillion fascinating destinations then the internet can be a giant and addictive distraction

514834 many of us have heard stories about chinas gulags but when you discover how close some of these hellholes are to olympic venues its sickening
514835 we hope this guide will draw international attention to the innocent individuals held at these locations
514836 it should particularly aid journalists in investigating the plight of adherents of the falun gong who make up a huge percentage of labor camp detainees and have suffered a brutal campaign of persecution for nine years

514850 it was a good kick but when you hit the ball put your foot here
514851 hey the latter penalty you had a lot of monitoring and did the coup
514852 which was a good try but when you hit the ball you need to kick through the ball youre stopping short
514853 whether you are working with children from adults they will respond to this kind of encouragement
514854 keyboards pointing devices or working surfaces that are too high or too low can lead to awkward wrist arm and shoulder postures for example when keyboards are too low you may type with your wrists bent up and when keyboards are too high you may need to
514855 a generic term used to describe a person with various skills in home improvement some handy people are able to perform anything from minor to major home repairs or even build an entire house the latter is the least common among handy people and usually people expect services such as in handyman kitchen painting minor plumbing minor electrical furniture assembly bathroom handyman and other kinds of home repair
514856 we were served with a search warrant and we complied with the search warrant we didnt have a choice whether we thought the information was relevant or not
514857 the losses for the financial system from people walking away could be of the order of one trillion dollars when the entire capital of the us banking system is only 1 3 trillion
514858 you could have most of the us banking system wiped out so this is a total disaster
514859 what the hell am i supposed to do with it between now and then
514860 if you are worried about spending it between now and then just put it in a term deposit
514861 we started with a clean sheet of paper and told ourselves that we needed to design technology perfectly suited for the rural environment
514862 giving the next administration the tools it will need to start putting public health and especially the health of our children first
514863 it was a very good week for the american public
514864 its stunning democrats would claim to have a great week after failing to vote on let alone pass an energy plan on the no 1 issue facing most americans gas prices the democrats in congress have failed to deliver any relief
514865 the safety commission failed to protect children against dangerous levels of lead in toys and it did nothing to stop the use of dangerous chemicals in plastic toys
514866 one of the things i like about this generation is we are still very early and theres still a lot of room for growth as we move down those price curves
514867 those engines have a lot of steam left in them we think it could be seven or eight years before new machines start to roll out
514868 the worst case is microsoft sony and nintendo all pick a different interface
514869 thats because you have to program so differently for the different architectures if we end up with a diverse set of gpus graphics processing units it would make life difficult
514870 no one has done the comparative programming to determine if one of these is better than the other if nothing else well have games that are better than they are now but radical shifts its too early to tell
514871 as far as next generation is concerned i think one of the distinct advantages that we have is we dont have to go in a specific direction
514872 i dont think the fact that we have a high end machine keeps us from doing bite sized casual entertainment i dont think were relegated to pc shooters or youth oriented casual games we can span the gamut
514873 we are under development but the hardware is a kind of box that consumers reluctantly buy in order to play our games
514874 this time around it happened to be we had a revolutionary user interface will it be the same for the next generation i really cant tell
514875 its natural for the current customer to expect nintendo is going to once again do something different
514876 if the people are expecting so many different things from nintendo its going to be difficult for us to go beyond that expectation again
514877 the use of the parasol for photo aging protection is very common among women there
514878 the kids dont want sales but thats where the jobs are
514879 they need to understand its all about butts in seats
514880 they want to see that you wont wilt like a flower
514881 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
514882 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
514883 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
514884 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
514885 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
514886 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
514887 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
514888 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
514889 theres been a lot of recycling programs where you can mail back goods
514890 but nobodys going to mail back a television most of them are way too big
514891 because they lg dont even have a drop off site in every state although they say they will by september and the same with sony its modest as far as how many places are available for take backs but theyve clearly stated an intent to grow the number and make it easy for people to find nearby locations
514892 tell us that they will be managing the take backs in a responsible way
514893 are driving people to get rid of their older units even if they work
514894 even though there are a number of toxic materials in conventional tvs and computer monitors in a lot of states its not illegal to toss them in the trash
514895 its time manufacturers start to internalize the cost of recycling of their products
514896 this is a major milestone we can share with our sport and broadcast partners who worked closely with us to develop a balanced games schedule that satisfies the respective international sport federations ifs television audiences around the world and spectators who will attend the games said cathy priestner allinger vanocs executive vice president sport and games operations
514897 as with all games the schedule will maintain a degree of flexibility in timing she said
514898 we have to have contingency plans in place for something like this and also for a number of other what ifs that might happen she said vanoc did not elaborate
514899 we owe them the gratitude the appreciation for telling us just get the work done stop the talk and walk the walk get the harbour cleaned up and let us enjoy what we used to be able to enjoy
514900 ive had no issues no skin issues any issues whatsoever so if i can do it anybody can do it

514924 bei gutem wetter sind die leute einfach positiver gestimmt als zum beispiel im winter der sommer strahlt ein positives lebensgef hl aus
514925 ich mag es wenn alles bl ht ich bin eine richtige blumentante
514926 das ist f r mich der inbegriff des sommers ich trage ihn so lange es geht wenn auch nur zuhause
514927 ich empfinde es als absolut positiv dass im sommer der ffentliche raum mehr f r die kommunikation benutzt wird
514928 die lauen abende der duft nach frisch gem htem gras mir f llt gar nichts ein was mir am sommer nicht gefallen w rde
514929 au er vielleicht die gespielte fr hlichkeit die viele bei sonnenschein an den tag legen und wenn sich die leute dar ber beratschlagen wie sie ihre schnecken am besten ermorden k nnen das ist tierqu lerei
514930 ich bergebe meiner nachfolgerin wirklich das beste einen guten chor eine neue orgel da kann jemand mit freude weiter arbeiten
514931 aber schon bald waren wir ein tolles team karl kniely und ernst ardac haben mir damals viel geholfen und auch die t tigkeit mit professor franz koringer war unglaublich bereichernd

514936 prinzipiell haben wir im winter nat rlich immer mehr zu tun aber auch im sommer gilt es auf dem berg einige regeln zu beachten vor allem das gewitterrisiko ist zur zeit sehr hoch

514945 unsere einzige m glichkeit ist die st cke regelm ig zu kontrollieren sollten die varroamilben den stock befallen m ssen wir dem mit eigenen mitteln sofort entgegenwirken
514946 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
514947 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
514948 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
514949 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
514950 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
514951 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
514952 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
514953 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
514954 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
514955 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
514956 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
514957 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
514958 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
514959 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
514960 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
514961 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
514962 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
514963 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
514964 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
514965 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
514966 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
514967 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
514968 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
514969 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
514970 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
514971 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
514972 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
514973 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
514974 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
514975 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
514976 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
514977 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
514978 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
514979 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
514980 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
514981 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
514982 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
514983 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
514984 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
514985 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
514986 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
514987 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
514988 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
514989 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
514990 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
514991 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
514992 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
514993 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
514994 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
514995 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
514996 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
514997 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
514998 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
514999 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
515000 who are open to doing something on the production side
515001 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
515002 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
515003 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
515004 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
515005 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
515006 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
515007 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
515008 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
515009 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
515010 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
515011 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
515012 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
515013 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
515014 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
515015 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
515016 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
515017 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
515018 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
515019 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
515020 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
515021 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
515022 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
515023 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
515024 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
515025 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe

515027 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
515028 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
515029 terrorism is not theoretical its right here a block away from this hotel and it must be fought with full force and strength
515030 for most of israels 60 years you have been deeply involved in this miracle that has blossomed and we are extremely grateful not ust as americans but as world citizens to your outstanding service to your country and the insight that you have shared with us
515031 there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players
515032 they let us do the work and develop the players and then they think they can just come in and offer him big wages but after they cannot come up with the transfer request
515033 we were destabilized by some clubs who did not respect the fair play rule in tapping up players
515034 i think we suffered from that at the end of the season we havent done that but that has been done to us
515035 and if we can come up with a genuine bi partisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something i am open to

515039 singularity implies infinite rate of change achieved momentarily future not amenable thereafter to prediction by presingularity beings right so has not happened
515040 au contraire it happened on june 6 1969 at eleven hundred hours eastern seaboard time
515041 that was when the first network control packets were sent from the data port of one imp to another the first ever internet communication thats the singularity since then weve been living in a universe that was impossible to predict from events prior to that time
515042 when youve lived long enough for all your ambitions to be in ruins friendships broken lovers forgotten or divorced acrimoniously whats left to go on for if you feel tired and old in spirit you might as well be tired and old in body
515043 anyway wanting to live forever is immoral think of all the resources youre taking up that younger people need even uploads face a finite data storage limit after a time its a monstrously egotistical statement to say you intend to live forever and if theres one thing i believe in its public service duty the obligation to make way for the new

515052 he who watches over israel will neither slumber nor sleep
515053 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
515054 and the guy the feds moved on next killed himself pretty darn quick
515055 im not going to tell you how we are going to come out on every case because it depends on the facts and circumstances presented
515056 but what we are saying is that if a man now walks in and makes a complaint we are going to take that complaint and investigate it which yes is something that wouldnt have happened in the past
515057 it was shocking to hear that they are making a conscious decision to apply the law to men even though the statute on its face explicitly only applies to women
515058 i said to ebel that it sounds like a radical change in the law by the mcad and his answer was i agree with you but we think it needs to be done
515059 the express language of the mmla provides leave only for female employees therefore the mcad will not assume jurisdiction over claims by male employees seeking leave
515060 based on what was said at the meeting i reluctantly stood up and asked ebel some pointed questions because our concern is that while the mcad has certain legal authority to interpret the law they do not have the authority to re write it which is what theyve done here
515061 saddle employers with a new benefit that has not been passed by the legislature so the idea that a client of mine could be subjected to significant legal fees to defend a complaint that is simply and obviously not covered by the statute is outrageous
515062 we are in the process of putting together a client alert so that those clients that werent at the meeting will be apprised of this development and made aware of how it could affect them
515063 theyre now saying that employers are going to be liable for violating a maternity leave law by not giving paternity leave and an employer would have no way of knowing this unless they went to our seminar
515064 my surprise and concern is that they did so without gathering comments and eliciting feedback from the business community and at least the bar
515065 they have always done that in the past whenever they have made a significant change to the guidelines
515066 for a long time savvy lawyers have been informing their clients that there was a potential pitfall here in this area of the law in massachusetts
515067 ive heard it at mcle where i have been an attendee not a presenter and for quite some time people have suggested in this legal community that there is danger in advising your management clients that the mmla only applies to women even though the statute says women and even though the commission had up until now issued guidelines that said otherwise
515068 if two women are married and adopt a child then they are both entitled to leave under the mmla and yet if two men are married and adopt a child they would be entitled to no leave under a strict reading of the statute
515069 that result was troubling to us and we didnt think it was in keeping with our mandate by statute which is to eliminate eradicate and prevent discrimination in massachusetts
515070 people it is very important that you stay with your documents

515092 we think party hosts who offer the pamper package will become the most popular parents in town
515093 we were surprised to learn that such a high proportion of parents heavily rely on verbal agreements to ensure their childrens online activities are safe and legal children are often more tech savvy than their parents and the click of a mouse can take them anywhere this research highlights the need for parents to be aware of the simple checks they can put in place to safeguard children who are increasingly using the internet to build new relationships

515106 tetapi sekiranya rakyat terus menyokong bn kita boleh dijamin dengan tidak adanya kebenaran resolusi dan kesudahan eksploitasi politik oleh bn atas tragedi tersebut
515107 dengan adanya lebih banyak pembangkang di parlimen dan dewan undangan negeri bn akan lebih berhati hati sebelum menggunakan sebarang isu perkauman murahan di kalangan rakyat
515108 it could only lead to more confrontation as society is still not mature enough to revisit may 13
515109 it should not be taught to young malaysians unless the history books are written accurately and carefully
515110 the past is the past and we should not be looking back
515111 we have a vision ahead to fulfill not a nightmare to look back on
515112 the rakyat voted for opposition not because of may 13 issue but they wanted change
515113 it is done so with the apparent reason of instilling fear in the public
515114 the commission would help society to have an open debate and identify those responsible for the riots regardless of which party they are from
515115 the may 13 incident took place over three or four days and we have talked about this national catastrophe for years malaysians have been living peacefully for 500 years why dont we talk about this instead
515116 declassified documents on the malaysian riots of 1969 by dr
515117 malaysias proud experiment in constructing a multiracial society exploded in the streets of kuala lumpur last week malay mobs wearing white headbands signifying an alliance with death and brandishing swords and daggers surged into chinese areas in the capital burning looting and killing in retaliation chinese sometimes aided by indians armed themselves with pistols and shotguns and struck at malay kampongs huge pillars of smoke rose skyward as houses shops and autos burned
515118 in malaysia we grow up and live in a culture of fear in the shadow of may 13 that fear has been built into our political system and has remained a part of our psychology
515119 suddenly the screen went red and the words emergency declared in large black letters were flashed there was a mad rush to lock the cinema gates just as an armed gang tried to break in
515120 i took refuge in a nearby police station for about five or six days until the killings stopped
515121 i believe that this time around there was a greater determination to preserve the peace i think the security forces were a little confused in 1969 which is why then home minister tun dr ismail had to bring in the sarawak rangers
515122 a focal point of may 13 was communal divisions even though the alliance had lost kelantan to pas many contests were largely pitched as malay versus non malay it was the non malay vote that swung very sharply to the then opposition parties of gerakan dap and ppp
515123 in the case of march 8 the support for the pakatan rakyat parties came from all three major races so the situation therefore was far less explosive
515124 during that time when singapore was part of malaysia chinese outnumbered malays this led the malays to fear displacement in their own homeland the brand of politics that lee kuan yew practised further frightened the malays the sino malay riots of 1964 were a big thing and one reason why tunku took steps to cut singapore off
515125 in reality it was the result of multiple factors like the movie vantage point which presents eight viewpoints from eight persons on one event the attempt to assassinate a us president there can be many vantage points to may 13 official personal and even conspiratorial ones
515126 is the noc report accurate without touching on the plot to topple tunku to me it is the unhappiness that some umno members had with tunku by 1969 was real but it did not feature as a cause of the may 13 incident
515127 the incident however sharpened the unhappiness of the malays with tunku and fuelled the movement to replace him with his deputy tun abdul razak
515128 as the coordinator of the special branch investigations into the incident and having read all the statements from eye witnesses which formed the basis of the noc report i am convinced of its accuracy
515129 i was part of the umno youth committee that held a meeting on the morning of may 13 and our plan was clear we would hold a counter victory celebration to remind people that even though we had a smaller majority we were still victorious
515130 however when we assembled at the selangor mentri besars house shocking incidents happened we were handed headbands and weapons were produced it was definite that there were some elements in umno who were opposed to tunkus leadership and who had come with an ulterior motive and planned something more sinister
515131 i witnessed a killing of an innocent coffee shop boy we were unaware and unprepared for such a situation a crazy mob had taken over and i and fellow umno youth members were helpless
515132 appeared to be planned by some group because hidden weapons and headbands were distributed
515133 was too ancient an animosity to be allowed to hold national unity to ransom
515134 may 13 is part of our history and is consistently trotted out by politicians who want to play the racial card to show us what will happen if the privileges of the ruling class are threatened
515135 at the moment the blame is put largely on the back of the opposition but questions must be asked about the role of the military the police and certain ruling party officials who represented the emerging capitalist class we dont need to trot out the gory details which will inflame passions but the truth must not be covered up
515136 we should stop sweeping it under the carpet may 13 is a ghost that must be exorcised as long as it remains a hidden censored part of history then it hinders our maturing as a people and a nation and will continue to haunt us
515137 saying that if the opposition parties continue to fan communal sentiments another may 13 will happen adding with a raised index finger dan jangan salahkan kami then dont blame us
515138 please spare us the threat of another dreadful may 13
515139 after 39 years it is time to bury deep the ghost of may 13 once for all so that it never raises its ugly head again
515140 for one it is a well flogged threat used by some politicians for their own agenda and two it does not work any more all it does is that it raises painful memories of the black chapter in our history of our otherwise harmonious relations between all races
515141 on that fateful day i was a young officer serving in the army i witnessed first hand the carnage as it unfolded people were attacked because they were of the wrong race at the wrong place at the wrong time everyone suffered
515142 rather than trying to decipher the truth from the official version if one exists or from listening to unofficial or underground versions or simply putting every rumour on hold until living memories fade away and are replaced by mere myths and legends why not have the events of may 13 1969 properly and definitively recorded and reviewed
515143 reconciliation must start first with the truth only then will we be able to lay matters well to rest once and for all
515144 we dont know anything about what happened because the government has closed this entire chapter of our history the incident happened too far back for us to hate or incite anger anymore but we need to know what happened factually accurately once and for all
515145 our young malaysians have no idea whats may 13 while the older people remain bitter unless we acknowledge and confess to what happened the spirit of may 13 will continue to be present each time the malays feel threatened or when the chinese feel cheated or outraged it will never end
515146 it sold like hot cakes when it came out last year most of the buyers were working adults in their 30s when i asked them how they knew about it since there was little publicity in the press they told me they found out about it on the internet and were curious to know more
515147 i remember one buyer described the book as valuable history at a cheap price as it was sold at only rm20
515148 she still thinks there can be another may 13 incident so during the last general election she advised me to stay home to me its important to understand past events so that we can work together better in the future
515149 but now it is used so widely for political parties and leaders to pursue their objectives i remember being nervous when i heard the stories from my parents and i am still worried now
515150 the first racial riots were in august september 1945 and were caused by the communist party of malaya going around punishing chinese and indian collaborators after the japanese occupation ended but when they punished the malays especially the banjaris in the batu pahat area they fought back and this spread to other banjari areas like batu kikir in negri sembilan and sungai manik in perak
515151 may 13 has been given special attention in our media history books and realpolitik but the sino malay ethnic riots in 1945 were bigger and bloodier they were more widespread and continued for a longer period for two weeks with a toll estimated at more than 2 000 lives
515152 why is this conflict never mentioned every time we talk about racial riots in malaysia it reminds me of what french historian ernest renan once said history is about remembering and forgetting
515153 it is historical therapeutic and awareness raising to talk and analyse these conflicts between 1945 and 1969 in a rational and reasoned manner and not use it as a threat to incite racial hatred or fulfil an ethnicised political agenda
515154 people try not to talk about may 13 because they dont know how to handle it you cannot start by blaming one side or another the procession through kampung baru was certainly unfortunate but it did not justify such a wave of killings
515155 after 1969 we became vulnerable each race is told that it is somebody elses fault we expect our leaders to play a part in defusing tensions but instead there are many who thrive on constantly fuelling the fears of the people
515156 the recent elections just put paid to my theory that such riots might recur if the government lost its two thirds majority
515157 everybody should also realise especially our politicians that you can never solve sensitive issues by confrontation
515158 people should be reminded that barisan nasional was formed after may 13 after the alliance party of umno mca and mic was broadened to include former opposition parties the reason being that the huge coalition would help reduce inflammatory politicking
515159 ethnic champions should always be disapproved of in a multi ethnic society
515160 you have got my wife and child in your house and i have come for them
515161 yes yes i know you ask because i am a malay my wife is chinese and she is very small and my baby is only a few months old can i now please come in
515162 i was going to take you back from school hurry hurry go home there is going to be trouble
515163 spread rumours and i will report you to the police there wont be trouble just stay home
515164 hello dont be afraid i am a soldier if you are in there please knock back
515165 the participation in the world economic forum has given us a realisation that the policy adopted by the present government for the development of karachi investment and other related matters is in the right direction and our goal is nearer now
515166 i congratulate the people of pakistan and specially of karachi and it is a good omen for his party that he represented his country and city on this forum and had the opportunity of marketing karachi nullifying the negative impression about pakistan and specially this city at the international level
515167 we are now developing karachi as a major trade and economic centre on the world map and we have taken up this city as a regional city

515172 do not really believe in the values of old europe because they put adherence to the democratic process above loyalty to european civilization lindbergh was right when he claimed that the modern struggle had nothing to do with political systems it was and is about race if you accept the rules of your enemy who only allows you to vote for a slow death or a quick death you will be bereft of everything that europeans once held dear
515173 i think we miss something essential if we do not see how love of race and love of christ are interwoven in the soul of the european when the european embraced christ he did not suddenly lose the virtues he already possessed those virtues were extended and deepened shame became guilt and kindness was transformed into charity and pride of race the desire to see ones race perpetuated became love of race and a desire to see the individual members of ones beloved race survive in perpetuity
515174 from the testimony of christian soldiers like thomas nelson page that the struggle for the christian faith and the struggle for the white race have the same spiritual antecedents
515175 they had succeeded in once again convincing the north the midwest the west and the rest of the european people that the southern europeans were devils and even the southern people themselves came to believe in the evils of the old south it was no coincidence that the british ceased to believe in britain the spanish in spain the french in france etc at the same time the south was an extension of europe satan would not attack one without attacking the other
515176 yes they were class but we need to be careful wearent like that now

515228 i have listened now several times to two messages from the 2008 resolved conference by cj mahaney and john piper the shocking phrase they both chose to use to describe jesus finished work of redemption on the cross for the elect was the scream of the damned no they are not referring to unregenerate people in hell or the weeping and gnashing of teeth from perditions flames but using this to describe the sinless holy son of god as our divine substitute the lord jesus christ the righteous now called the damned this is unthinkable those words not only stunned me but it did stir my interest afresh to go back and study again the atoning work of our lord jesus christ on the cross with those provocative words in mind
515229 gods wrath vengeance is mine i will repay says the lord
515230 jesus christ perfectly righteous and perfectly damned on the cross in our place

515307 ci sono due parole che ritornano frequentemente nei nostri discorsi anzi sono le parole chiave dei nostri discorsi queste due parole sono sono due sinonimi o se non sono due sinonimi indicano due momenti diversi di uno stesso fenomeno oppure indicano due fenomeni diversi che per si integrano necessariamente fra di loro oppure ancora indicano due fenomeni solo parzialmente analoghi e sincronici infine indicano due fenomeni opposti fra di loro che solo apparentemente coincidono e si integrano bisogna assolutamente chiarire il senso di queste due parole e il loro rapporto se vogliamo capirci in discussione che riguarda molto da vicino la nostra vita anche quotidiana e fisica
515308 la figura del labirinto diventa infinitamente prossima alle metamorfosi che culminavano nel passaggio dalla vita alla morte e al mantenimento della vita nella morte il labirinto conduce a un minotauro che specchio specchio della morte e della nascita luogo profondo e inaccessibile di tutte le metamorfosi in quel luogo le differenze si raggiungono e ritrovano lidentit la casualit della morte e dellorigine divise dalla sottile lamina dello specchio si trovano collocate nello stesso piano virtuale ma vertiginoso del doppio

515312 the mask is indeed a figure with a fashion of behaving of its own
515313 the figure of the labyrinth becomes incommensurably close to the metamorphoses climaxing in the passage from life to death and the retention of life in death

515392 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
515393 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living
515394 my whole eye orbit had to be reconfigured with three metal plates and 12 screws the experienced surgeon who operated on my eye told me that i was lucky to be alive and just as lucky to still have my eye

515409 i wasnt drafted i enlisted in september 1940 before the draft started
515410 i went into the service to learn more about photography the recruiters knew that the draft was coming up and they didnt care where they sent you so they sent me to 322nd signal aviation company which is communications i didnt find that out until i got up to selfridge field michigan
515411 after i took basic training i transferred over to the 3rd air base troops at selfridge field to the photo section there that was the time when i got up in grades from private to private first class then corporal and then sergeant
515412 from there i flew in a couple of missions submarine control in b 25s as a photographer at that time the army air force wasnt well equipped on the b 25s i was back where the camera was and the guns were two wooden sticks
515413 wilmington was practically on the coast after a few weeks there we got transferred up to fort dix new jersey
515414 we got all of our equipment ready to ship overseas
515415 i might mention on the ship the food was lousy period if it hadnt been for the american px i think i would have starved we had 10 000 people aboard and the british are not the greatest cooks to begin with in my estimation
515416 of course when we got to scotland we didnt have any english money but we had american money and i think we overpaid the gals in american money for the cakes but that was all right
515417 i got assigned to a barracks and i gradually got acquainted there then we had a chance to go to london to get some equipment for our photo lab
515418 and then we went up to cambridge north of london we were stationed with the british troops up there we learned about aerial photography from the fighters point of view and how to interpret gunfire from fighters using gun cameras
515419 then we went back to london and stayed there a couple of days i had a good chance to do london and learn the subways it was a very interesting place i dont know if youve ever heard of hyde park its a place where all these oddball characters have got speeches for everything on every subject
515420 we were there for a while and then we got transferred down to southern england near to southampton
515421 it was a bed and breakfast you know the english are famous for that
515422 after we were there for a while we got notice we were moving out
515423 we circled around the atlantic for a few days then we passed through the straits of gibraltar and landed at oran in algeria
515424 we were there for a few days then we moved to a french air base called tafaroui a few miles out of oran
515425 we set up a photo lab there and did the general work that a photo lab has to do film processing and printing but it wasnt what i eventually got into there i was with the 99th bomb group
515426 then they wanted some fellows to go out on detached service to go up to the base near oran we were kind of fed up with where we were so about six of us said well go we set up a photo lab up there we could go up any time we wanted there was no one to oversee us
515427 then the bomb group came in to the airport at oran they needed photographers because ground echelon hadnt shown up yet so they asked us if we wanted to go and we said sure
515428 we had no orders but the co of the bomb group was a colonel
515429 we each had pup tents so each put up a shelter a few days went by and some of the ground crew of the bomb group showed up then we got regular tents and a regular mess hall and everything when we got there they had just put in a new runway and we had the rainy season the first plane that tried to land got struck in the mud so our bomb group had to land at a base a few miles east of there for a couple of weeks along until it dried out
515430 we kind of got to know the routine and we started doing combat flying i had never done combat flying before i had done aerial photography of sorts it was on the job training you know in the states you go through six or eight weeks of training
515431 no medical exam nothing just start work of course thats the difference between state side and combat zone
515432 then we flew to targets in sicily and algeria and southern italy and up as far as rome and naples
515433 the plane was a b 17 and it had a 10 man crew as the photographer i was the eleventh man early in the war they sometimes flew the photographer as the eleventh man later on they changed that so one of the crewmembers was left out and the photographer was put in his place
515434 on my seventeenth mission i call it my sixteenth and a half because i got there and didnt get when i went down
515435 we got the bale out orders the crewmembers were standing at bomb bay and we stared at each other and considered who would go first they pointed at me and it was no time to argue so i pulled the ring
515436 there are straps across your legs across your chest on your shoulder and seat back and across the chest is a big buckle way down on your chest when the chute opens that buckle comes right under your chin and you get a good jolt then thats why you see paratroopers wearing a chin guard
515437 the chute starts swinging back and forth well then i started to worry if the chutes going to spill then ive had it the chute leveled off and the next thing i knew there were german fighters circling around
515438 i thought oh theyre going to put a shell through the chute
515439 but he was a gentleman he just brought himself to the ground troops i landed next to a farm area i had a few minor flesh wounds from flack and the machinegun fire
515440 incidentally before i jumped our oxygen went off during gunfire you have walk around bottles of oxygen so i was just reaching for one of those when a machine gun fired in and it exploded just before i put my hand on it lucky me
515441 as i said we landed next to a farmhouse i got out of my chute got out of my flying clothes and went in the house
515442 yes this was on sicily they were relatively friendly they didnt make any nasty moves toward me at all
515443 the italian carbinari came along the carbinari is kind of a paramilitary police force of the italian army he took me into the nearest village and there i was interrogated by an italian officer
515444 as you know all you are allowed to share is name rank and serial number he asked all kinds of questions and i gave the same answer over and over again you know italians are very volatile in expressions he was literally jumping up and down in frustration because i wasnt going to give him answers
515445 then they put me in a cell in the city jail i was all by myself they brought me some food but i was so unnerved i couldnt eat oh i might have eaten a little but not much
515446 they collected those of us who were captured they put us on a bus one guard for each prisoner we were to go inland to some town i dont know what the town was there we were put in the city jail
515447 they gave us a meal it was me in the cell with two of the officers the cell consisted of some boards to sleep on no pillow no blanket no mattress nothing just the plain boards the door was locked the sanitary facilities were outside so you had to knock on the door if you had to use them
515448 the next morning they took me out and put me in a cell with a so called south african fighter pilot i figured out right away that he was a stoolie he claimed that he had been shot down that he was flying a mosquito flyer when he was shot down it was a good story
515449 so we talked but we just talked about little stuff nothing that was incriminating we were let out twice a day for meals for sanitary facilities as far as for urinary there was bucket in the corner that hadnt been emptied for some days the sleeping quarters were the same as in the other cell boards
515450 in my cell i was with this so called south african
515451 then we got loaded on the bus the same bus with carbinari one carbinari for each soldier
515452 we got back on the bus after the raid went by and we went farther down the road to catania
515453 one time i was in the hallway of the train and i met what i think was probably a german ss troop because he was a young man but very arrogant in his appearance he was dressed to the nines he just walked right by me he didnt know who i was and he didnt bother to find out either
515454 we went through naples and up to rome there we were taken to an internment camp outside rome we could see the vatican from there but the vatican is a large complex so its easy to check out
515455 the camp was surrounded by three large coils of barbed wire one of which was supposed to have been electrified
515456 there again we got let out twice a day and fed twice a day
515457 after we were there for a few days we were taken back into rome station
515458 then after a day or two the fellow i was with found out the room was bugged so we had to be very careful about our conversation
515459 it was so well camouflaged in the decorations on the ceiling you could hardly see it i didnt see it but he was more observant than i was
515460 after a couple of days there they took us to the other part of that so called villa to a big room there was about 20 or 25 men in there there we had a mattress cover filled with straw one blanket one pillow that was it our luxury quarters were gone
515461 we were there for a few days and then back to rome where we got a train going across to the east coast of italy to the port of st george
515462 then we got onto an urban type train and headed to servigliano which was the town where the prison camp was p g 59
515463 in this camp there were a variety of british soldiers from england and from all around the british empire there was a building right next to us that had cypriots in it the guards patrolled the camp day and night
515464 during the day we were allowed to roam around the camp as much as we wanted to every morning we had inspection and head counting to make sure everybody was there
515465 then we got word something was up we got a red cross parcel and things werent punched i dont know if i mentioned already everything in a can in the red cross parcel was punched it kept us from hoarding in case we tried to escape
515466 the prison wall was next to our building and there was a deep ditch next to the wall
515467 we could get close up to talk to the guards it was toward the end of september i cant remember the exact date we got the message to put everything we wanted together
515468 so i got my blanket i used my sweater for a knapsack and put all my goods in there i just kind of sat around it was early evening then we got the just get out of here there were a few shots fired and the gate was open and we called headed out
515469 i might mention that while we were in prison we got to walk outside the prison camp
515470 we fled across the fields there was stuff all over the fields where the guys were dropping stuff i dropped my italian jacket and picked up a british battle jacket we crossed rivers we didnt worry about how deep a river was we just crossed it and kept going we were heading inland toward the mountains
515471 no we had nothing but dumb luck thats all we had no maps we got quite a ways away there were eight or nine of us together we huddled down in a ditch there were trees on both sides that first morning we heard shots from one end nobody moved after awhile we heard shots from the other end nobody moved
515472 that was all there was in the way of someone searching for us we had one fellow in the group from new york he was italian and he spoke good italian so he went to this farmhouse the people brought us food they fed us a couple of times a day they brought us a bottle of wine to share
515473 at night we would go up there they had a radio listen to bbc and forces of war then we would go back into our hiding place after we were there for a few days we headed inland the guy who spoke italian stayed with them because he could pass himself for an italian and he had a good place to stay
515474 oh one thing i wanted to mention before this about the escape some of the guys at night had been digging a tunnel there were cement blocks for the floors of the barracks the guys removed them set them aside and started digging they had quite a tunnel i guess i didnt know about it
515475 one fellow who was with us an american told us about it after the escape
515476 the next place we stayed near there there were three homes different families
515477 after a few days just three of us stayed behind the others decided they were going to try to get through so they headed south we stayed put we helped with the chores around there we helped with the grape harvest
515478 the italians when they make wine they make it in huge quantities
515479 after it was down to pulp they pressed the pulp through a wine press then the wine was put in a cooker and cooked for a certain length of time that made a much stronger wine
515480 the fighter pilot and i decided we would head south and see what we could do we stopped at several different places on the way i traded my good coat for an old ragged coat for the simple reason that i could walk on the hills and wouldnt be noticed i would be just another one of the italians
515481 as i said we stopped at a number of different places
515482 we finally convinced them to heat the water and we took it down to the stable we slipped down and took a bath we had an audience at the window watching those crazy americans taking a bath
515483 and at christmastime we were there we had a real big dinner we had some kind of fruit i wasnt sure what it was but it was very good anyhow and we had a special wine
515484 there we took the oxen down to the river to drink the oxen were on their own we just went along thats all they took us down after they got their fill we turned around and headed back up to the stable that was all there was to it the first couple of times it was kind of a joke doing that
515485 they had one girl there oh she was a beauty but that was all the good it did us she was friendly and i got close to her and talked to her that was it period i remember her name was veneria
515486 there was a village nearby and so on occasion we would go into town there were a couple of friendly people there who would inform us of what was going on one day we were in this wine shop having a glass of wine and a german convoy stopped youve never seen three guys disappear so fast
515487 we went out the back door quick as a shot ran down the back hills and we were gone the german convoy had just stopped for a break or whatever
515488 on occasions they would go around to all these different places to get boys 14 or 15 years old for their labor battalions the italians had what i call the underground telegraph system the guys could be 10 miles away and we knew they were coming wed take off and head back into the hills until the coast was clear and then wed head back
515489 another place we stayed it was just larry and me there at this place they were very good to me they were one of the better class of italian farmers i came down with a cold and they let me sleep upstairs in the bed for a couple of days to get over it
515490 one morning before we got up they woke us up and told us to get out of there quick we looked down the road and just about of quarter of a mile from there was a german convoy and a house on fire we didnt question anything we were gone
515491 when we came back a few months later we were told that there had been two americans living in that house
515492 that was probably as close as we had come to being recaptured
515493 well they lost their house and all their possessions they were just a small ss troop but they were mean sobs if you know what i mean
515494 we moved back and forth between different places it was when we came back to this place that i was told about this assassination
515495 well we were trying to move south but there was no way to get through it was the kind of country where all the good roads the germans were using we couldnt travel on those we would get close to any village and they would say tedeschi tedeschi that was their name for the germans
515496 one time i got a notion to go north all by myself and see what i could do i came to this farmhouse and they let me move in sleep in the stables of course the peasant way of life is so different from ours this woman was very pregnant and one day she wasnt out working well come to hear she just had her baby well what was nothing so unusual next day she was out working here a woman would stay home a week and recuperate
515497 then i went back to where i started the fellows had moved out and had built themselves a cave they were afraid of the germans coming in that in their retreat they might come through there
515498 after a few days of that questionable living i heard the germans were going around us they were moving back up so i decided to move on
515499 i walked to the nearest village and caught a ride with an italian army truck that was going south they let me off but i didnt know where i was i started hitchhiking again and i caught a ride with an italian truck driver
515500 now the only thing that italians know about driving is theyve got an accelerator and theyve got a horn the brakes they dont use
515501 we had to take all the back roads which in many cases were single track and we went around hills with sharp curves more than once we almost met head on with another truck but we finally got through and got to chieti
515502 there i met my first american officer and i had been with the british so long i gave him a british salute
515503 i went back into town and i went to a local hotel and got a room the room consisted of a bed a mattress and a pillow and that was it then i went to a restaurant to eat
515504 we got to the seacoast and there was a camp that was run by british soldiers
515505 on the railhead going north the germans had what i call a super plow it went on the last car of the train its huge its sharp it digs down way below the wheels so as its pulled on the train it splits all the ties it ruins the rail bed
515506 i was on the train all night and got up in the morning at bari italy
515507 in the morning a nurse came in a nice white american nurse
515508 i was shot down july 5 and returned to allied territory on june 31 it was almost a year that i was gone
515509 i monkeyed around there for a while and they said your outfits up the road youre supposed to go up there i was on my own so to speak i was booked to a flight in the morning then i missed it
515510 one unit was the first armored division and the other was the royal canadian air force they were in different places we went down south on a landing craft we didnt go by train or on trucks
515511 of the guys in my photo section some of them had completed their missions and had gone back some of them had got shot down and were captured some of them had got killed so there were only a few from the original numbers left including my tech sergeant
515512 they said well you got your orders to go back to the states so you go back to bari
515513 i got back to bari and they said well you can go to the isle of capri first that was a rest camp for the air force or you can fly back
515514 knowing the fortunes of war if i went to the isle of capri i might get sent back to my outfit and id start flying again i said im going home
515515 so i flew a c 47 from italy to catania and i ended up in algiers
515516 from gibraltar to casablanca i was still on a c 47 from casablanca luxury flight
515517 he was shocked because everybody from my hometown thought i was dead
515518 yeah you see when youre shot down you were declared either dead or missing in action i was declared missing in action the international red cross sent the address of the camp but of course the camp broke up before any letter could get to me so they didnt know where i was or whether i was dead or alive most of them thought i was dead
515519 yeah they did because they had my address what you were allowed was like a postcard
515520 yeah they wrote to me all the letters went back to them ive got the whole pack of letters upstairs
515521 then i went down to a camp in virginia for interrogation
515522 i headed for home i went to chicago and visited ft sheridan illinois
515523 the officer at the camp said you want to be a guard at the prison camp
515524 if you want me to i said the first jerry whos gotten near the fence is dead
515525 i went back to chicago on furlough and i went home i had two weeks furlough i dont think i had too many sober days while i was home its just that it was a super release from all the tension i had gone through
515526 then i had my travel orders to go to miami beach
515527 there i met one of my buddies from the outfit he was in the hospital too it was real nice there you could come and go as you pleased we had regular mealtimes of course but wed go into town and go to dances and eat in good restaurants and have a good time
515528 there were social activities at the hospital we went swimming in the gulf of mexico there were dolphins a few hundred yards out
515529 in the morning id look at the bulletin board nothing on it so id go for a swim
515530 at that time i was living like a citizen there were plenty of times wed have
515531 there were some nice girls who invited us to their apartment to have dinner with them we stuck to socializing they were really nice girls
515532 i asked if i could get a three day pass
515533 i finished processing and the next thing i got travel orders to go to oklahoma city to will rogers field i never did get my three day pass
515534 interrogation checking to see if you are still fit for service or whether you should be discharged all that sort of stuff
515535 at will rogers field i found out that the co of the outfit was the guy who had been master sergeant or tech sergeant of the photo section we had when i was with the 99th bomb group
515536 so one morning i went over to his office and i asked permission to see the commanding officer
515537 you dont call the co an old son of a bitch that was the only time i got away with something like that he invited me over to his house once for dinner socially we couldnt get together because officers and enlisted men werent supposed to associate
515538 i got to madison and in getting my uniform together i got a cap more like an officers cap more like an overseas type cap it had all kinds of braid on it
515539 i had to register when i got there the officer at the desk said i was restricted to camp for one week that was a great greeting after being a pow
515540 for a couple of days i just wandered around the camp they knew i was supposed to come but they didnt know who i was or where i was on camp i checked back in a couple of days and they said oh yeah still looking around
515541 i was the senior nco in the photo lab after i had been in the barracks for a couple of days i found out the previous guy who had been there had made a bunk in one of the desks i checked it out and said thats for me
515542 so i checked out of the other barracks and moved into the photo lab i had to get up early before anyone else that was the only difference
515543 they sent me with a whole bunch who were going up to camp mccoy to get discharged i got up there and got discharged out of the service i got on a train and headed for milwaukee and naturally had a drink
515544 the mps came through the bar and said soldier youve got to get out of here
515545 i had relatives in milwaukee i stayed with them for a couple of days and then i went home that was the end of my military career it was worth a million and i wouldnt take a million to do it again
515546 the war was over finished everything was over i enlisted for three years when i went in i enlisted i wasnt drafted
515547 i joined in 1940 and the war started in 41 i had been in a little over a year before the war started i remember the time we got word on the radio the war had started i had told a buddy of mine we are going to detroit
515548 tours were restricted but we went to detroit of course naturally i was barhopping you couldnt buy a drink that night everyone was buying us a drink because the war was on
515549 the mps would come along youve got to get back to your barracks
515550 we didnt argue with them we just left and went to the next bar
515551 when i enlisted i never thought i would go through all i did because it was peacetime we knew things in europe were not good but we just didnt anticipate war of course i had never thought of japan at that time when i enlisted
515552 when we first got orders to move from selfridge field i thought oh shoot are we going to the pacific i hope not
515553 ill mention one thing about the camp i probably didnt mention before the camp used southern european style of sanitary facilities squat and strain thats not only in prison camps but its also out in public stalls like that you see in streets in oran but a lot of things in europe seemed strange its a whole different culture
515554 i had one but it wasnt a complete address ive never written i should try and see whether i get an answer or not chances are theyve all gone to the great beyond by now
515555 well this one daughter i mentioned a very nice looking young lady she might still be living it might be a possibility but she probably would be the only one of those from where we stayed
515556 i have it written down someplace i dont have it handy
515557 i dont think a day goes by that i dont think of something in regards to the service i dont go around talking to people about it it just goes through my mind thats all its just one of those things once youve been through what ive been through you never forget it
515558 a lot of men wont talk at all they just cant i may have mentioned to you i never told my wife about service too much just the good times we were at a meeting in rochester one time and the speaker didnt show up
515559 the commander of that group said well do it different today will each of you tell us something of what you went through
515560 when it came to my turn i gave a very brief resum
515561 saint paul tells us that the church not the university the media or the public schools is the pillar and support of the truth 1 timothy
515562 first why is our impact not proportionate to our numbers if the evangelical community is even one third the size polls tell us it is we should be turning this culture upside down second why are ministers no longer viewed as the intellectual and cultural leaders in their communities that they once were compared to pastors of the past contemporary ministers have lost much of their authority among both unbelievers and the members of their own flocks third how is it possible for a person to be an active member of an evangelical church for twenty or thirty years and still know next to nothing about the history and theology of the christian religion the methods and tools required for serious bible study and the skills and information necessary to preach and defend christianity in a post christian neo pagan culture
515563 filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another
515564 and it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment
515565 destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of god and take every thought captive to obey christ
515566 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
515567 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
515568 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
515569 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
515570 has the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to listen than the fat of rams and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry because you have rejected the word of the lord he has also rejected you
515571 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
515572 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
515573 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
515574 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated

515588 i had on my portfolio all the glowing credentials with a beneficial compensation package and thru hard work and dedication i reached a vice president position with one of the top companies in the state i eventually bought into ownership with an investment of 65 000 that led to a 1 partnership status that involved an incredible sacrifice personally on a daily basis while taking time away from my great family i was caught in the glamour lifestyle that many experience that rewards one financially but effects negatively the critical aspects of their personal life and at that stage i personally decided that family time over career status was a higher calling for me and found the solution life is short and when you have a core value of a great wife and 2 kids you need to make it count and i do every day with my new business venture

515651 real madrid believe he is important for the future and they trust qpr to take him for one year or two years to assist in his development and of course it will be good for qpr and good for the championship
515652 for me it is very important to deal with people you trust i had lunch with parejo and ramon calderon two months ago in madrid and we reached an agreement parejo is excited and we hope to finalise the deal on monday it will be fantastic for qpr and for the championship it will make things even more interesting

515657 our vision for qpr is not to be a middle of the road premier league club
515658 we want to be competitive and we want to strive to be a champions league club but thats an aspiration for a long way down the road the way to be successful is to set achievable targets which give us enough time to get there because our commitment to the club is long term we have no pressure to be promoted immediately we want it of course but lets spend time and effort to build this thing the right way
515659 chelsea have done a great job under roman abramovich but everybody has their own style
515660 when i was in charge at benetton we made t shirts and went from this to winning the world championship when nobody gave us a chance against ferrari and mclaren the big teams here i talk all the time to the manager of the team iain dowie he is an integral part of the structure we have in place like the engineer and the driver working together in f1 so i speak to the players before we bring them to the club because personality is fundamental and i want everything to be correct i want them to stay here forever so we must be compatible their goals must be my goals and the managers goals this is not about ego for me or bernie or lakshmi we did not buy the club to be famous we are famous already look i have seen so many coaches make poor a lot of rich people turning big fortunes into small fortunes very quickly so we want to manage the club our way
515661 you have to work on the underbelly of the club and bringing in young lads like di carmine will be great for our future
515662 we want to be an aggressive enthusiastic side playing high tempo football and passing the ball the lads have embraced the work ethic thats the desire we want here sometimes i speak to flavio two or three times a day so communication is not a problem trying to hear him over the roar of engines is the hard part

515742 i havent done anything that most people physically probably couldnt do i just found a niche where i could do something that not many other people wanted to do
515743 i thought this isnt particularly easy but it doesnt bother me any so im going to do it longer and harder than anybody else and see what happens
515744 thats probably the worst race i ever ran in my life
515745 i was running well winning a lot of races but i knew something wasnt right

515758 i am deeply troubled about the continuing threats and attacks against humanitarian agencies working in darfur
515759 following two attacks against their teams and premises in just one week m decins sans fronti res has announced it has no choice but to evacuate its team from two locations in north darfur the departure of msf team leaves some 65 000 people without essential medical assistance
515760 impunity for such attacks must end hundreds of thousands of people rely on the assistance these aid organizations deliver and we cannot afford to have them absent from darfur
515761 of 12 reports of convulsions or hyponatremia following the use of desmopressin nasal spray seven involved children under 13 years of age
515762 avoidance of excessive fluid intake should be advised during treatment with desmopressin
515763 the ongoing need for these products should be reviewed periodically in patients taking desmopressin long term
515764 violent extremist movements such as al qaida and its associates comprise a complex and urgent challenge
515765 like communism and fascism before it todays violent extremist ideology rejects the rules and structures of the international system
515766 its adherents reject state sovereignty ignore borders and attempt to deny self determination and human dignity wherever they gain power
515767 i firmly believe that in the years ahead our military is much more likely to engage in asymmetric conflict than conventional conflict against a rising state power
515768 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the united states we must defeat violent extremism as a threat to our way of life as a free and open society and foster an environment inhospitable to violent extremists and all those who support them
515769 the principal challenge is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons we learned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment
515770 whenever possible the defense department will position itself both to respond to and reduce uncertainty

515798 concord has come a long way since its launch 10 years ago
515799 we have successfully provided an accessible and affordable option for legal education we have more than 800 graduates across the country who are making their mark on the legal community and in their work places and we are partnering with traditional law schools to provide an online platform to deliver legal education we expect that over the next 10 years concord will continue to redefine legal education in the u s and beyond
515800 the mission of concord law school has been to expand access to a high quality legal education for students who cannot participate in traditional programs

515815 they demanded we hand over our wallets i think they look for any excuse to hook into tourists
515816 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
515817 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living
515818 my whole eye orbit had to be reconfigured with three metal plates and 12 screws the experienced surgeon who operated on my eye told me that i was lucky to be alive and just as lucky to still have my eye

515844 she intends to resume her swimming career as soon as possible and to again fulfill her olympic dream in 2012
515845 their faith in her was justified and she will soon give them more reason to be proud of her and her accomplishments
515846 they were asking to enter the state of israel after being threatened by hamas gunmen
515847 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
515848 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
515849 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
515850 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
515851 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
515852 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
515853 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
515854 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
515855 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
515856 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
515857 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
515858 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
515859 the fact that 56 000 americans each year are contracting hiv for the first time is a wake up call for all of us in the u s
515860 every year more than 15 000 people are dying from this disease and aids is a major killer for some of our minority communities
515861 the key thing we have to focus on now is what how and when do we begin to enhance the prevention responses to end this epidemic
515862 so hows your getting hitched at age 25 plan coming along
515863 wah quite nice you think guys will like kissing a peppermint flavored lips
515864 this is not racism it is anger about the fact that millions of latinos are here with only their feet as their passport and their pockets are filled with cash from stolen jobs
515865 what these kids did was wrong and i hope they are executed for this cowardly hateful treatment of another human being
515866 these places are already stepping up to the mark to deliver more housing so now were looking to support that development by getting the right infrastructure in place
515867 this funding plays a critical role in supporting local authorities to ensure housing developments are properly planned with high quality infrastructure at the centre
515868 let us thank norm for his service and give our vote to paul richmond
515869 why would we settle for a candidate that continues to show an inability to heed the wishes of the people of his district or one whose vision is simply outdated instead let us come together to select the candidate that will put the peoples needs first
515870 i couldnt have been happier to work for congressman dicks during the 2006 election cycle
515871 all of us on the campaign worked tirelessly to help norm win one of his largest victories i was filled with hope and pride as we gathered together on election night and realized that not only had norm won re election in a landslide but the democrats had won huge victories all over the country giving them control of the house and the senate the democrats and dicks with them were given a mandate to end the war in iraq and hold the bush administration accountable for its actions that hope and pride has been replaced with frustration that two years later neither has happened or appears likely to happen with representatives such as congressman dicks in office

515886 guitar hero is a really funny craze kind of like the hula hoop
515887 it also is one big reason why so many really young kids are showing up at heart concerts these days
515888 we usually shoot 2 0for the same vibe and pick players and vocalists that will work with the song
515889 we dont over think it we just have them play the song as they hear it or sing the tune with their own voice in terms of the arrangements we often make changes to the guitar and bass parts in order to make gameplay more interesting in
515890 theres at least a half dozen other bands waiting in the wings to see what happens with this case
515891 what they did was file for a preliminary injunction over the thanksgiving holiday trying to disrupt sales of guitar hero on a theory that just doesnt hold water
515892 in some cases its karaoke except with the original band members
515893 other times theyll go back to the original to get the vibe but go for something new with aerosmith the vocals and guitar and every sound is different we didnt go for retro we wanted it different for
515894 we had re recorded the song a couple years earlier because we did a commercial for napa auto parts but we couldnt close the deal at the time and so we had a great multitrack of the song sitting on the shelf guitar hero needed it we were ready
515895 well i gave you a chance you know in fact i gave you a lot of chances
515896 this blog has made me really really sad maybe im getting my love karma now when i was at uni i had a wonderful boyfriend who adored me it was warm and comfy with just the occasional stomach flip i thought there should be more when he wasnt around i looked for more one day one day when i wasnt even looking i found more 24hr a day stomach dropping love at first sight in love ness more with a man with smiling eyes who wanted to dance with me and w4wowsies he could dance my boyfriend said if hed known that dancing was that important to me he could have danced with me but i didnt want a man to dance with me because i wanted him to but to do that because that was who he was i shake my head a man to dance with me when i want him to would be more than adequate today i broke up with the boyfriend and went with the love at first sight dancing man at the time i wished it was possible to have both but of course it isnt and the dancing man was very jealous possessive insecure the dancing man stopped dancing after a while eventually he felt trapped in a commitment where he stayed out of duty and responsibility but he was no longer in love and no longer able to be true to himself a few months back a man did pass by peeked in and smiled at what he saw the smiling man i left my door open hoping hed keep coming back but time has passed and i think maybe he has headed off down the hall looking for other open doors right now i just want to shut mine and never open it again and maybe thats fair because i hurt someone once who i dont believe would ever have said no to me he begged me not to go and sometimes i wonder what might have been if id listened to him maybe i do deserve to be where i am now or maybe i deserve to learn from what ive lived and strive to love better

515900 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period

515934 now on a personal note when i was asked what it means to be a woman running for president i always gave the same answer that i was proud to be running as a woman but i was running because i thought id be the best president but i am a woman and like millions of women i know there are still barriers and biases out there often unconscious i want to build an america that respects and embraces the potential of every last one of us i ran as a daughter who benefited from opportunities my mother never dreamed of i ran as a mother who worries about my daughters future and a mother who wants to lead all children to brighter tomorrows to build that future i see we must make sure that women and men alike understand the struggles of their grandmothers and mothers and that women enjoy equal opportunities equal pay and equal respect let us resolve and work toward achieving some very simple propositions there are no acceptable limits and there are no acceptable prejudices in the twenty first century you can be so proud that from now on it will be unremarkable for a woman to win primary state victories unremarkable to have a woman in a close race to be our nominee unremarkable to think that a woman can be the president of the united states and that is truly remarkable
515935 there is a clear consensus that there is no real consensus on what cloud computing is
515936 our speakers put cloud computing in its historical context from the cambrian explosion all the way through the rise of electric utilities they showed how businesses today can use this emerging technology for cost effective and powerful computing solutions and they also gave us a feel for the real paradigm shift the cloud could bring to the computing world especially how large software companies might find themselves vulnerable to disruption although some firms are still in denial about this

515954 when precise diagnosis isnt possible then treatment must be provided through what we call intuitive medicine where highly trained and expensive professionals solve medical problems through intuitive experimentation and pattern recognition as patterns in these patients become clearer care evolves into the realm of evidence based or empirical medicine where data is amassed to show that certain ways of treating patients are on average better than others only when diseases are diagnosed precisely however can therapy that is predictably effective for each patient be developed and standardized we term this domain precision medicine
515955 the delivery of care has been frozen in two business models the general hospital and the physicians practice which were designed a hundred years ago when almost all care was in the realm of intuitive medicine what causes products and services to become more affordable and accessible is the delivery of the technological enabler through disruptive business models it is due to the lack of business model innovation in the healthcare industry in many cases because regulators have not permitted it that we are fast becoming unable to afford healthcare
515956 the health care system has trapped many disruption enabling technologies in high cost institutions that have conflated two and often three business models under the same roof
515957 the situation screams for business model innovation the first wave of innovation must separate different business models into separate institutions whose resources processes and profit models are matched to the nature and degree of precision by which the disease is understood solution shops need to become focused so they can deliver and price the services of intuitive medicine accurately focused value adding process hospitals need to absorb those procedures that historically general hospitals have performed after definitive diagnosis and user networks need to be cultivated to manage the care of many behavior dependent chronic diseases solution shops and vap hospitals can be created as hospitals within hospitals if done correctly the reason why this basic division must occur at beginning however is that it will enable accurate measurements of value costs pricing and profit
515958 disruptions are rarely plug compatible into the prior commercial system when disruptive innovators assume that relying on the existing commercial system is a cheaper faster way to succeed they invariably find that the old commercial system kills their innovation or co opts and re shapes their disruptive business model so that it conforms to the system vice versa never happens piecemeal attempts at disruption leave the forces of reform mired in their trenches working solely on their individual pieces of the problem inserting their improvements into the existing system but never enabling a new disruptive commercial system to arise
515959 the ideal entity responsible for healthcare should have a long term horizon strong motivations to keep people healthy and the ability to make care convenient who might that be
515960 doctors and hospitals make money when people get sick but employers make money when their employees are healthy and productive even though many of them say they want to be freed from the burden of paying for employees health care if you watch what major employers are doing they are investing heavily to attract train and retain the best employees possible as a result employers increasingly are integrating backwards to contract directly with hospitals and clinics themselves cutting insurance companies out of the decision making loop

515976 he showed up he threw on some gear and he took the time to come out and catch my bullpen
515977 that was a classy move especially by an 18 year veteran
515978 hes been great he was working with me and kept saying i am with you i am there with you

516000 well its not really my area but if you want to hang on ill talk to somebody in that area
516001 well we think we may have found whats happened and we think that maybe something has gone missing off our system were not sure but we will look into it in the meantime if the due date for payment is getting close you might want to contact us again
516002 you mean that there may be a problem in centrelinks system and that if that is the case then the payment notices were incorrectly issued
516003 you will need to talk to the child support agency about that

516021 i think we over finessed the footy i thought we turned the ball over when we were in control and they sweated on our mistakes
516022 its probably the most frustrated ive been all season on performance i thought we had enough of the ball to hurt adelaide and we gave it back and paid the price

516048 this large epidemiological study shows for the first time a consistent and robust association between a high blood level of alkaline phosphatase and cardiovascular death in thousands of dialysis patients across the united states
516049 if the association between alkaline phosphatase and mortality has a causal link treatment strategies that reduce alkaline phosphatase levels may improve survival in patients with ckd chronic kidney disease and probably in many other patients with chronic diseases and active bone disorders
516050 in dialysis patients increased levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood indicate a so called high turnover bone disease which can happen due to hormonal imbalance in ckd
516051 alkaline phosphatase has recently been shown to be associated with increased vascular calcification in experimental studies our study shows the clinical manifestation of this association in real world patients
516052 the results of our study suggest that treatment to eradicate h pylori reduces the risk of developing new gastric carcinoma in patients who have a history of such disease and are thus at risk for developing further gastric cancers we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
516053 yet worldwide gastric cancer kills more people and there is better evidence that h pylori eradication can prevent mortality than there is for colonoscopy screening preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
516054 perhaps the most alarming issue we are seeing with black henna tattoos is the increase in the number of children even children as young as four who are getting them and experiencing skin reactions
516055 kids make up a significant portion of the population that receives temporary tattoos because parents mistakenly think they are safe since they are not permanent and are available at so many popular venues catering to families in fact nothing could be further from the truth
516056 each exposure to ppd re challenges the immune system so each time you get a black henna tattoo or use a hair dye that contains ppd there is an increased risk of having a reaction
516057 many people are sensitized to ppd but dont have a reaction to it however each time you are exposed to black henna you increase your risk of developing a lifelong allergy to it
516058 unless the artist can tell you exactly whats in the tattoo dont get one
516059 the use of cannabis as a therapeutic agent in multiple sclerosis is controversial
516060 the potential risks of smoked cannabis in this population had not been studied previously
516061 slowness of thought and memory disturbance affect about one half of multiple sclerosis patients as it is
516062 patients also have high rates of psychological difficulties such as major depression which at the extreme end of the spectrum may lead to suicidality
516063 the finding that regular use of street cannabis by multiple sclerosis patients is associated with yet further cognitive and psychiatric problems is therefore of particular concern

516119 god created men in the image of god for god
516120 god did not create men in the image of the beast for the beast
516121 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened
516122 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence sic of their error which was meet

516127 i knew what to expect after hearing her sing in that shower scene in elf
516128 i actually was given some offers to record after elf but i didnt want to do just any old record
516129 a lot of people wanted me to make an album of standards but i didnt want to do that or do anything that could be construed as a vanity project i waited till i found somebody i really wanted to work with
516130 if the songs were not good if the singer was not good if the production was bad any of that would be a great sign this was just a vanity project
516131 i never worried because i knew i was very sincere about this and my intentions were pure i totally put myself out there with this record as long as that was the case i knew it could cut through whatever peoples assumptions might be
516132 its another creative outlet but its something more than that
516133 i just felt like i was going to burst like i had so many songs in me i needed to get them out
516134 they were really elementary lo fi recordings but they sounded great to me that way with just vocals and piano in this really raw form
516135 i knew once i heard the songs and the vocals that it would be a great record her vocals are very classic sounding a vintage quality that you dont hear often listening to the demos reminded of some of my favorite ronettes songs and brian wilson productions i heard things like that in her demos her songs lend themselves to the listeners imagination
516136 theres nothing else ive ever done that was so pure an expression of myself
516137 being an actor can be frustrating because you dont have control over what you put out there i mean i love the work its fun but its always doing someone elses work its the writers words and the directors vision
516138 with this i got to see it from the very start writing the songs in my room to recording and mixing it was amazing
516139 it definitely can burn you out doing movie after movie so im extra excited about this tour
516140 probably wont be out until 2010 or 2011 everyone is so busy
516141 we worked well together so im sure well do it again she told me the favorite films that she has done were where the director trusted the actors to work from improvisation to be able to trust the people you work with inside and outside the studio thats the best framework for creating something interesting

516154 come over and play in new york like its candyland
516155 people with more modest incomes who wouldnt just walk up and say hey let me get a table if theyre back home in london where its too expensive to go to boujis

516168 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
516169 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
516170 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

516214 heck rule for deferred accrual is called into play only when there exists a conviction or sentence that has not been
516215 it is within the power of the district court and in accord with common practice to stay the civil action until the criminal case or the likelihood of a criminal case is ended
516216 before the setting aside of indeed even before the existence of the related criminal conviction
516217 raises the question whether assuming that the heck bar takes effect when the later conviction is obtained the statute of limitations on the once valid cause of action is tolled as long as the heck bar subsists
516218 nevertheless in exercising that discretion trial courts should seek to balance the need for effective trial management with the duty to create an adequate record and allow legitimate inquiry
516219 ive had some meaningful innings in my life but with the whole situation and for the people back home its bigger than just us this victory
516220 weve all just witnessed a very very special innings the way graeme smith came out and played was as good as ive seen anyone chase down that sort of target under that sort of pressure
516221 i dont understand whats wrong with bike sex what if its a really nice gary fisher and youre just totally enthused over the fact that you own one why cant you bust a nut on the handle bars without feeling guilty i usually like to fuck my bike in 18th gear because i can stroke it slower when youre in 5th or higher youve got to pump way too fast its too hard to enjoy it that way and you get tired

516233 our hitting responded today and we did what we needed to do to win i think the young kids saw what it was all about friday and they stepped up today
516234 it just wasnt meant to be the last couple of days
516235 we just couldnt get anything going and we left too many runners on base unfortunately thats the way it happened
516236 they came out aggressive and cross wasnt able to get into any kind of rhythm
516237 before we knew it they had five runs on the board and that was the game but carson is 16 years old and he has three more years left at this level along with some of the other kids this experience will be valuable down the road
516238 we played hard the whole time but sometimes you dont get the breaks
516239 we made a nice run to get here and it seemed like everything went our way just to get to the tournament we feel like we can compete with anyone but we had a couple of rough innings that got to us
516240 i think during the winning streak we just played relaxed and when we came here we were all tense and we didnt pay attention to the small things
516241 we were trying to do too much trying to tie that game with one swing of the bat
516242 it is a very unique experience to have a merger this large in fact its probably the largest thats occurred in the state and one of the few largest in the country
516243 theres not a st marys system anymore theres not a baptist system anymore
516244 we are the mercy health partners system now were a new family and today is a step in that journey
516245 we stopped at first baptist church because thats a historic church as far as the development of the hospital
516246 we feel like together were going to be able to be stronger going into the future
516247 were going to be able to maintain our healthcare ministry that focuses on the total person mind body and spirit

516305 is it likely that a father would have dared proceed in the same way with an adult son and received such ready acquiescence from the courts and a good part of the media no fathers have appeared to take legal charge of the countless male pill popping pop stars whose language and behaviour are less than clean and who live out some of the wildest dreams of the adult children we all sometimes are but women it seems like their victorian great grandmothers still need to be taken in hand and charged with madness

516322 common reaction is to wonder how someone can identify themselves as male and yet embrace pregnancy
516323 like saying you cant be a woman and have a career
516324 of course the reason that the story has gotten so much attention is because beatie doubly upsets the expectations of a society that is still quite rigid about gender conformity if transitioning from male to female or female to male is still hard for some to accept then folks who fall somewhere in between or as seems to be the case here are not threatened by forays across the gender divide totally confound the concept that beatie doesnt feel like being pregnant threatens his identity as a man seems to be difficult to understand for those who are still not entirely comfortable even with those who break down gender roles such as a female boss a stay at home dad etc let alone challenge the concept of gender as a simple binary divided by an impenetrable wall
516325 the only unusual challenges these kids face come from members of the public who see gender ambiguity as a great wrong
516326 generally speaking a man whose desire for a child is strong enough to overcome the obstacles that transgender men must face in bearing one is likely to be an extremely caring father

516350 we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later to leave the strongest possibility of remaining in some kind of fellowship
516351 the most unhealthy thing would be to allow the debate to continue for a long time
516352 we would have only ourselves to blame if more of the provinces go their own way
516353 the vast majority want to take steps towards restoring communion but a smaller group base the language of communion on feelings what it means to me what can i get from it
516354 a major question is how we move towards that point the highest degree of fellowship whilst allowing for an orderly separation

516399 yes cause well i am part of that past you want to mmm let go of and im sure as hell i aint gonna be part of your near future so my lord will thee forget me as i have hurt thee in order to protect my rotten soul and darkest heart and i have seen with glee as you suffered for the love of this white maiden of yours and i did pray for my sister to do that which i cant to snap you out of your dream and take you back to be well you and perhaps it was jealousy perhaps it was just madness or maybe something deeper that turned my blood against you but we have forgiven all that and we have mmm permitted each other to we may say walk their own path but well it may be a girls thing but i need to know will thee bid me farewell and forget about me north of the river contemplating to jump from the cliff will you forget about the child with hair of gold and black which was really red but no one was able to see will your memories of calyx virago go numb and clouded will you ever forget that i was the first girl you told you loved her true you loved nathalie in a much more deeper and almost religious way and im certain you cheated on me as a manner of speaking cause well we all cheated ourselves among us but you were the first guy to tell me you loved me and i need to know i will not ask if you love me because i know our hearts will need a little bit more time to answer that but will you remember me even if it is the painful memory of watching me swim naked in calyx virago even if it is the certainty that i woke the hungry and lustful beast
516400 ill always remember the good times and yes hurtful as it may be ill always remember calyx virago but above all ill always remember that i loved you
516401 i loved you once more than once i did love you farthel maybe when we were too young to understand what love really is and true you were never the most handsome man not the brightest not the funniest but i loved you when i was too young to understand it or why
516402 and you said you loved me and i believed so when you did
516403 my point we should have supported each other much more that what we did i shouldve stood for you and you shouldnt have let me fall but we did and at some point we screwed it all and now you are truly in love and i dont know if thats a pity or a joy cause now i know but it is too late goodbye

516447 nothing succeeds in overcoming shyness as does experiencing social successes if the child or adult takes the initial risk of engaging in some social activity shyness correlates with empathic concern on measures of empathy and youngsters emotional responsiveness may promote compassion for others parents who are supportive of a childs temperament but not overprotective appear to facilitate overcoming an initial inhibition in new and developmentally challenging situations overprotected children however are more at risk for anxious self preoccupation which interferes with taking others perspectives another aspect of empathy that becomes increasingly important as children become adults

516475 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
516476 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

516485 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
516486 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
516487 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
516488 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
516489 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
516490 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
516491 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
516492 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
516493 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
516494 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
516495 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
516496 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
516497 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
516498 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
516499 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
516500 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
516501 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
516502 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
516503 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
516504 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
516505 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
516506 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
516507 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
516508 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
516509 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
516510 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
516511 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
516512 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
516513 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
516514 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
516515 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
516516 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
516517 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
516518 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
516519 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
516520 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
516521 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
516522 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
516523 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
516524 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
516525 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
516526 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
516527 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
516528 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
516529 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
516530 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
516531 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
516532 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
516533 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
516534 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
516535 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
516536 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
516537 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
516538 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
516539 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
516540 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight

516553 but there is no reason to stop this deal from happening

516611 autumnal nothing to do with leaves it is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day brown is creeping up on us take my word for it russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses deep shining ochres burnt umber and parchments of baked earth reflecting on itself and through itself filtering the light at such times perhaps coincidentally the leaves might fall somewhere

516619 ha sido un buen d a para nosotros porque ganamos un partido muy duro ante un rival que ya est preparado f sicamente para jugar la liga alemana hicimos un buen encuentro
516620 hemos ganando un partido dif cil porque el rival lleva m s tiempo entrenando que nosotros siempre es importante ganar estos partidos ante buenos equipos

516622 es la primera vez que juego en un estadio tan hist rico y he acabado muy contento

516627 todays situation is that neither the return of palestinians refugees nor formation of a palestinian government and even the collapse of the zionist regime is an unachievable aim
516628 the zionist regimehas lost the philosophy of its existence and is no longer capable of implementing the policies of the united states and europe in the region

516631 so the eco challenge guest judge natalie portman is a good style icon i think the interesting thing about natalie first off in todays world to find the balance of someone whos stylish and very chic and very smart all at a young age and able to really express herself about everything including fashion i thought she was really a fabulous addition to our pantheon of guest judges and also particularly in this instance to talk about eco fashion which i think for her is very very personal but shes one of those girls she doesnt want to give up being stylish so she wants the best of both worlds so i think she was really a great addition and i think this is something that i as a designer and everyone as designers right now is dealing with how do we make something that is dealing with eco friendly fabrics without it making you look like johnny appleseed

516633 la permanencia o no de un funcionario depende de si se desempe a honestamente o laboriosamente y ese es un resorte exclusivo del presidente de la naci n es la presidenta por un gobierno republicano la que decide su permanencia o no
516634 en los pa ses vecinos donde los salarios son menores a los de la argentina se registran precios de alimentos mayores y la inflaci n sin embargo da menos
516635 ustedes se preguntar n si volver a a impulsar la resoluci n 125 y yo dir a que s porque creo que por primera vez desde el advenimiento de le democracia las instituciones el poder ejecutivo y el parlamento nos hemos puesto a discutir en serio una ley que por primera vez tocaba el tema de la redistribuci n del ingreso es un debate que creo que es vital y se ha disparado una discusi n que va a seguir el problema de la concentraci n de la riqueza va a exigir instrumentos son discusiones que hay que despojarlas de un sesgo ideol gico cuando se personaliza demasiado una discusi n no se quiere abordar el n cleo del problema cuando debatamos estos temas no hay que personalizar
516636 mi autocr tica es la ingenuidad que tuve frente a la reacci n de los sectores chicos num ricamente pero muy poderosos econ micamente tuvimos la posibilidad de debatir un proyecto de distribuci n de la riqueza en serio y cuando uno ve la pel cula completa ve que los que se beneficiaron con el resultado fueron los sectores exportadores no los peque os y medianos productores
516637 es curioso c mo cuando uno vio algunas votaciones sectores que siempre se han ubicado en el campo progresista finalmente terminaron votando intereses diferentes sobre todo porque era la primera oportunidad hist rica de discutir democr ticamente un proyecto de redistribuci n del ingreso en serio cuando era senadora siempre presentaban proyectos a la izquierda de todo el todo el mundo tal vez porque sab an que no lo bamos a poder tratar pero esas son observaciones an lisis lecciones que no solamente las debo hacer yo sino toda la sociedad cuando mira a sus representantes
516638 debo ser sincera como en todas mis actitudes de vida volver a a hacer todas y cada una de las cosas que hice
516639 en 2003 los comentarios eran que esta se ora era la que iba a mandar a decidir porque en realidad kirchner era un pelele que iba a ser manejado o por el ex presidente o por su mujer suced a eso porque l era desconocido en buenos aires y yo muy conocida as que ahora es una inversi n ahora yo soy d bil manejable pusil nime pero no es cierta ninguna de las dos historias
516640 hoy me enter por los medios que la ltima conferencia fue en 1999 quiere decir que todo aquello que hab amos o do se debe a un error de informaci n parece ser que no s lo el anterior presidente no dio conferencias de prensa
516641 vamos por la historia del sistema ferroviario en la argentina sabemos que hab a sido devastado ramal que para ramal que cierra estamos haciendo una gran inversi n para el tren bala no se extrae dinero del ambito ferroviario no se saca un solo centavo del presupuesto nacional para este tren creo que el tren bala ser importante es financiado absolutamente por la empresa que lo construye este tema tiene como limitante el tema de la tarifa que se cobra si el boleto fuera de 3 4 pesos ser a m s facil pero tenemos que equilibrar las posibilidades del usuario si vas a londres viaj s fant stico pero pagas cinco libras por doce cuadras
516642 siempre esa agenda del bicentenario estuvo abierta para todos los sectores econ micos y sociales que articulan lo que debe ser un nuevo modelo m s all de las adjetivaciones lo importante es tener en cuenta que la unidad no pasa por la homogeneidad sino en poder articular un modelo de reindustrializaci n el gran desaf o de todos los sectores es generar un modelo que agregando valor siga dando trabajo a los argentinos mejorando el salario e incorporando tecnolog a sin lugar a dudas est n todos convocados sin temor al debate
516643 hemos mantenido m ltiples reuniones con distintas entidades si uno analiza la actual ley de radiodifusi n uno ve que se hizo durante la dictadura cuando lo m s moderno era la televisi n a color ni siquiera hab a fax creo que la argentina requiere de un instrumento que de cuenta de preparar el marco regulatorio para la incorporaci n de la tecnolog a la comunicaci n es el rea que ha dado el salto mas importante en materia de innovaci n tecnol gica y nuestra idea es convocar o seguir convocando para trabajar en una nueva ley
516644 el banco central se maneja de manera aut noma no hay un tipo de cambio presidencial debe seguir manej ndose en la forma en que se ha venido manejando ya que ha permitido acumulaci n de reservas y le ha dado solidez a todo el sistema financiero nacional
516645 es in dita la presencia de una delegaci n como la que acompa a al presidente lula en la argentina este fin de semana lo cual revela la firme convicci n de lula y m a de integraci n y la importancia de argentina como un lugar para inversiones por su competitividad en la ronda de doha tuvimos posturas diferentes con brasil cuando uno compara lo que ponen los pa ses desarrollados frente a nosotros no suena a buen negocio para los pa ses emergentes en el caso de argentina nos colocaba en una posici n muy dif cil es muy importante para la integraci n tambi n la presencia de venezuela y tiene que ver con esta ecuaci n energ tica alimentos e industria hay que adoptar pol ticas de estado permanentes
516646 el club de par s es un tema que nos ocupa
516647 cualquier especulaci n sobre la hora y el d a elegidos para la conferencia
516648 la decisi n de esta conferencia de prensa fue de la presidenta y esperamos que podamos hacer algunas m s
516649 claro que animo a las parejas casadas a rezar para que tengan una buena y feliz vida sexual para ellos es un medio de acercarse a dios
516650 la gente est un poco sorprendida al principio pero agradablemente sorprendida
516651 si crees en dios crees que dios est presente en la vida en el amor en el matrimonio y en la sexualidad parece natural hablar de sexo y suprimir algunos tab es y etiquetas del pecado
516652 el amor de una pareja casada expresado en el sexo acerca el cuerpo humano al cielo el xtasis de una relaci n sexual puede compararse a la alegr a de la vida eterna
516653 por eso este acto conyugal permite a los esposos empezar a entender la dulzura del encuentro con dios
516654 no necesit is padecer una enfermedad del coraz n para ser cardi logo ni ser alcoh lico para convertirse en terapeuta
516655 a partir de las 9 de la ma ana nos juntamos los correligionarios en san carlos a hacer un apoyo como radicales que somos

516657 es la tercera reuni n que se viene realizando a nivel provincial que despu s de esta intervenci n nosotros como radicales vamos a salir fortalecidos ese es el compromiso

516666 creemos que se puede dar una propuesta de soluci n afirm la mandataria pero destac que el proceso para renegociar la deuda debe dejar espacio para que el pa s siga creciendo
516667 aqu hay un r gimen administrado por la autonom a del banco central no hay un tipo de cambio presidencial
516668 tenemos un sistema de administraci n muy sano en materia cambiaria y una solidez financiera en un mundo de tanta turbulencia a partir de la crisis de las hipotecas
516669 tiene una acumulaci n de reservas en el banco central y una solidez en el sistema financiera
516670 no se destinar un s lo centavo del presupuesto nacional para el proyecto
516671 le aclaro que nada tiene que ver con el ex ministro
516672 qu opini n se puede tener sobre los aspectos m s terribles de la condici n humana es conmocionante
516673 no conozco puntualmente el caso en cuanto la condena y causa le en los diarios que no funcion la pulsera pero resumir el hecho en eso me parece reduccionista
516674 no creo que haya sucedido porque no funcion la pulsera lamentablemente yo creo que el hecho hubiese ocurrido igual por el grado de perversi n que tiene una persona capaz de hacer eso
516675 se habla de c digos blandos y duros de modificaciones de las leyes pero los jueces tienen facultades para negar excarcelaciones teniendo en cuenta la peligrosidad del delincuente

516744 theyve been in school for 8 years with the non muslims they come into islamic schools with ideas about dating makeup and so forth we cant have that
516745 oh so now its a problem now that you have a teen
516746 well quakers arent so bad lets see what the tuition is ack
516747 hey wed um like to expand to 12th grade but we dont have enough money to pay our staff as it is
516748 we follow the same curriculum as the public school that you didnt want to send your kids to in the first place because were mainstream and moderate
516749 why do islamic school people dislike teens so much why is my kid left out in the cold

516757 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
516758 it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a helper fit for him
516759 therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife and they shall become one flesh
516760 god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good
516761 for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
516762 whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
516763 therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife and the two shall become one flesh that was from genesis now his explanation this mystery is profound and i am saying that it refers to christ and the church
516764 husbands love your wives as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
516765 wives submit to your own husbands as to the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church his body and is himself its savior
516766 its the proudest day of my life as a teacher and a football coach to see andre receive this honor especially because i not only coached him but he was also in my english class
516767 it was such a difficult life tippett had in newark he never wanted to leave the gym even after practice was over he would stick around until 10 oclock at night shooting hoops hes one of the most intense and motivated individuals ive ever coached and been around i love him like a son
516768 it was one of the best things that ever happened because he needed that discipline he never missed a day of practice after that
516769 this is truly the greatest experience of my life as a coach im so proud its the greatest day of my life as a coach
516770 no one asks journalists if they do it for the money or just because they love their laptops
516771 we had some discussion about a larger tire several years ago with nascar when we started this whole discussion about the car of tomorrow
516772 but obviously weve been working with the current size on the car of tomorrow this spring we decided to ramp that new program up
516773 we are working on a larger contain air volume a bigger section width taller tire larger bead diameter
516774 right now its all modeling were trying to figure out what the right size would be
516775 that was the most pathetic racing tire ive ever been on in my professional career
516776 we met with him during the free agency period and we were all impressed with him
516777 we know a good deal about him were probably a little bit fortunate and lucky that hes available
516778 oppose a political view but dont try to suppress it
516779 its certainly a black eye for the industry but unfortunately altercations on the field are part of the game
516780 it certainly wont deter me from continuing to go to minor league baseball games
516781 i think its just good baseball at its purest form
516782 i dont think the sport of baseball can mandate cultural behavior but i think baseball does a wonderful job of setting a good example by and large day in and day out
516783 minor league baseball is sort of a beacon of family entertainment
516784 i think its important to be very punitive in terms of disciplinary measures if anything happens that takes away from that aspect of minor league baseball
516785 but its so rare and few and far between that i dont think it would be a concern in the long term
516786 the mystique and allure of the t206 wagner card continues to grow

516790 were running against a celebrity he is someone who gathered throngs of fans overseas
516791 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings but we hope hell reconsider
516792 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
516793 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
516794 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
516795 weve got to make sure we keep focused on peoples day to day concerns we dont take the skill of the republicans in engaging in negative campaigning lightly
516796 dad suspected in daughters kidnapping in custody girl said safe
516797 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back

516800 god created the chicken and the chicken laid the egg
516801 to have him teaching science at a respectable school is about equivalent to having a flat earther teaching geography
516802 could be discussed in schools in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution
516803 what is not fine is to say there are these two theories one is called evolution the other is called genesis if you are going to say that then you should talk about the nigerian tribe who believe the world was created from the excrement of ants
516804 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
516805 i was shocked by how some put up barriers to understanding
516806 i showed them the evidence and they just said this is what it says in my holy book and so i asked if your holy book says one thing but the evidence says something else you then go with your holy book and they said yes and i said why and they said its the way weve been brought up
516807 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with
516808 the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multi culturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing
516809 i would like to see evolution taught a lot earlier there should be no problem teaching it to eight year olds
516810 for parents to deprive their children of an educational opportunity because of a traditional bigotry is unfair on the child
516811 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist
516812 its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
516813 i have a lot of time for the church of england
516814 i feel rather sorry for them in a way compared to the alternatives it is a thoroughly decent organisation and if all christians were like rowan there wouldnt be a problem ive met him socially and he is delightful
516815 when i go to dinner with a bishop i find them very often extremely often very convivial nice people why ever not
516816 often when you talk to bishops it appears they dont believe in very much
516817 it would appear he does believe in it the virgin birth
516818 but he doesnt thrust it down peoples throats his kind of anglicanism is benign and pretty harmless
516819 because we are all brought up to respect faith it leaves open a gap through which fanatics can charge
516820 yes i think we have all been brought up to give too much respect to religion as opposed to any other kind of opinion
516821 well we devote our lives to writing books composing music creating poetry all higher functions of the brain if we were following darwinian dictates we males would be spending all our time fighting other males to get females and screwing them all over the place in order to have lots of children and grandchildren im very glad we have risen above all of that
516822 i am patient with stupidity but not with those who are proud of it
516823 the so called christian nations are the most enlightened and progressive but in spite of their religion not because of it the church has opposed every innovation and discovery from the day of galileo down to our own time when the use of anesthetic in childbirth was regarded as a sin because it avoided the biblical curse pronounced against eve and every step in astronomy and geology ever taken has been opposed by bigotry and superstition the greeks surpassed us in artistic culture and in architecture five hundred years before christian religion was born

516829 wij bouwen voor het laagsegment en dan moet je geen dure dingen invoeren die de klant niet wenst
516830 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
516831 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
516832 daar liggen onze kansen en daarom durfde ik deze beslissing te nemen er is duidelijk nog vraag naar degelijke maar toch betaalbare boten
516833 het is een leuk bedrijf een prachtig product en we hebben een erg vriendelijke klantenkring
516834 toen mijn eerste boot te water ging kneep ik hem wel even ik was bang dat ik niet alles goed had gelast en dat de boot zou zinken later werd dat gelukkig minder
516835 wanneer vrienden eerlijk aan me vroegen of ik het zag zitten reageerde mijn vrouw en ik altijd zo overtuigend dat ik wist dat het goed zat
516836 this little one isnt worth the effort come let me get you something

517053 anyone who likes to chat with you is a friend
517054 most of them except a 100 or so but how does it matter
517055 i have their contact address and phone numbers and they often call me for investment advice plus how often does one get to meet ones real friends anyway
517056 you are never lonely and someone somewhere is always there to chat you can share as much as you want and then drop out of your friends lives
517057 online friends are less demanding and maintaining relationships with them is much easier than real friends
517058 i wouldnt share personal information with them but they are my friends all the same
517059 they bring me business and a few of them have also turned into real close pals

517086 siddhivinayak temple has a huge following in mumbai and the temple trust was interested in getting the devotees involved in the film so we approached many of them and everyone readily agreed
517087 we are going to show six or seven miraculous stories authorised by the temple trust in one of them sachin has an important part towards climax of the story
517088 we decided to make this film because several devotees said more people should know about lord ganesh
517089 a scientific manner and it is not a superstitious account
517090 lord ganesh worshipped his parents a lot and devotees should implement that
517091 he wants the best and he wants to relate to us that there are some things that hes not going to bend on
517092 there are definitely some rules that hes just not going to let people slide on because the integrity of the game is bigger than each person that plays the game and you have to maintain that
517093 if you look back at that period in time it kind of overlapped the 80s and the 90s and i kind of felt like that may have hurt them
517094 i was hoping more people would be recognized and i hope a number of other guys get in too
517095 i have strong feelings about this in part because i played for him
517096 he had no ego had great common sense and had an intensity for the game he was extremely creative and fostered things that are still in todays game because he was so creative i think hes affected a lot of coaches and id like to see him get in
517097 i hope it doesnt take him 13 years to get in
517098 i have an idea of what i want to do and it will definitely be part of a nice package for my wife
517099 i want all of the hall of famers to come back for it because this is where i did it it takes time to work some of these things out because everyone has a busy schedule
517100 you know it took me six years to get in here it may take me six more years to get it done again
517101 i got to go against him one on one in practice
517102 his greatest skill was his nasty and relentless desire to play football on game day he was an inspiration for his teammates
517103 hes a guy i watched a lot and i thought he was one of the best ive ever seen

517180 wow someone has a lot of anger in them then i remembered how rashaan writes with the extra question marks so i assume this was from his lips on her name but i could be wrong they are both flipping nuts and almost exactly alike so it could have been her too i never got any paperwork on a divorce otherwise i would have reviewed it and started fixing the mistakes he would have added and signed the fucking thing so i could move on with my life its sad to me that she is so jealous of whatever it is she is jealous of a friggin 30 year old lady butting her head in business she has no real part of and trying to make me feel bad about my life decisions i left rashaan because he was worthless doing nothing to help the family and doing nothing to support me as a wife we were in love the first 3 years then something snapped in him and things went all down hill he became manic talking about his beliefs that he was really jesus and god which is sort of contradictory anyways then i allowed him to stay home and care for the kids while i went out to work everyday and dealt with centurytels bullshit and then come home to a house that was destroyed and the kids were left to do everything for themselves bullshit is what it was and i grew tired of it and told him i needed some help he could stay home and do nothing but play music and games while i worked as long as the house was decent and the kids were taken care of he couldnt grasp the idea pathetic he laid in bed till 2 in the afternoon got up fixed the kids something and went away into his studio to piddle around unexceptable so in conclusion i think it is sad she was trying to look into my private life read my thoughts what does she want to learn something from me she mentioned above that they were happy and to deal with it um okay who the hell ever said i had any issues with that i am glad they are together two nuts in a basket i never once have looked back to rashaan and thought
517181 wow i am so glad to be away from him
517182 what else is there about the wnba that i dont know about and is amusing enough to base a post around

517195 it certainly wont deter me from continuing to go to minor league baseball games
517196 i think its just good baseball at its purest form
517197 i dont think the sport of baseball can mandate cultural behavior but i think baseball does a wonderful job of setting a good example by and large day in and day out
517198 minor league baseball is sort of a beacon of family entertainment
517199 i think its important to be very punitive in terms of disciplinary measures if anything happens that takes away from that aspect of minor league baseball
517200 but its so rare and few and far between that i dont think it would be a concern in the long term
517201 theres a lot of folks who dont have health insurance or just dont have the money period to access dentistry and this is just our way of giving back to the community a little bit on one day out of the year

517278 i grew tobacco some years ago my children grew up and they do not want to continue this business so i gave up this and started to work as a taxi driver
517279 i gave up growing tobacco four years ago it is a very hard and not profitable work only uigurs are still busy with this kind of business and some kazakhs who prefer to hire immigrants
517280 you have to examine each leaf in order to identify its quality and sort we had separated tobacco into three kinds of sorts until this year now i have a contract with philip morris and they pointed out to sort tobacco leaves into nine quality levels
517281 proceeds of this harvest will not be enough for living this year anyway we have cows and with these property we will manage to live
517282 we raise the problem of increasing prices for tobacco plant every year in government bodies but there are no results
517283 this year company trick us they increased prices for 30 percent than previous year but at the same time they increase the sorts also if farmers get kzt 360 000 from one hectare last year this year they will get same money despite increasing prices as phillip morris pointed out to sort tobacco leaves into nine quality levels
517284 i do not understand the demands of company it will be difficult for high educated specialists to sort out the leaves to nine sort how will simple farmers do it
517285 i cannot change my life because i have been growing tobacco for whole my life and cannot imagine something different i have to work for my daughters future life but my wife and me do not want our daughter to continue this job we wish her to study well and become a good person in future
517286 putin has been vilified by the west but he is still a great leader
517287 russia is well enough off with 40 a barrel oil
517288 the demise of the soviet union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century
517289 the united states has overstepped its borders in all spheres economic political and humanitarian
517290 the number of people who died did not get less but increased we see no kind of restraint

517293 nashis links with the kremlin are well known their leader has met with president putin many times
517294 they forget that britain is no longer a colonial power and that russia was never their colony
517295 now its men from the ministries and agencies and audit chamber claiming back taxes or fines for infringing regulations
517296 its much smaller it is no longer the leader of a bloc the rot has stopped but its military has suffered 20 years of neglect its capability has massively eroded
517297 the americans are circling russia with radars and installing antiballistic missiles close to our borders
517298 nato has assumed responsibility on a global scale for everything that happens the west looks as if its imposing its ideology on others just as the soviet union did fortunately weve recovered from this disease but the bush administration has now caught it
517299 we cant be the dead man at every funeral and the bride at every wedding
517300 thats because the kazakhs and uzbeks and others want aid and technical help and as many uncles as they can get they dont want lectures the eu are doing badly in the region because theyre behaving just like mini americans telling people how to live
517301 it was a different russia a different world when contracts were signed in the 1990s
517302 they were very favourable to foreign investors and bp and shell did not fulfil all their obligations gas prices to ukraine and belarus for example were heavily subsidised that couldnt go on for ever our own gas price will be linked to the european price by 2011
517303 now russia and central asia have become suppliers and india and china have joined the consumers club
517304 theres been a tendency to belittle them and to go on seeing them as the enemy were proud of the history and traditions of our services well so are they and they have every right to be

517316 we are aware of a recent posting on the internet and believe this is a malicious hoax

517320 the word subud and the seven circles symbol are registered trademarks of the world subud association
517321 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
517322 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
517323 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
517324 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
517325 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
517326 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
517327 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
517328 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
517329 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
517330 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
517331 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
517332 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
517333 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
517334 those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances those who give it away those who traffic in it
517335 decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second generation human rights but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance
517336 the evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use
517337 you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems
517338 this would be part of a growing number of countries in latin america where there is either for political or judicial reasons a push toward decriminalization of personal possession sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers
517339 it typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses
517340 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business

517375 shouldnt this be allah and isa but why would a muslim be thanking isa for a meal is there some sufi influence here but that would seem unlikely for a hamas leaders son for islamists especially the salafi sorts usually try to purify their islamic practices of rituals that sufis might observe
517376 i feel that christianity has several aspects its not only a religion but a faith i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god i consider islam a big lie the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
517377 only those christians with whom i met and spent time knew about my decision for years i helped my father the hamas leader and he didnt know that i had converted only that i had christian friends
517378 people with an open mind i liked to walk around among the buildings the restaurants the people to feel the night life i have many friends there whom i would like to see and i dont know whether ill be able to do that at all i mainly miss my mother my brothers and sisters but i know that it will be very difficult for me to return to ramallah soon
517379 i left behind a great deal of property in ramallah in order to achieve true freedom i wanted to get to quiet surroundings that would help me to open the eyes of the muslims and reveal the truth to them about their religion and about christianity to take them out of the darkness and the prison of islam in that way theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east i dont give islam a chance to survive for more than 25 years in the past they scared people and in that way they prevented anti religious publicity but today in the modern age they wont be able to hide the truth any longer
517380 many people will hate me for this interview but im telling them that i love all of them even those who hate me i invite all the people including the terrorists among them to open their hearts and believe now im trying to establish an international organization for young people that will teach about christianity love and peace in the territories too i would like to teach the young people how to love and forgive because thats the only way the two nations can overcome the mistakes of the past and live in peace

517408 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
517409 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
517410 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
517411 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency

517426 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
517427 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
517428 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
517429 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
517430 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
517431 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
517432 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
517433 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water

517435 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works

517455 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
517456 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
517457 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
517458 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
517459 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
517460 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

517463 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
517464 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
517465 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
517466 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
517467 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
517468 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
517469 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
517470 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
517471 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
517472 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
517473 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
517474 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
517475 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes

517477 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car

517481 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
517482 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
517483 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
517484 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
517485 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
517486 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
517487 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
517488 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
517489 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
517490 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
517491 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
517492 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
517493 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
517494 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses

517496 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
517497 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
517498 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
517499 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
517500 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
517501 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
517502 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
517503 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
517504 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
517505 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
517506 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
517507 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
517508 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
517509 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
517510 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
517511 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
517512 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
517513 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
517514 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
517515 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
517516 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
517517 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
517518 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
517519 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
517520 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
517521 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
517522 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
517523 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
517524 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
517525 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
517526 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
517527 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
517528 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
517529 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
517530 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
517531 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
517532 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
517533 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
517534 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
517535 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
517536 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
517537 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
517538 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
517539 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
517540 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
517541 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
517542 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
517543 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
517544 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
517545 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
517546 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
517547 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
517548 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
517549 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
517550 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
517551 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
517552 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
517553 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
517554 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
517555 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
517556 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
517557 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
517558 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
517559 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
517560 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
517561 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
517562 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
517563 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
517564 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
517565 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
517566 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
517567 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
517568 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
517569 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
517570 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
517571 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
517572 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
517573 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
517574 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
517575 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
517576 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
517577 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
517578 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
517579 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
517580 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
517581 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
517582 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
517583 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
517584 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
517585 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
517586 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
517587 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
517588 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
517589 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
517590 linuxs capacity to talk via any medium except smoke signals
517591 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
517592 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
517593 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
517594 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
517595 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
517596 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
517597 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
517598 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
517599 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
517600 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
517601 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
517602 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
517603 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
517604 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
517605 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
517606 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
517607 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
517608 if the vice president says its do able i believe
517609 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
517610 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
517611 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
517612 nos repugna que de juana est en la calle pero creemos en la ley
517613 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
517614 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
517615 enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
517616 thus what gore offered july 17 was not so much a
517617 of course the greatest obstacle to meeting the challenge may be the deep dysfunction of our politics and our self governing system as it exists today in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
517618 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
517619 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
517620 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
517621 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
517622 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
517623 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
517624 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
517625 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
517626 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
517627 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
517628 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
517629 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
517630 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
517631 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
517632 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
517633 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
517634 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
517635 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
517636 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
517637 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
517638 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
517639 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
517640 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
517641 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
517642 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
517643 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
517644 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
517645 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
517646 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
517647 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
517648 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
517649 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
517650 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
517651 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
517652 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
517653 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
517654 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
517655 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
517656 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
517657 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
517658 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
517659 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
517660 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
517661 the poet looks at the world like a man looks at a woman
517662 i wish i had known when i was a teen that girls were waiting at the phone for boys to call
517663 i am going to ask that girl for a date
517664 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
517665 to which restaurant can i take a teenage girl in paris
517666 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
517667 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
517668 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
517669 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
517670 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
517671 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
517672 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
517673 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
517674 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
517675 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
517676 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
517677 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
517678 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
517679 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
517680 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
517681 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
517682 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
517683 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
517684 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
517685 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
517686 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
517687 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
517688 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
517689 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
517690 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
517691 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
517692 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
517693 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
517694 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
517695 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
517696 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
517697 i dont go anywhere i dont party i dont do anything
517698 it makes you really bitter you know someone else is really benefiting from this
517699 it is perhaps a sign of the publics anxiety that many new jerseyans support drilling for oil off our coast as well as elsewhere in the country even though they dont have a lot of confidence it will actually bring down prices
517700 new jerseys coastline is the lifeblood of our economy and a fragile environmental treasure that helps shape our way of life and the governor intends to fight any attempt to jeopardize it
517701 the way to bring down gas prices is to stop speculators from driving up the price of gas force opec to stop hoarding oil and end price gouging
517702 new jersey families desperately need relief from out of control gasoline and energy prices
517703 never would think off shore drilling is a good idea
517704 we should have been doing that for the last 20 years
517705 i think we should invest in off shore drilling and not depend on other countries we might not see the results for some time but youve got to start somewhere
517706 we really have to be self sufficient as far as oil production goes
517707 we have to stop being held hostage by these oil producing countries who set prices arbitrarily i think we have to stop tax breaks for the oil companies in this country
517708 there is no reason why we cant use nuclear energy
517709 everything is up beyond our means all prices theres no middle class its either poor or rich
517710 its a good idea because we wouldnt have to pay the foreign countries for oil or gas wed have our own income without supporting other countries
517711 people are always looking for easy answers to complex problems
517712 because mommy almost hit cars and drove into the grass middle
517713 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
517714 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
517715 ill equipped schools which breed dropouts and which smother motivation
517716 we will neglect our cities to our peril for in neglecting them we neglect the nation
517717 they knew what we must know without knowing a page of it themselves
517718 know what i mean now what it means no water mints
517719 here a short note on swap space encryption with freebsd geom geli 8
517720 an expansion tacoda is not being shut down but we heard from many of tacodas clients because of the relatively small network it had that it wasnt a very scalable solution on its own
517721 given the fact that publishers must take all advertising com ads to get any behavioral targeting tacoda ads with ad com selling all the ads it sounds like aol has abandoned a large fast growing and very profitable market all in the name of functional alignment with a slower growing legacy business
517722 yes everything is being run through the advertising com server which is why we needed to terminate those previous contracts because weve integrated everything under one p amp l but the targeting technology that is being used is tacodas system
517723 all i can is that there were some people who left there were some we asked to leave but we have the entire tacoda engineering team which is based in fort washington pa and they are the key to tacodas product
517724 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
517725 sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons amp dragons
517726 there is no question mr higman greatly benefits from grants and cheap loans from the state and that is his right
517727 the problem starts when he chooses to make that relationship even cozier by becoming one of 35 votes in the state senate that approves government allocations and state budgets
517728 im sure he wants to do gov rounds a big favor after having been so generously rewarded by gov rounds with state contracts cheap loans and government grants
517729 id love to manage again see if i could get back on the wheel again randolph said saturday before participating in the final old timers day at yankee stadium

517733 its a little different a little bit of a transition he said
517734 im a lifer im a grinder i didnt get fired at the end of the season
517735 this is very bad timing but this is what my life has shown me and these are the cards that ive been dealt
517736 with those hard times its when your character really shines through
517737 she accepts the fact that the testing was properly done and the results properly reported
517738 will seek to have her period of suspension reduced substantially
517739 jessica did not knowingly or intentionally take any banned substances
517740 jessica is heartbroken at this turn of events as making the u s olympic team was her cherished dream and proudest moment
517741 she intends to resume her swimming career as soon as possible and to again fulfill her olympic dream in 2012
517742 their faith in her was justified and she will soon give them more reason to be proud of her and her accomplishments
517743 i walked with her for a bit and from her perspective maybe it was unwanted attention but she didnt make that clear
517744 it didnt seem like she was telling me to go away if shed told me to leave id have done so straight away
517745 that was at 12 33pm i know because just a minute before id made a call from my mobile to check how much credit i had left
517746 i know i have done wrong in the past and if i could go back in time and change that i would

517749 i will be vigilant from now on i am never going to give anyone the chance to send me away again i have changed
517750 i think the lesson really is that in considering a case of this complexity the police and those responsible for the prosecution need to keep an open mind as far as possible as to who might be responsible for the crime
517751 i think they did close their mind after the arrest of barry george
517752 if the universe is 13 and 1 2 billion years old why are we the earth only 4 and 1 2 billion years old
517753 activation failed esn is not found do you want to escalate
517754 if this darned machine doesnt move any faster im going to kill something
517755 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical
517756 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
517757 for someone whos been in washington nearly 30 years hes got a pretty slim record on education and when he has taken a stand its been the wrong one
517758 im happy to put my record and ideas up against his any day
517759 concord has come a long way since its launch 10 years ago
517760 we have successfully provided an accessible and affordable option for legal education we have more than 800 graduates across the country who are making their mark on the legal community and in their work places and we are partnering with traditional law schools to provide an online platform to deliver legal education we expect that over the next 10 years concord will continue to redefine legal education in the u s and beyond
517761 the mission of concord law school has been to expand access to a high quality legal education for students who cannot participate in traditional programs
517762 in todays competitive knowledge based global economy it is important that we find ways to meet the needs of adult learners who want to increase their skills and grow professionally
517763 you find that there are many people who are depending on this person who are looking up to this person and who see this persons success as their own success
517764 as you go up the ladder its not always easy to simply say to them ok now im in this new position
517765 a lot of players get in trouble because they want everyone around them to lead the same lifestyle
517766 you buy this big house for people and they no longer want to drive the low end car to go with the big house so the big house leads to the big car to the better clothes to the better restaurants and stuff its a snowball effect you see how guys live
517767 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
517768 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
517769 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
517770 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
517771 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
517772 sen john mccain of arizona is the only republican who promises to end the george bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
517773 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
517774 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
517775 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
517776 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
517777 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment
517778 you might get that base but you wont win the election
517779 it goes back to the old saying dont throw rocks at people who own ink barrels and people have gotten sick and tired of the excuse that all media is liberal
517780 is defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
517781 okay badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
517782 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
517783 i had no odd suspicions about him at all he was a very nice guy he used to come to work every day and pick up his papers and get them to all his customers without any problems
517784 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
517785 and then when i found out in the news that li was being pinned for the brutal attack i was in utter shock
517786 fired mortar rounds at the hamas police as well as a rocket at gaza city
517787 these are lies we never fired rockets or mortar rounds hamas is the one committing crimes we have asked all the palestinian factions islamists and nationalists to use their influence so that these crimes cease
517788 laid siege to our house firing mortar rounds targeting our women and our children
517789 hamass attacks undermine my call for national dialogue between palestinian factions
517790 the iranian nation will not give up a single iota of its nuclear rights
517791 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges
517792 seriously seeking to increase the size of joint investments to more than us 3 billion over the next years
517793 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1
517794 we have witnessed many of the detainees returning from class and sharing notes and thoughts with their compound members
517795 i think part of it is to see how confident he is in himself too and i think that matters beyond the physical stuff so we get a chance to sit down and visit with him
517796 his conversations with head athletic trainer ronnie porterfield have been really good i know that hes very confident hes feeling good about himself we just want to be able to see it in person and move it along from there
517797 really had good at bats last night they said he drew two walks had two really good at bats and took some borderline pitches
517798 just like we set up the rehab assignment all those different ways he was used there we thought might be the different ways we would use him here
517799 it would not be an easy decision about whose place baldelli might take
517800 thats why we really want to know what we have to do and again we still have a couple of more days to figure it out well try to make our best guess at that point
517801 but if rocco is able to play and perform youve all seen what he can do in the past and it sounds like hes performing close to that level again and that makes it very interesting the big problem is the fatigue factor and how much we can use him and how we can use him
517802 they say its right around the corner it seems like everythings going to come at me at the last second the last moment and then itll hit me
517803 i still love the game of baseball the things i accomplished in the game
517804 theres not really a special person that youre really looking forward to seeing but i had a lot of great teammates so im looking forward to seeing all the great teammates
517805 when you first become a yankee youre so proud of being a yankee
517806 i probably want be remembered that if you saw rickey henderson play you know deep inside in his heart he really loved the game
517807 i had a great time out there playing the game
517808 id love to manage again see if i could get back on the wheel again
517809 i grew up here this is where i learned how to be a winner here be a champion here
517810 its a little different a little bit of a transition
517811 im a lifer im a grinder i didnt get fired at the end of the season
517812 a big part of it is my team i brought them back to where they are today that doesnt change
517813 the mystique and allure of the t206 wagner card continues to grow

517818 elections in kirkuk must be held in a way that ensures the rights of all groups
517819 those who called for sharing powers in kirkuk aimed at violating the constitution and we would not allow any form of flouting the constitution voted on by the iraqi people
517820 the kurdish brotherhood list at the kirkuk governorate council held an extraordinary meeting today during which it called for integrating the governorate into kurdistan region considering this demand a constitutional right muhammad khalil al juburi deputy for the arab bloc said that the extraordinary session was illegal muhammad kamal deputy for the kurdish brotherhood list said during the meeting today we presented a request signed by 24 members of the 41 member kirkuk governorate council to make kirkuk part of kurdistan region given this is a constitutional right the request will be later referred to the iraqi council of representatives kamal also called on the political blocs at the council of representatives to agree on the provincial council election draft law
517821 the parliamentary kirkuk crisis cell has criticized the request of the kurdish brotherhood list at the kirkuk governorate council to integrate the governorate into kurdistan region it considered the decision a violation of the law and constitution a statement issued by the crisis cell said that the announcement about the integration of kirkuk into kurdistan lacks constitutional legitimacy saying that the aim behind this announcement is to send a threat to the iraqi council of representatives which will discuss the provincial council election draft law in an extraordinary session on sunday
517822 a new political entity called martyr mijbil al shaykh isa movement was declared in kirkuk today in a statement distributed in kirkuk the movement said that this is the right time to prevent the separation of kirkuk from iraq and handing it over to those who planned the collapse of iraq the movement said that it coordinates with the national kurdish parties and the representatives of the arabs turkomans and assyrians to prevent the separation of kirkuk from iraq
517823 the iraqi government calls on all parties in kirkuk to be abided by calm and wisdom to rely on law and constitution
517824 the iraqi government stresses its rejection to any individual step to change the situation in kirkuk and considers it illegal and unconstitutional
517825 kirkuks final situation is controlled by constitutional mechanisms and political consensus that was agreed upon by all parties and the government has started to follow through the committee of article 140 of the iraqi constitution that clarified the roadmap of kirkuks future on bases that have been agreed upon to guarantee peaceful living and to respect the diversity in the city
517826 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
517827 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day

517837 western women are cheap and offensive offensive we muslims are here here to stay and have a right to take advantage of the situation it is our view of the matter that we should prevail western goods like the land in which we now live belongs to allah and to the best of men his believers
517838 having families seeing naked pictures does not bring the community together
517839 in time this so called democracy will crumble and there will be nothing
517840 israels violations of the principles and bases of international law
517841 as an american jew to feel compelled to portray the ongoing and intensifying abuse of the palestinian people by israel through a reliance on such an inflammatory metaphor as holocaust
517842 that ours is a political culture that doesnt handle stress very well
517843 it america has set some dreadful precedents in past dealing with groups and ideas that were viewed as hostile to the beliefs and interests of the american mainstream
517844 is that a group of evangelical geo politicians have seized control of the government sensing their historical opportunity to shape the future of the world and that this reactionary cabal is supported and reinforced by the religious right in america that is also now for the first time exerting a direct influence on our political destiny challenging the secular heritage of the country
517845 every student shall attend worship in the college hall morning and evening at the hours appointed and shall behave with gravity and reverence during the whole service

517848 we are not required to inform parents in advance of teaching units that include same gender parents or required to release students when such topics are discussed
517849 homosexual relationships are not acceptable as they are not in many other religions but the main issue is that they didnt bother to consult with the parents homosexuality is not a priority to parents but educational achievement is this just makes parents think
517850 and at least there you have got the option of withdrawing the children
517851 there is no contradiction between the peaceful religion of islam and american values and principles
517852 one of the chief conduits through which the radical saudi form of islam passes into the united states
517853 more than 80 percent of the mosques in the united states
517854 while military action against those extremists who do others harm is a necessary part of that resolve it is not sufficient another important part of the solution is clearly demonstrating and making known in no uncertain terms that there is no contradiction between the peaceful religion of islam and americas values and principles you my friends are the shining example for the rest of the world
517855 in invoking god to be with american soldiers in our approaching war with iraq
517856 what the president did not say is that he is calling on god to kill innocent iraqi children
517857 that all italians are part of the mafia all irish are part of the ira
517858 we revere jesus as a great prophet and the messiah of god
517859 he is mentioned in the quran 33 times we equally revere the virgin mary as the mother of the messiah
517860 if i had announced that i was going to make a film about the fascist character of the bible would there have been a crisis meeting of hollands security forces
517861 would i have received as many death threats as i have done since announcing i was making a film about the koran
517862 the iranian parliament will request to reconsider our relationship with it the netherlands
517863 in iran insulting islam is a very sensitive matter and if the movie is broadcast it will arouse a wave of popular hatred that will be directed towards any government that insults islam
517864 the government is taking the announcement of this movie quite seriously obviously because the movie hasnt been made we cannot say anything about the movie until the movie has been shown but the message mr wilders has told us he wants to portray is disturbing
517865 i believe our culture is much better than the retarded islamic cultures
517866 ninety nine percent of the intolerance in the world comes back to the islamic religion and the koran
517867 the comic book will showcase spider man lending a helping hand to the united nations
517868 will get excited if they know their heroes like spider man will work with the united nations to address these issues peace and security
517869 sensitize youth as they claim they would have started with hamas homicidal brats and king whiney not with tom and huck then maybe just maybe
517870 will undoubtedly contribute to helping young people gain a better understanding of our world
517871 the living martyrs are awakening and kafirs world seem to be shaking let us make jihad move to the front line to chop chop head off kafir swine
517872 its not as messy or as hard as some may think its all about the flow of the wrist sharpen the knife to its maximum and before you begin to cut the flesh tilt the fools head to its left
517873 about now you should feel the knife vibrate you can feel the warm heat being given off but this is due to the friction being caused
517874 kafirs your time will come soon and no one will save you from your doom
517875 the comic book will showcase spider man lending a helping hand to the united nations

517878 will undoubtedly contribute to helping young people gain a better understanding of our world
517879 it is customary to put mohammed in front of the name
517880 those who insult the prophet of islam should be punished with bullets
517881 i think you have made the classic mistake of stereotyping an entire group of people because of the extreme acts of a few
517882 its obvious that this is such an extreme act that no muslim there are seven million muslims in this country and not a single one condones that or thinks it in any way represents islam
517883 you should and every all 1 2 billion muslims should rise up tomorrow and say you dont kill a human being over a teddy bear right am i right
517884 but youre not a world leader youre a good guy
517885 have no more right or business putting wahhabism on trial for the september 11 attacks than we do to putting christianity on trial for the oklahoma city bombing
517886 what part of the country has the highest murder rate
517887 the south what part of the country has the highest rape rate the south what part of the country has the highest church attendance the south
517888 when you put your jesus glasses on you cant see the truth
517889 the mockery of religion was a main focus in the classroom
517890 i felt like he her son wasnt learning what he should be curriculum wise so i pulled him out
517891 corbett has been a powerful reminder to me that we christians do not have the monopoly on truth corbett is training young students to think critically
517892 there were feelings that she is going in the wrong direction going with some other boy or some other thing
517893 we cannot let culture supercede religion if we stay away from the teaching of islam we pay for it
517894 allah permits you to shut them up in separate rooms and to beat them but not severely
517895 the morning after the murder of ashraft the prophet declared kill any jew who falls under your power
517896 among those muhammad ordered killed was abdallah bin khatal the messenger ordered him to be slain because while he was a muslim muhammad had sent him to collect the zakat tax with an ansar and a slave of his his girls used to sing a satire about muhammad so the prophet ordered that they should be killed along with abdallah he was killed by said and abu barzah the two shared in his blood one of the singing girls was killed quickly but the other fled so umar caused his horse to trample the one who fled killing her
517897 it is not fitting for any prophet to have prisoners until he has made a great slaughter in the land
517898 whenever they hypocrites are found they shall be seized and slain without mercy a fierce slaughter murder a horrible murdering
517899 that dress is two sizes too big for you it would fit a moo cow
517900 which one of you prom queens needs a walk home from school today
517901 no you are not going to wear my good petticoat opie
517902 you will forget yourself step on the hem and trip and fall and get it dirty
517903 i dont know whose idea this gender bender day was
517904 but i know the next time theres a school board meeting im going to be there
517905 a boy and girl play dress up and tell stories about how the assiniboine a native american tribe encourages their children to wear the clothes that suit them best and play the games they most enjoy without the limit of stereotypical gender roles
517906 it would be better to use a local recording studio
517907 kenapa kami harus memberi penjaminan bagi basuki yang berhak memberi jaminan dan meminta penangguhan itu ya keluarganya atau pengacaranya
517908 silakan fraksi pdi p yang proaktif tidak etis kalau kami yang meminta
517909 tinggal nanti real politiknya bagaimana ini fenomena yang biasa saja
517910 dalam kasus ini antara persoalan politis yang mungkin melatarbelakanginya secara kebetulan bertemu dengan bukti bukti hukum yang diperlukan
517911 permohonan dan persetujuan pencairan dana melalui enam kuitansi yang ditandatangani ketiganya yang membuat basuki ali burhan dan m jasin ditetapkan sebagai tersangka
517912 tapi tidak kurang kurang contoh bagaimana daerah menanggapi otonomi itu justru dengan cara membuat sebanyak banyaknya lembaga dalam rangka meraup sebanyak mungkin dana apbd
517913 jika sebuah dinas dipimpin seorang pejabat eselon 2 lalu pegawainya 15 20 orang bayangkan berapa anggaran untuk sebuah dinas dengan personel sebanyak itu
517914 belum termasuk biaya kantor dan segala sarana kerja lain seperti kendaraan dinas biaya rutin dan lain lain di indonesia saat ini ada 410 kota dan kabupaten termasuk hasil pemekaran yang belum beroperasi sebanyak 352 di antaranya berpemerintahan
517915 tujuan otonomi untuk menyejahterakan masyarakat secara demokratis lantas kabur bahkan hilang dulu di zaman sentralisasi penyejahteraan itu dilakukan pemerintah secara tidak demokratis
517916 dengan kewenangan lokal yang lebih besar dalam era otonomi harusnya kewenangan itu berujung pada penyejahteraan yang lebih baik kepada masyarakat jika tidak dan jika apbd hanya memberi manfaat bagi anggota dewan saja untuk apa ada otonomi
517917 terjadi pembengkakan belanja dprd sebesar rp 650 juta per tahun hampir 200 persen dari angka normatifnya menurut pp no 110 2000 dan itu berarti telah mengurangi pos pembiayaan pembangunan yang mestinya bisa dinikmati masyarakat setempat
517918 aksi judicial review terhadap pp tersebut yang dilancarkan dprd provinsi sumatera barat dikabulkan oleh hakim ma
517919 karena mereka menganggap menjadi anggota dpr itu adalah pekerjaan sehingga orientasinya cari uang bukan pengabdian padahal itu adalah amanah dari rakyat harusnya ibadah pengabdian
517920 yang terjadi sekarang ini bukanlah kegagalan politikus sipil yang gagal adalah sistemnya bukan politikus sipilnya masih banyak orang sipil yang bagus tapi mereka tidak terekrut karena sistemnya salah
517921 atau sistem itu memang dibiarkan salah sehingga bisa dimanfaatkan orang orang tertentu untuk mengambil keuntungan dari situ
517922 saya percaya pada awalnya sih mereka tidak berniat untuk korupsi tetapi karena sistemnya serba tertutup mereka di dpr sendiri yang menentukan seperti apa makanya kesempatan untuk melakukan korupsi itu terbuka luas lagi lagi ini soal sistem yang tidak beres
517923 kata mereka biarkan saja mereka korupsi toh nanti juga mereka masuk neraka kita sih diam sajalah meskipun miskin yang penting kita bisa masuk surga
517924 jargon seperti itu membuat masyarakat diam saja padahal semestinya kepada mereka dijelaskan bahwa mereka itu menjadi miskin karena para pejabat dan politisinya korupsi korupsi itu bukan cuma urusan si pelaku korupsi dengan tuhan tapi urusan si pelaku dengan kita semua
517925 jadi sejak semula reformasi ini telah salah membidik musuh korupsinya itu akibatnya reformasi gagal mengatasi problem korupsi reformasi itu seperti petinju shadow boxing melawan korupsi musuhnya tidak kelihatan reformasi hanya memukuli ayang ayang ha ha ha
517926 yang keliru harus diperbaiki jangan lagi pemilu nanti kita memilih partai gambar pohon atau kerbau atau bintang atau apa
517927 kita harus memilih orang sehingga wakil rakyat nanti bukan lagi wakil partai melainkan wakil kita sesungguhnya
517928 mampukah para politisi itu menjalani laku bertapa di tengah keramaian jika malah tergoda dengan korupsi ia menjauhkan dirinya dari kesucian
517929 dalam penyelidikan kami menindaklanjuti laporan masyarakat ditemukan indikasi korupsi menggelembungkan mata anggaran apbd 2002 yang menyebabkan negara dirugikan sedikitnya rp 4 6 milyar
517930 pemberian premi asuransi bagi pemimpin dan anggota dprd adalah sesuatu yang tidak dikenal dan tidak sesuai dengan ketentuan peraturan pemerintah nomor 110 tahun 2000 tentang kedudukan keuangan dprd
517931 di samping itu perbuatan alokasi dana tersebut juga tidak sesuai dengan rasa keadilan masyarakat yang tengah dilanda krisis ekonomi
517932 enak saja bagi bagi duit di tengah penderitaan rakyat ingat kehidupan rakyat jabar lagi terpuruk
517933 kalah di tingkat pertama bukan persoalan karena masih ada kesempatan banding begitu seterusnya
517934 kami seperti diberi racun yang kemudian disebar ke mana mana kalau mau jujur dewan juga bisa mempertanyakan ke mana dana rp 500 milyar dikucurkan yang semestinya untuk perbaikan jalan selama tiga tahun anggaran
517935 karena itu saya pesimistis bahwa tuntutan legal standing dari lbh dan wjcw bisa dikabulkan hakim
517936 kenapa ibu mega tidak menjadikan pemberantasan korupsi sebagai agenda utamanya
517937 ada keterlibatan yudikatif juga walau memang hanya sedikit kasus yang masuk ke pengadilan
517938 uu otonomi daerah tidak mengatur sampai rinci seperti pp 110 2000 yang sampai menyebutkan tentang persentase gaji anggota dpr dari gaji bupati wali kota
517939 di natuna riau tuh contoh paling jelas gubernurnya sampai sekarang tidak mau memberi izin
517940 masalahnya pemilihan presiden langsung pun direkayasa partai partai besar agar presiden berasal dari mereka juga
517941 dalam sistem korupsi yang sistematis perlu ada pemimpin untuk memutus mata rantai korupsi tidak bisa dari bawah
517942 anggaran biaya operasional itu bisa dipakai untuk apa saja mau dipakai bayar rumah atau apa terserah sesuai dengan kebutuhan masing masing anggota dewan
517943 kalau mau jujur praktik kkn paling besar terjadi di eksekutif sebagai pelaksana proyek bernilai besar
517944 kalau hukum ini mau adil sikat dulu penguras dana blbi yang telah meruntuhkan perekonomian negara dan menyengsarakan rakyat
517945 penentuan anggaran ini hampir di seluruh daerah melanggar pp ini setelah mahkamah agung mengabulkan judicial review tidak ada lagi rambu rambu untuk kontrol publik terhadap sepak terjang para wakil rakyat di legislatif
517946 kita tunggu setelah dibukukan oleh biro keuangan pemerintah provinsi saja
517947 tahun lalu bendahara dprd membayarkan angsuran biaya pembangunan rumah pribadi anggota dprd secara langsung ke pengembang uang angsuran itu ya diambil dari biaya operasional juga tapi saya tidak tahu berapa besar angsurannya
517948 skeptisisme masyarakat ini sebenarnya beralasan karena pp no 110 2000 banyak dilanggar oleh sebagian besar kabupaten kota dan provinsi di indonesia serta tidak ada sanksi
517949 padahal wakil ketua dprd surabaya ada tiga orang dan terlibat dalam korupsi itu
517950 dua tersangka lain adalah ketua dprd sumbar arwan kasri dari pan dan wakil ketua dprd ny tity nazif lubuk dari partai golkar

517957 at the moment cars receive information on their radios and gps but we want cars to also transmit information both to the road infrastructure and to other cars around them
517958 we are aiming to improve traffic flow more efficient traffic management to send cars on different routes to ensure the traffic keeps moving
517959 this is another very worrying data foul up by the government the last thing long suffering motorists need at the moment is the thought that they might be the victims of car crime fraud
517960 this is a huge problem and it will go on and on until the documents run out
517961 we are dealing with criminal fraternities operating on a national basis and stealing good cars to order
517962 we were as careful as we could have been but when we tried to get the tax disc updated and discovered our car had been stolen in february
517963 i have not been able to verify that the certificate was from a batch that had been stolen because i have not had sight of it whilst the agency is sympathetic the dvla cannot be held responsible for the dishonest acts of third parties
517964 the dvla or their associates gave the crooks the tools to do this job they say they have publicised the issue but no one we have spoken to was aware of this problem
517965 it is extremely disappointing to see so little activity and assistance from the dvla when stolen vehicles are being sold with dvla paperwork

517975 the share of income taxes paid by lower income taxpayers will be lower than it would have been without the tax relief while the share of income taxes for higher income taxpayers will be higher
517976 the rapid pace of technological change has been a major driver in the decades long widening of the income gap in the united states
517977 the nation faces some very tough choices in coming years
517978 that such a large share of the income gains are going to the very top at a minimum raises serious questions about continuing to provide tax cuts averaging over 150 000 a year to people making more than a million dollars a year while saying we do not have enough money

518050 theres a slight chance i might be going to hell
518051 after checking my sources information that was put out in my email was wrong
518052 im just re posting it and other people can decide if its true
518053 weve got some bikes in here that havent seen the light of day since that time
518054 with the price of gas being what it is people are going in the back of their garages and finding their bikes
518055 were supposed to get some new bikes shortly but manufacturers are having a hard time keeping up with the demand for parts for bikes from years ago ive seen it here on a pretty day you can make it to most places in the city in 15 minutes so people are deciding to park their cars
518056 at 4 a gallon it doesnt take long until you notice when you are or arent using gas
518057 i guess im what you call a pretty avid biker i regularly take a 35 mile ride but even if i wasnt now is the time to ride unfortunately new bern isnt as friendly to bicyclists as wed like it to be
518058 all you have to do is ride around town a few times to see the worn paths
518059 they arent designated bike paths but thats what people are using them for there are a good number of people in this city who bike and when you see those worn paths you cant pretend they arent there
518060 the health benefits are good and the recreational benefits are good
518061 but there are also people who live in new bern who ride a bike because they have no other choice
518062 jacksonville is getting in the game greenville is to say that new bern wants to go green by buying hybrid vehicles is really pretty chintzy if you want to really go green do something to encourage more bikes
518063 id just like to ride my bike around town without fear of a coronary or worse on streets like trent road it is a very convenient thoroughfare for me or would be if it werent such a hair raising experience
518064 i have finally begun to use my bike for routine things like trips to harris teeter now that they have a cart corral that i can use as a bike rack
518065 but it does involve crossing glenburnie road which is ok as long as i shop at 5 a m
518066 all the people who are screaming about bicyclists being dangerous ought to be at the front of the line to ask for money for some of these projects
518067 i guarantee you if some of them were funded everybody not just cyclists would be happier
518068 i only know one story but oftentimes small pieces seem to be stories themselves
518069 you have to be a bit of a liar to tell a story the right way too much truth confuses the facts

518085 you dont know what youre doing so youre dragging out any challenges you can
518086 you really dont know me or have control over my information
518087 once a transaction is in queue much less after the fact we are unable to adjust it in any way
518088 i understand that you have millions of transactions per day and that it would be an unwise policy to meddle with transactions as a matter of habit however ive been done seriously wrong here ive had an abysmal experience with your company and im afraid that im going to make any future business with you contingent of this being made right
518089 im sorry it is impossible if there were a button to push i would gladly do it for you you see for security purposes we do not enable our representatives any ability to adjust accounts if they had such an ability they could change who got paid for transactions what you could do is contact the seller of the item you bought request a refund and then execute the transaction again
518090 i would not want to inconvenience the seller and go through a whole separate process i appreciate your thinking about security however banks and credit cards face the same issues and their representatives many offshore as staysmalls was not have the ability to correct mistakes could you refer me to a customer care executive
518091 actually any email that you send us is referred to that department for their review so if you send us feedback it will be reviewed
518092 i apologize but since i tried to correspond with you earlier and received no response i do not have much faith in the email route i will find the appropriate executive thank you for your help i realize that none of this is your fault
518093 its my job to know this is my jurisdiction there are only a couple of guys on the list in this area

518111 i do not have to give the reasons behind my decision
518112 the law has to be applied to all equally but some always find a window of escape
518113 the sure thing is that president christofias does not give out the message of the just and fair society that he was promising before the presidential elections
518114 without knowing all the details i am against granting any form of clemency because no one is above the law
518115 as a matter of principle all people are equal before the law
518116 if it is judged that someone should be granted clemency the reasons behind this form of pardon should be known so it does not upset the citizens because they have a right to know
518117 i am sure that if the president granted his pardon it is for important reasons
518118 i will not judge president christofias decision for pardoning the young lawyer but i would like to point out that some people in society such as lawyers mps and doctors have to be an example of upholding the law and of proper social behaviour
518119 i do not personally know the circumstances under which the pardon was granted or the reasons as to why it was suggested but if it was granted under no significant grounds it is unjustifiable and no one can be above the law everyone should be equal before the law and since no explanations were given each citizen has the right to believe that because of her profession as lawyer that makes her more equal to the law
518120 if you cant do the time dont do the crime
518121 we shall not flag nor fail we shall go on to the end we shall fight in france and on the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on beaches landing grounds in fields in streets and on the hills we shall never surrender and even if which i do not for the moment believe this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving then our empire beyond the seas armed and guarded by the british fleet will carry on the struggle until in gods good time the new world with all its power and might sets forth to the liberation and rescue of the old

518224 the recognition of the bahai community in egypt would be regarded as a departure from islam and the teachings of divine religions and that no one can be allowed to recognize it as a religion
518225 the bahai faith has no relation to divine religions but that it is a newly invented religion that appeared in the late 19th century under the protection and blessings of english occupation with the aim of disintegrating muslim unity and denying islamic principles
518226 the bahai faith is a new religion entirely independent with beliefs principles and laws of its own which differ from and are utterly in conflict with the beliefs principles and laws of islam no bahai therefore can be regarded a muslim or vice versa even as no buddhist brahmin or christian can be regarded as muslim or vice versa

518242 many athletes come in to the olympics trying to break records
518243 what you want to do is win the gold medal and not look at breaking a record that to me is very critical
518244 i have seen athletes who make comments that they want to break the record and theyre concentrating so hard on that they walk away with nothing
518245 it was my time you have to understand athletes train so hard and thats why politics has to be so far away from the games
518246 when you train for so many years to perform on this big stage where the entire world is watching you may never get that chance again so you have to take advantage of what is in front of you

518260 we had great trouble choosing between the last two poems phuoc tan dieps portrait of death as an artist is a powerful evocation of the aftermath of war through the metaphor of death as a painter we are invited to reflect on how even long afterwards the melancholy aesthetics of death persist through still and spare language the pathos and loss of war are wonderfully evoked
518261 i want to wake people up there are more important questions than whats on tv tonight we threw it out and now talk about life and death about love and sacrifice about war and freedom then we seek some answers to the questions that arise before life ends
518262 groenten zijn in mijn ogen het meest essenti le bestanddeel van een gerecht ze vormen de basis voor gezonde voeding
518263 ik had met mijn echtgenote afgesproken om slechts voor een bepaalde periode een restaurant uit te baten
518264 mijn passie voor groenten is ontstaan tijdens mijn eerste reis naar thailand in 1987 ik verbleef daar in naam van mijn toenmalige werkgever het restaurant la villa lorraine brussels restaurant van chef kok freddy vandecasserie red we gingen toen de wereld rond om onze belgische keuken te promoten in die functie maakte ik kennis met de thaise keuken ik kwam in contact met een heel andere eetcultuur de manier waarop men in thailand met groenten omging was voor mij een hele openbaring ik was namelijk opgeleid volgens de klassieke franse keuken die van nature zwaar is in thailand heb ik groenten leren waarderen en de plaats geven die ze verdienen
518265 we zijn inderdaad opgegroeid in een periode waarin groenten als garnituur werden beschouwd in kwaliteitsrestaurants was het de traditie om een aantal garnituren aan het basisingredi nt toe te voegen enkele klassiekers zijn de groene boontjes omringd door spek een opgevulde tomaat enz ik had het idee dat we niet creatief genoeg waren met groenten ik ben vanaf dat moment groenten als het meest essenti le bestanddeel van een gerecht gaan beschouwen voor mij zijn groenten meer dan alleen maar garnituur
518266 neen in thailand heb ik groenten leren waarderen later is dat ge volueerd naar een omgekeerde benadering eerst denk ik na hoe ik mijn groenten zal klaarmaken om daarna te kijken welk stukje vlees of vis daarbij hoort het voordeel van een omgekeerde benadering is dat mensen gemakkelijker hun dagelijkse portie groenten verorberen het is algemeen geweten dat mensen veel te weinig groenten eten nochtans zijn de voordelen van groenten algemeen bekend gezondheid creativiteit kleur enz
518267 neen ik ben er in geslaagd om mijn ultieme droom te verwezenlijken namelijk een eigen restaurant uitbaten ik had bovendien met mijn vrouw afgesproken om slechts voor een bepaalde periode een restaurant uit te baten het is fysiek een heel zware arbeid
518268 ik heb persoonlijk nooit hoog opgelopen met restaurantgidsen maar ik heb er wel mee leren leven het is enerzijds een commercieel verhaal omdat het aantal sterren een invloed heeft op de omzet van een restaurant anderzijds is het belangrijk dat men een eigen cli nteel opbouwt want gidseters komen nooit terug naar hetzelfde restaurant voor bepaalde restaurantgidsen hebben we hoog gescoord voor andere dan weer niet je moet een gids dus nemen voor wat het is
518269 de politiek is momenteel ons vak aan het kapot maken onder meer door het heffen van taksen het wordt steeds moeilijker om een restaurant rendabel te houden in alle partijprogrammas staat dat de horeca een probleem heeft en dat de politiek de sector uit het slop moet halen partij x legt daarbij de nadruk op de btw partij y op de aftrekbaarheid van de belastingen enz we kunnen alleen maar vaststellen dat na 160 dagen onderhandelen de regeringsonderhandelaars nog met geen woord hebben gerept over de horeca je mag dus gerust stellen dat de politieke wereld niets voor ons doet
518270 de vraag kwam van lokaal gezondheidsoverleg regio leuven logo regio leuven werkt in opdracht van de vlaamse overheid aan gezondheidsbevordering en ziektepreventie red om op zoek te gaan naar een manier om kinderen meer groenten te laten eten ik ben dan op bezoek gegaan bij een aantal scholen en kwam tot de vaststelling dat meer groenten op school mogelijk was maar enkel op langere termijn enerzijds hebben scholen een overeenkomst met cateraars waarin het aanbod van groenten voor een bepaalde periode is vastgelegd scholen kunnen deze overeenkomst niet onmiddellijk stopzetten anderzijds blijft slechts een derde van de kinderen op school eten we wilden echter iedereen bereiken de ideale oplossing bleek uiteindelijk de smaakbom te zijn
518271 momenteel is het aanbod beperkt maar we worden overstelpt met aanvragen een belangrijk nadeel van de smaakbom is de beperkte houdbaarheidstermijn van het product het product bevat namelijk geen bewaarmiddelen op die manier is het bijvoorbeeld heel moeilijk om de smaakbom via de supermarkt te verdelen
518272 ik besef dat we niet alle kinderen kunnen overtuigen van het belang van het eten van groenten het is voor mij dan ook voldoende als ik er in slaag om een aantal kinderen te overtuigen om meer groenten te eten op die manier bouwen ze vanaf hun jeugd een gezond voedingspatroon op bovendien merk ik een positieve gedragsverandering t o v groenten bij jongeren van zeventien achttien jaar het zijn diegenen die zijn opgegroeid met fastfood en andere ongezonde eetgewoonten er is dus echt wel een verschil merkbaar
518273 denkt na ik heb twee maanden gewerkt aan mijn boek feesten is gezond 2 het lijkt me logisch dat ik zoiets niet gratis doe bovendien is een boek een interessant communicatiekanaal om mijn filosofie te verspreiden ten tweede zijn er altijd kookboeken geschreven daarnaast zijn boeken een middel om mijn creaties vast te leggen voor de toekomst niets tastbaar meer over ten slotte is het zo dat ik mezelf via boeken verplicht om creatief bezig te zijn
518274 ik ga recepten cre ren op basis van stoffen kleur gevoel enz op die manier kan ik bijvoorbeeld een saus bereiden die fluwelig smaakt wanneer er parels in een kledingstuk zijn verwerkt kun je bepaalde accenten leggen op die manier cre er ik een aantal gerechten

518293 just say yes say yes go out and find melanie and help her trust me on this son it is something i need you to do

518306 organizational learning development and planned change cannot be understood without considering culture as the primary source of resistance to change
518307 this ability to perceive the limitations of ones own culture and to develop the culture adaptively is the essence and ultimate challenge of leadership
518308 the bottom line for leaders is that if they do not become conscious of the cultures in which they are embedded those cultures will manage them cultural understanding is desirable for all of us but it is essential to leaders if they are to lead
518309 a pattern of shared basic assumptions that the group learned as it solved its problems of external adaptation and internal integration that has worked well enough to be considered valid and therefore to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive think and feel in relation to those problems
518310 every group must know what its heroic and sinful behaviors are and must achieve consensus on what is a reward and what is a punishment
518311 building an effective organisation is ultimately a matter of meshing the different subcultures by encouraging the evolution of common goals common language and common procedures for solving problems
518312 we basically do not know what the world of tomorrow will really be like except that it will be different that means that organizations and their leaders will have to become perpetual learners
518313 the most powerful signal to which subordinates respond is what catches the leaders attention consistently particularly what arouses them emotionally but many of the things to which leaders respond emotionally reflect not so much their conscious intentions as their unconscious conflicts
518314 in a way its lucky that people accept their sufferings as their karma as the will of god otherwise they would be up in arms and there would be killings and bloodshed

518339 tony eh bella domanda d tra di noi non ci siamo ancora consultati quindi non posso dirti com stato effettivamente per la band nel suo insieme a me piaciuto e mi sono divertito dal mio punto di vista andato bene gianfranco s confermo
518340 gianfranco s a me piacciono molto i dream theater li ho ascoltati e li ascolto tuttora molto e volente o nolente la musica che hai ascoltato influisce nel tuo modo di suonare qualcosa di naturale anche se non voglio imitare lo stile dei dream theater e delle bands progressive che ho ascoltato questo modo di approcciarsi alla musica riemerge nei mie suoni in quanto ho immagazzinato informazioni che poi anche se non ne sono del tutto consapevole riemergono da un lato positivo e ne sono contento tony a me piace molto il grunge ed il post grunge in generale apprezzo tantissimo i creed quindi lo stile di tremonti nei pezzi pi duri mi influenza maggiormente oltre a tremonti apprezzo molto anche altri chitarristi come ad esempio steve vai e jason becker sono persone che sperimentano molto nella musica non sono statici come altri chitarristi che quando li ascolto mi sembra di sentire lo stesso suono dallinizio alla fine
518341 gianfranco no no io non ho un ruolo di maggior rilievo rispetto agli altri i pezzi vengono abbozzati da tony poi noi ci troviamo ed ognuno indipendentemente dagli altri ci lavora su proponendo poi al gruppo ci che ha pensato cos poi cerchiamo di mettere insieme le parti che abbiamo sviluppato in questalbum in fase di registrazione abbiamo registrato prima le linee di tastiera ma per il resto io non penso di avere un ruolo predominante sugli altri tony noi siamo nati come un gruppo composto da cinque teste ed ognuno cerca di metterci del suo ha ragione gianfranco a lui poi diamo i compiti pi prettamente burocratici amministrativi ma a livello musicale penso che siamo tutti e cinque alla pari
518342 gianfranco non ho mai fatto caso a questa cosa forse perch ne sono dentro e non ho mai ascoltato il nostro album pensando a quanto dici comunque quando componiamo ognuno a casa propria lavora sulla bozza scritta da tony e quindi impossibile che seguano mie linee o altro
518343 tony s vero ora ti spiego sono oltre 10 anni che siamo insieme e in tutto questo periodo abbiamo scritto molti pezzi
518344 gianfranco pensa che quella stata la nostra prima canzone in assoluto non volevamo neanche inserirla poi invece labbiamo ripescata e abbiamo deciso di metterla come prima canzone dellalbum proprio come introduzione
518345 gianfranco grazie dei complimenti guarda io penso che i nostri testi riflettano molto ci che sentiamo e proviamo e anche il nostro modo di rapportarci a dio ti spiego io non prego tutte le sere lo faccio quando lo sento credo che allinterno di un rapporto non si debbano fare le cose per forza se io sono troppo stanco so che se prendessi in mano la bibbia avrei la testa altrove e la leggerei in malo modo quindi non la apro neanche non penso che questo sia uno smacco nei confronti del signore ma anzi credo che sia un rapporto vero quando non ho voglia di leggere o parlargli non devo sentirmi obbligato a farlo gli dico sinceramente che sono stanco e che preferirei dialogare con lui un altro giorno e dirgli questo penso faccia parte del rapporto stesso penso che io stia parlando sinceramente a dio e che lui capisca se non c questo tipo di rapporto secondo me non una relazione del tutto fondata sullamore e sulla sincerit ma finisce con lessere qualcosa di dovuto di conseguenza quando le persone si trovano davanti ad una difficolt grave della vita come ad esempio un lutto penso che se costoro hanno sviluppato un rapporto sincero con dio possano fare fronte a queste disgrazie continuando il loro rapporto con il signore al contrario se non hanno sviluppato un rapporto del genere penso che in quei momenti possano andare in crisi e magari rinnegare dio stesso nei nostri testi penso che emerga questo rapporto tony s sono molto belle le conversioni in musica di persone che erano atee e hanno riscoperto dio ma pensiamo anche a coloro che da cristiani hanno rinnegato la loro fede come successo ad alcune bands quali i kings x o a roger martinez ora sinceramente non so se costoro di cui ho fatto lesempio abbiano ritrovato la retta via lo spero per loro ma di sicuro hanno avuto momenti di grande sbandamento

518354 we certainly dont want the high winds associated with a hurricane but we sure could use some of that rain

518357 whats with all the getting dressed up to go to a football game
518358 many great intelligent talented academy winning actors standing by awaiting a major press conference to show their support
518359 the ad is a bit ironic given that mccain has been the most pop culture savvy republican candidate in quite some time
518360 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
518361 johns been a celebrity ever since he was shot down
518362 obama has almost transcended that and has become famous as a famous person which is why they are comparing him to paris hilton
518363 for the time being obama maintains the edge and has the strength of a majority of electoral votes his triumphant foreign trip allows him to continue to define this race but too many of these states are close and a sizable number are undecided or choosing a third party candidate so there is a lot of fluidity
518364 we should be able to deliver bottle hot water to dehydrated babies
518365 said that a terrorist attack in the united states would be a political benefit to the presumptive republican presidential nominee
518366 within an hour after the july 7 blast the afghan president had blamed a section of the pakistani establishment for the incident i would ask him to share the proof and we would look into it
518367 terrorism remains the single biggest threat to our stability we cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred fanaticism and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric
518368 our army is out on the roads we are assisting the civil police to maintain peace in the region
518369 koi sune tab na dilli mein someone has to first listen in delhi
518370 i have spoken to the dgp state police chief and curfew has been imposed
518371 the situation is not just bad it is dangerous jammus anger at the raw deal it has got for the last six decades is showing but i am more worried about the danger of communal tension
518372 i have become a symbol of america returning to our best traditions
518373 you will say to yourself i have to vote for barack
518374 not going to university did give me an incredible driving force because it leaves you with a slight chip on your shoulder it makes me feel i am going to read absolutely everything so i can prove that i am not stupid
518375 i cant quite handle the idea of screen actress in big west end hit and all that i would prefer to do something smaller
518376 everything scares me the idea of doing theatre scares me in an exciting way but doing any part always terrifies me it boils down to a fear of standing there in a wig and a dress and suddenly thinking i feel like an idiot you must not let your imagination see the absurdity of it and cause your performance to die
518377 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of shaheed martyr benazir bhutto
518378 increasing outdoor activity may be a way to counter factors that might be contributing to myopia
518379 but we still cant say whether its the effect of genes or whether the parents create an environment that promotes myopia
518380 what has held out over the years is that children with strong scholastic achievements tend to have myopia our new study shows that children who do a lot of schoolwork and spend time outdoors appear protected
518381 we want the customer and farmers to benefit from this venture
518382 he was in possession of a passport issued by the pakistan government for his travel to bangladesh after coming to bangladesh he stealthily came to assam stayed back and even contested the election this can happen only in assam
518383 he had married a girl from lanka in 1990 he filed nominations to contest the 1996 elections but later withdrew he was arrested and deported in 1998 and 2000 this is his third arrest
518384 deepak comes from a humble background and has risen due to sheer hard work winning the contest is not important now but the fact that he made it to the final is enough
518385 remember back in 07 when we knocked off michigan yeah that was a very good year
518386 a wild man has clambered down out of the swiss alps and made his way across the italian border he is without language something formless wandering over the structures of civilization a living breathing phantom the various conversations musics and babblings he hears stick to him as metal shavings to a magnet he hops a cargo ship to mexico and hides out in broad bright daylight he forms alliances follows trade routes makes observances late nights as he nods off there is the mental jibberjaw taking place between the measured and the unknown this record was made to fall asleep to

518394 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
518395 in that building existed little more than a bunch of companies which hire
518396 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
518397 there was no significant loss of life in those towers their own evil is

518401 too many software suites aim to provide ever feature they can a holdover from the days when naive purchasers made decisions about which lms or word processor to buy by checking off boxes on a features list over stuffed software is like a swiss army knife they do a lot of things but do none of them as well as a dedicated tool its handy to have a phillips screwdriver and a corkscrew in your pocket you never know when youll be in need however if ive got to dr ive a dozen phillips head screws or uncork several bottles of wine ill use a screwdriver or a real corkscrew most of the time single purpose tools and software work better than toolkits on a knife or bloatware
518402 much of our programming is interspersed with other programming owned by other people
518403 we completely understand the audiences interest in getting the full programming were trying to balance that desire with the rights of the content ownership
518404 what should be the next steps in exploring the development of personal learning environments firstly there are some prototype ple like applications already in being piloted besides the jisv funded plex application the elgg personal learning landscape supports many of the functions of a ple and has a growing installation base in many parts of the world no doubt other such applications could be identified but perhaps more important is the increasing use of social software including blogs wikis and bookmarking applications for learning both within the education system and within enterprises and public services one thing is certain there can be no such thing as the personal learning environment it is better to envisage a family of different applications and services which support the conception of such of the ple the use of these applications can provide a fertile research environment for exploring further the development of ples such research should include approaches to learning and knowledge and technical development it might include examining in depth how individuals are using computers for learning in different settings especially non educational technology and outside the setting of formal educational programmes exploring the relationship between informal learning and formal learning in developing competence examining different forms of competence and how educational technology can support such competences examining the use of different social software applications for learning examining in depth the nature and form of computer mediated interactions between learners in different communities examining the implications of persistence of data for personal learning environments examining the different ways in which learners might wish to represent learning both formal and informal examining what materials are used for informal learning and how they are used exploring the implications of changing forms and patterns of learning for educational institutions exploring ways of representing and patterning learning activities interactions exploring ways of utilising different services both within and between institutions and with broader communities to support ple type activities exploring issues in standards and interoperability to facilitate ple type development exploring how ple type applications and services can be integrated or work alongside existing educational applications and services none of this precludes or replaces the development and piloting of new and creative learning applications which might be seen as a ple but such development needs to take place alongside pedagogic and social research and development otherwise we are in danger of once more driving down a blind alley

518419 precisamos tomar todos os cuidados com os jogadores justamente por isso ele era uma grande op o que vinha entrando no time e agora ap s um jogo n o contamos mais com o atleta por toda a temporada
518420 over the next five games if we only won two of those i dont think the confidence is going to drop away either
518421 i think for us it is all about septembe r
518422 obviously they will try to shut the run down and it will a tight in close game
518423 a bit of a drudge and a bit of a chore sometimes for players
518424 but once you can see september once you hit august i think the enthusiasm starts to pick up again
518425 every team goes through a bit of a trough at some stage and we have the last two weeks but weve got no doubt well bounce back
518426 i knew about shontayne quite some time ago so hes not really an issue
518427 steve matai until we hear exactly from the sea eagles that he is going to have off season surgery its hard to comment
518428 until i know exactly what his situation is i will deal with it then
518429 injuries are a huge part of our game and theres not a great deal i can do about it
518430 all i can say is the 24 players we end up picking for this world cup will be super committed to playing for their country
518431 thats all i can ask of them and thats what i will be asking of them
518432 with regards to sonny thats a different situation and ill let that one pan out as it does
518433 im playing a bit of a diplomat here but you have to treat each case on its individual merit
518434 im in no position to demand that a club releases their player for test football when i could be doing that player an injustice
518435 if i see a player who is playing the last eight rounds of the season though and he feels he is in a position to play at the world cup then all i can do is ask the player
518436 once we get to that stage we will deal with it then
518437 these guys know they are being watched by selectors now
518438 obviously some of these guys will have experience from previous years and from the centenary test that will keep them in good favour
518439 in saying that form is always what we look at to pick a side and this time around it will be no different
518440 we sat down as a group of selectors last saturday and we went through all the players we have been keeping an eye on
518441 forty is a big number so i guess you could say in a squad that big there are definitely some bolters
518442 when you get good athletes like williams theyre going to be good in just about any sport you shove them into and i think he could be good enough in rugby union to one day become an all black
518443 if he puts the work in and stays humble and things went his way with injury and that theres no doubt he could go as far as he wants
518444 if sonny bill plays the game hell probably be playing at 13 or on the wing just to try and get a feel of the game
518445 and to have a bloke like tana who is probably the best in that position in the last two decades you couldnt have a better bloke to try and get you on your feet and running in rugby union
518446 any team that gets him would be rubbing their hands together and really looking forward to playing with him
518447 so sonny bill should steer away from no 8 for me it would be a big no no
518448 its a position you need to grow up playing youre a key linkman at no 8 and you make probably the most crucial decisions on the field with the nine halfback and 10 five eighth
518449 hed make a good no 6 thats a better position to learn the game but if it were over to me id put him in the centres thats his position i reckon
518450 it being a publique fast as being the first wednesday of the month for the plague
518451 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
518452 omg hes totally playing the race card did you see that omg 1 11
518453 we couldnt catch the ball and we didnt block anybody but we made up for it by not tackling anyone
518454 im interested in anybody thats a good player thats my job
518455 i dont want to start the controversy but were going to look into it and certainly do our work on glenn eric parker just got released
518456 youve got to have as many people as you can working on the field weve had a couple offensive linemen in to work out we might bring in a couple receivers who knows who were going to bring in but well fill that roster spot as soon as possible

518461 we pretty much own that so we didnt want to lose it
518462 the father hits the easy button and the kids are ready for back to school
518463 has every thing you need its easy and it is the most wonderful time of the year
518464 the first ad showing a barbecue and a parent bringing the child joys of summer to an end with a push of the
518465 the original most wonderful time of the year ad was a brilliant piece of laugh out loud television constructed as great advertising always is on an authentic insight about the people whose money you want
518466 there was an inference that you could get your school supplies at staples but there was no sense of how this brand and therefore this retail experience was going to add any value
518467 a lot of people dont realize that we do have a mattress program and we wanted to address the misconception that we only have european sizes which we havent had for 15 years
518468 i am a big advocate of buzz marketing or word of mouth marketing tactics employed to get consumers talking including guerrilla marketing when brand communications come from another consumer as opposed to brand advertising the message is more credible and often more relevant
518469 what i especially like about this campaign though is the multi media multi tactic approach the guerrilla marketing mattresses on the street exploit wasnt a one off it was integrated with similar messages across other media
518470 i think that to appreciate what ikea has done here you have to first appreciate the size of the challenge theyve given themselves
518471 mattresses are mostly a commodity product save for perhaps one market dominant retail brand that positions itself as specialized
518472 whatever ikea may stand for in the fevered minds of its agency or in the sanctity of its boardroom to the consumer it
518473 the guerrilla marketing day was a smart move where so often these things are just meant to gratify the marketer because this initiative was in some sense off brand for ikea they had to demand attention
518474 the danger in trying to take a brand into new positioning territory is that you could lose the brand in the process the ikea guy is plainly meant to be continuity designed to recall and connect with whatever good feelings you might have about the brand
518475 real madrid believe he is important for the future and they trust qpr to take him for one year or two years to assist in his development and of course it will be good for qpr and good for the championship
518476 for me it is very important to deal with people you trust i had lunch with parejo and ramon calderon two months ago in madrid and we reached an agreement parejo is excited and we hope to finalise the deal on monday it will be fantastic for qpr and for the championship it will make things even more interesting
518477 if there was a football match with the best players in the world taking place in my back garden i probably wouldnt even open the door to have a look
518478 i played on the right wing i played a lot and i played very badly
518479 in order to uphold the honour of italian football i have not played very much since
518480 if you have a small restaurant you try and make sure all the tables are busy before you move to the next restaurant
518481 our vision for qpr is not to be a middle of the road premier league club
518482 we want to be competitive and we want to strive to be a champions league club but thats an aspiration for a long way down the road the way to be successful is to set achievable targets which give us enough time to get there because our commitment to the club is long term we have no pressure to be promoted immediately we want it of course but lets spend time and effort to build this thing the right way
518483 chelsea have done a great job under roman abramovich but everybody has their own style
518484 when i was in charge at benetton we made t shirts and went from this to winning the world championship when nobody gave us a chance against ferrari and mclaren the big teams here i talk all the time to the manager of the team iain dowie he is an integral part of the structure we have in place like the engineer and the driver working together in f1 so i speak to the players before we bring them to the club because personality is fundamental and i want everything to be correct i want them to stay here forever so we must be compatible their goals must be my goals and the managers goals this is not about ego for me or bernie or lakshmi we did not buy the club to be famous we are famous already look i have seen so many coaches make poor a lot of rich people turning big fortunes into small fortunes very quickly so we want to manage the club our way
518485 you have to work on the underbelly of the club and bringing in young lads like di carmine will be great for our future
518486 we want to be an aggressive enthusiastic side playing high tempo football and passing the ball the lads have embraced the work ethic thats the desire we want here sometimes i speak to flavio two or three times a day so communication is not a problem trying to hear him over the roar of engines is the hard part
518487 we want to grow the business over a three to five year period we are executing against that plan and we are still doing that despite all the stuff thats happened to us
518488 i think they had an opportunity to get something done in the palm of their hand and they bungled it
518489 i am more determined and more excited than ever to see those changes through
518490 they dont get it they dont understand the realities of their business
518491 i do worry about the resolve that we have to confront and defeat terrorism
518492 every time there is somebody arrested and facing charges theres some sort of controversy about oh the poor thing he must be innocent this is all being cooked up for some particular reason
518493 the cancellation of dr haneefs visa following so closely on the granting of bail is a cynical exercise and constitutes an assault on the rule of law
518494 the squeals of outrage from howard and ruddock are wonderful to behold stephen keim has had the audacity to tell the public the truth how dare he
518495 the big read reckons that the average adult has only read 6 of the top 100 books theyve printed

518501 the most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it
518502 we should hire three or four colored ministers preferably with social service backgrounds and with engaging personalities the most successful educational approach to the negro is through a religious appeal we dont want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members
518503 eugenic sterilization is an urgent need we must prevent multiplication of this bad stock
518504 eugenics is the most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial political and social problems
518505 birth control itself often denounced as a violation of natural law is nothing more or less than the facilitation of the process of weeding out the unfit of preventing the birth of defectives or of those who will become defectives
518506 as an advocate of birth control i wish to point out that the unbalance between the birth rate of the unfit and the fit admittedly the greatest present menace to civilization can never be rectified by the inauguration of a cradle competition between these two classes in this matter the example of the inferior classes the fertility of the feeble minded the mentally defective the poverty stricken classes should not be held up for emulation on the contrary the most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over fertility of the mentally and physically defective
518507 the campaign for birth control is not merely of eugenic value but is practically identical with the final aims of eugenics
518508 our failure to segregate morons who are increasing and multiplying demonstrates our foolhardy and extravagant sentimentalism philanthropists encourage the healthier and more normal sections of the world to shoulder the burden of unthinking and indiscriminate fecundity of others which brings with it as i think the reader must agree a dead weight of human waste instead of decreasing and aiming to eliminate the stocks that are most detrimental to the future of the race and the world it tends to render them to a menacing degree dominant we are paying for and even submitting to the dictates of an ever increasing unceasingly spawning class of human beings who never should have been born at all
518509 the undeniably feeble minded should indeed not only be discouraged but prevented from propagating their kind
518510 the third group of society are those irresponsible and reckless ones having little regard for the consequences of their acts or whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers many of this group are diseased feeble minded and are of the pauper element dependent upon the normal and fit members of society for their support there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped
518511 the marriage bed is the most degenerative influence in the social order
518512 our objective is unlimited sexual gratification without the burden of unwanted children
518513 give dysgenic groups people with bad genes in our population their choice of segregation or compulsory sterilization
518514 as we celebrate the 100th birthday of margaret sanger our outrageous and our courageous leader we will probably find a number of areas in which we may find more about margaret sanger than we thought we wanted to know
518515 no woman shall have the legal right to bear a child without a permit for parenthood
518516 there are other areas such as liturgical music and catechetical texts which have also contributed to the lessening of the notion of holiness in church life
518517 the rule of prayer determines the rule of faith the parish priest facilitates some degree of renewal of the sacred but without better more defined reinforcement via the liturgy in its translations then a renaissance of the holy will not be achieved the very fact that even a minority of catholics still request the tridentine mass and that the holy see has decreed that it should be offered to them should speak something to those who maintain that the status quo is without need of reform in a secular high tech and materialistic age modern man is in acute starvation for a supernatural religion which is neither manichaean nor pantheist the roman catholic faith is best suited to offer homo novus a christo centric synthesis of the two worlds of body and soul by means of the incarnation this theological hylomorphism is best explained in the churchs liturgy through cult the people express their yearning for the holy one as well as their desire to grow in personal holiness thus the second mark of the church is superbly manifested to the world any attenuation of that necessary holiness its symbolic and liturgical expression or even its linguistic reference will infect the body of christ as a malignant virus ultimately contaminating the other three marks of christs spotless bride
518518 upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it

518528 to your descendants i have given this land rom the river of egypt as far as the great river the river euphrates the lord gave israel all the land which he had sworn to give to their fathers and they possessed it and lived in it and the lord gave them rest on every side according to all that he had sworn to their fathers and no one of all their enemies stood before them the lord gave all their enemies into their hand not one of the good promises which the lord had made to the house of israel failed all came to pass
518529 blessed be the lord who has given rest to his people israel according to all that he promised not one word has failed of all his good promise which he promised through moses his servant

518531 david also defeated hadadezer king of zobah as far as hamath as he went to establish his rule to the euphrates river see gen 15 18
518532 and at that time solomon held a feast and all israel with him a great congregation from the entering in of hamath
518533 you brought your people israel out of the land of egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terror and gave them this land which you swore to their forefathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey they came in and took possession of it but they did not obey your voice or walk in your law they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do therefore you have made all this calamity come upon them
518534 you also gave them kingdoms and peoples and allotted them to them as a boundary they took possession of the land of sihon the king of heshbon and the land of og the king of bashan you made their sons numerous as the stars of heaven and you brought them into the land which you had told their fathers to enter and possess so their sons entered and possessed the land and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land the canaanites and you gave them into their hand with their kings and the peoples of the land to do with them as they desired they captured fortified cities and a fertile land they took possession of houses full of every good thing hewn cisterns vineyards olive groves fruit trees in abundance so they ate were filled and grew fat and reveled in your great goodness but they became disobedient and rebelled against you and cast your law behind their backs and killed your prophets who had admonished them so that they might return to you and they committed great blasphemies

518536 now o lord god your promise to my father david is fulfilled for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth

518544 technically brotography is a play on my last name brotebeck and choreography
518545 however the term has become an expression that my dancers have used to describe the style of my choreography
518546 and while i choreograph mostly for musical theatre whats most important is that each piece tells a story
518547 but when it comes to actual steps i would say my choreography is very rhythmic and in tune with the music that i am working with i also love to have my dancers traveling all over the stage i like to really use the space

518671 if there is it will be a very very different anglican communion from the one we have experienced so far
518672 i do think this critical moment has just added to the sad reality or the sad understanding of the reality that we are not going to be able to put humpty dumpty together again
518673 it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
518674 theyve a temper some of them particularly verbs theyre the proudest adjectives you can do anything with but not verbs however i can manage the whole lot impenetrability thats what i say
518675 but how shall that work not to think of anything
518676 when you are trapped by poverty you are not free when trade laws prevent you from selling the food you grew you are not free
518677 when you are a monk in burma this very week barred from entering a temple because of your gospel of peace well then none of us are truly free
518678 your america is where neil armstrong takes a walk on the moon
518679 your america gave europe the marshall plan your america gave the world the peace corps
518680 america is not just a country its an idea isnt it its a great and powerful idea
518681 the idea that all men are created equal that we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
518682 we cant fix all the worlds problems but the ones we can we must
518683 by combining data and the one campaign we will create an organization that is stronger than the sum of its parts and better positioned to put the issues related to global poverty and voter support for those issues front and center onto the agendas of the wealthiest nations
518684 one and data are two organizations with the same outrage extreme stupid poverty in the 21st century makes no sense when the resources and technology exist to do something about it what makes sense is to harness these two forces into a single organisation and redouble our efforts one goal one team
518685 tom freston one of americas greatest ceos and david lane a seasoned leader in international policy and politics will be joining an already world class team jamie has worked tirelessly for years to build data from the ground up and the truth is we wouldnt be here without his intellect and passion in her year leading one susan mccue has turned the campaign into a force to be reckoned with now that the us election is around the corner susan is much sought after so its great news that one will continue to benefit from her counsel
518686 what a great opportunity for a case study for my readers

518690 made time to go the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
518691 at least someone stood up for us and the jury stood up for us
518692 we will take part in any negotiations and talk about any issue which consolidates our nuclear rights
518693 iran will not give an inch on its nuclear rights
518694 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
518695 syria strongly stands by iran and will not change its stance
518696 we have told the europeans that syria believes that any country including iran and based on international treaties has the right to enrich uranium and have a nuclear power plant
518697 the zionist regime has lost its raison detre is no longer able to direct us and european policies in the region and is therefore naturally heading for annihilation
518698 some countries are wrong to try to create divisions between iran and syria which will always remain by each others side
518699 the us should start pulling out of iraq and any us administration which gets to power has to do it
518700 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
518701 fired mortar rounds at the hamas police as well as a rocket at gaza city
518702 these are lies we never fired rockets or mortar rounds hamas is the one committing crimes we have asked all the palestinian factions islamists and nationalists to use their influence so that these crimes cease
518703 laid siege to our house firing mortar rounds targeting our women and our children
518704 hamass attacks undermine my call for national dialogue between palestinian factions
518705 i think its great to get as high as that
518706 at the beginning of the year a lot of people were asking me if my new setup after splitting with coach brad gilbert was going to work and questioning if it was the right thing for me to do
518707 i think my results showed that it took a little bit of time but that its paying off and im enjoying myself much more on court
518708 im much calmer and obviously my results have got better and better as the years gone on
518709 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it

518712 i hit some great lobs and passing shots which is why i managed to break him so many times four
518713 has some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan to move us in the direction of genuine energy independence
518714 if we have a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like i would consider it because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
518715 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them the bills drafters credit that the way they crafted the drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
518716 that i think is the kind of bold step that we need the fact that they are willing to put in seven billion dollars to help the auto industry retool so that those new energy efficient cars are made in america
518717 what i dont want to do is to be the enemy of the good here
518718 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
518719 if congress does not act they will owe families across america an explanation for why theyre ignoring their concerns
518720 senator obama says he wants energy independence but he doesnt support anything that serves that goal
518721 he is opposed to new domestic drilling opposed to nuclear power and wants to add taxes to coal producers he has said the high cost of gasoline doesnt bother him only that it rose too quickly
518722 i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
518723 ive had some meaningful innings in my life but with the whole situation and for the people back home its bigger than just us this victory id have to say its my best innings
518724 weve all just witnessed a very very special innings the way graeme smith came out and played was as good as ive seen anyone chase down that sort of target under that sort of pressure
518725 i knew we just needed one or two partnership i was focusing on ten runs at a time thinking lets just get close
518726 i felt we were just one wicket away if we could have got the likes of morne morkel and paul harris in on that kind of deck i felt we could have won the game
518727 theyve played better cricket than us over the three games
518728 has some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan to move us in the direction of genuine energy independence
518729 if we have a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like i would consider it because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy

518737 i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
518738 in spite of the national policy vacuum really even active resistance from washington a green economy is starting to emerge around the country this new green economy is driven by local actors often with partnerships between government business and non profits
518739 this is another instance of the grassroots flowing around the gatekeepers but since companies are making money the design of an eventual ecosystem is appearing

518887 its all boiling down to he really doesnt want to hurt those former teammates
518888 its just of a matter of what he wants more is playing more important or keeping those guys out of the friction that would come if he reports
518889 mark murphy had talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
518890 and frankly its good for brett because brett needs to stay part of football and obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
518891 i dont think it makes any sense for us to speculate
518892 we talked a lot about this and well just leave it at that
518893 badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
518894 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
518895 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
518896 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
518897 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
518898 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
518899 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
518900 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
518901 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical
518902 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
518903 for someone whos been in washington nearly 30 years hes got a pretty slim record on education and when he has taken a stand its been the wrong one
518904 im happy to put my record and ideas up against his any day
518905 i dont come out of central casting he said listing his youth name birth in hawaii and childhood in indonesia as things voters might not be used to
518906 what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from what my values are
518907 so what i think has been an approach of the mccain campaign is to say hes risky
518908 they are very good at negative campaigns they are not so good at governing
518909 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama who has opposed every element of john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling affordable nuclear energy and gas tax relief for hardworking families
518910 there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bipartisan group i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions
518911 but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect
518912 it became cold and dark and suddenly it was light again i am very happy it was worth the trip
518913 therefore there are roughly 225 000 more people living with h i v in the u s than previously suspected
518914 the previous estimate was 1 million to 1 1 million
518915 we are not effectively reaching men who have sex with men and african americans to lower their risk
518916 u s efforts to prevent h i v have failed dismally
518917 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
518918 lifting the ban would create new opportunities for american workers and businessmen
518919 but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote
518920 the president knows that the impact of any new drilling will be insignificant promising savings of only pennies per gallon many years down the road
518921 ivins is listed as a co inventor on two patents for a genetically engineered anthrax vaccine federal records show separately ivins also is listed as a co inventor on an application to patent an additive for various biodefense vaccines
518922 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
518923 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
518924 i must have a trillion different passwords for a trillion different web sites
518925 people will absolutely shut off the spending spigots given the soured jobs market
518926 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
518927 we cannot afford four more years of the failed bush economic policies and that is what sen mccain if offering
518928 americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face
518929 mourns the loss of dr bruce ivins who served the institute for more than 35 years as a civilian microbiologist
518930 what smith did was wrong and we take very serious and he is being punished severely for it
518931 he knows what those are and we will move forward
518932 ken got overwhelmed with every single player coming up to him and telling him hello
518933 i think it was great that he came out today a lesser person would not have come out but he did and we cant wait to get him back
518934 i know hes extremely remorseful and he understands but if we want to be a good football team we have to win without him
518935 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
518936 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everybody elses business or their personal lives its inappropriate lohan told the photographers as she made her way through los angeles international airport
518937 ronson 30 said in an update on her facebook page that bratton should talk less and do more
518938 nenhum fdp vai cumprir essa porra toda no maximo duas
518939 a cidade de alexandria louisiana decidiu proibir o uso de cal as de cintura baixa comum entre os adolescentes a exemplo de outras cidades do sul dos eua que j adotaram ou debatem uma medida parecida

518982 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
518983 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
518984 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
518985 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
518986 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
518987 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
518988 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
518989 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
518990 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
518991 we face serious issues in this election and have real differences
518992 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars i will however compare our two visions for our economic future
518993 de ninguna manera pienso que la campa a de john mccain es racista pienso que es c nica
518994 su equipo es muy bueno a la hora de crear distracciones y de concentrarse en ataques negativos
518995 requerimos que los diferentes medios de comunicaci n tengan el acceso m s amplio posible para informar sobre los juegos ol mpicos y yo soy firme al decir que no ha habido ning n acuerdo en absoluto para que aceptemos restricciones nuestros requisitos son los mismos de ciudad a ciudad organizadora y seguir n inalterados en vista de que el coi entr firm un contrato de ciudad organizadora con beijing en el 2001
518996 no voy a ofrecer una disculpa por algo de lo que el coi no es responsable
518997 nosotros no estamos a cargo de la internet en china las autoridades chinas est n a cargo de la internet
518998 los medios de comunicaci n extranjeros podr informar libremente y difundir su trabajo libremente en china no habr ninguna censura en la internet

519014 ive seen the final result of the vote for the u s the web site vote ended on sunday july 27 and we always sit together the day of the show in the afternoon because we need to let the lighting designer know you have to program the desk for the order of the songs so the crew needs to be informed exactly but we are much more flexible and we have a different situation in the first three shows because we are playing with sammy hagar as a package and that means in california because of the strict curfews and the situation there are three bands i think we dont play as long as we normally do in europe we play like two hours and twenty and here its just like 90 minutes so that automatically changes the set because we have to leave quite a few songs out so we will talk about the setlist when we all meet before the first show in a few days
519015 yes yes theres not one song that we dont know some of them like 89 those songs are not so popular and with us theyre not so popular either laughs and therefore we havent played those and if we dont have to play them we wont but everything in the top 50 we know right away also we keep changing the set around you can imagine the votes the results in russia are totally different from the ones in the u s or in spain they vote for different songs than in england or japan
519016 a few but not too many it has to be the right proportion people dont like it if you play too many new songs but we play three or maybe four they americans want to hear the back catalogue the

519024 the challenge by groups like isna and mpac is not merely their efforts to silence steven emerson their challenge is really to any american who dares to speak the truth about jihad islamism and islamic supremacism groups such as isna and mpac may or may not silence any one individual but we must make it clear to islamic supremacists everywhere that they will never silence all of us who will defy the ideology of supremacism that is inimical to our freedoms our values of equality and liberty and our nation

519089 he started the second innings really well obviously massively up for the game and then played a pretty good looking shot and was caught inches off the ground by the guy at extra cover
519090 sometimes the game can be like that youve got to ride that through youve got to back yourself keep your belief weve got to support him and hes got to move on
519091 the way he came out and played and chased down that target was as good an innings as i have ever seen under that sort of pressure

519095 the vikings said they got guys who were better than me behind me
519096 well i led the team in interceptions two straight years there and darren sharper was there with me
519097 so you tell me if they had better players behind me
519098 it probably always does have to do with off the field stuff
519099 i know dwight smith and what kind of person he is
519100 hes a rock jawed tough guy great ball skills instinctive he knows how i want the game to be played and how i want it practiced hes a great addition to our team
519101 you really dont compare coaches because you know theyre all going to have different styles
519102 rod marinelli and i won a super bowl together so naturally our comfort level is better
519103 but ill say the one difference is were early in camp and we havent tackled to the ground yet in minnesota we would have had five six days of full contact to the ground by now why were professionals you shouldnt beat yourself up in camp like that
519104 i would do each and every thing that i did again
519105 i would push resolution 125 which raised the tax for the first time in argentina since the advent of democracy we have seriously discussed a law that for the first time addressed redistribution of revenue
519106 my expectations at that time were enormous i knew i had played well enough to win at oakland hills i didnt feel like i had done anything to lose there were a couple of bounces that didnt go my way
519107 i was excited to play in the british open my confidence was as high as at any time in my career nineteen ninety six that was a good year
519108 and i feel it extended beyond that through 1998 maybe 1999 there werent many better
519109 i always admired the way nick faldo hit his irons how precise he was with his game but definitely there were a half dozen years there when i hit it close a lot
519110 i was trying to win the u s open i was going to rip a drive down there hit an 8 iron close make a birdie and be the u s open champion
519111 i couldnt have hit it better the drive was well in the fairway but it kicked into the bunker bad bounce
519112 more wind than ive ever played in for a full four days
519113 overall i was happy with the way i played short game needs work but im hitting it pretty well im looking forward to oakland hills great course great greens
519114 ive played some excellent rounds and a 65 on the course ben hogan called the monster certainly ranks up there
519115 my plan for next year is to play 15 or 16 of the regular events that i enjoy the most and add five or six champions tour events
519116 and then in 2010 my plan is to move full time to the champions tour

519119 as a number three batsmen i have got to score runs and in this series what have i got
519120 i have had some good balls and a little bit of bad luck
519121 but i set myself a lot of high standards and in this series i have not got anywhere near those standards so i want to look at that and make sure i get back to playing like i can
519122 you have to deliver out in the middle i am an experienced player and at the minute i am not delivering so i will have to come up with a formula to give myself the best chance to deliver when the pressure is on
519123 let the dust settle because emotions always run high after defeats like this
519124 its the first time i have ever lost back to back games and i am more gutted than anyone because midway through the day i expected us to bowl them out for 200 and win quite comfortably
519125 definitely i think the cricketing gods can sometimes make it hard work
519126 he started the second innings really well obviously massively up for the game and then played a pretty good looking shot and was caught inches off the ground by the guy at extra cover
519127 sometimes the game can be like that youve got to ride that through youve got to back yourself keep your belief weve got to support him and hes got to move on
519128 the way he came out and played and chased down that target was as good an innings as i have ever seen under that sort of pressure
519129 we threw everything at them we had that flurry of wickets in the afternoon and we just felt we were going to get wickets consistently and blow them away
519130 we are thrilled to expand the festival from a 5 day to a 10 day format this growth is a function of not only the strong support and interest we have received from the entire tampa bay community but also due to our capabilities as a full time organization

519137 you want to be able to drink enough that youre urinating a normal amount that youre urine is clear that youre able to sweat quite a bit you really probably cant drink too much in those situations if youre spending a lot of time outside drinking lots of water its probably a good idea

519184 one of the greatest films about sicily ferdinando remains one of the great icons of my movie going memory has some of the richest most beautiful black and white photography ever put on film and sensual atmosphere where lust and passion become almost aromatic very inventive it really moves as few films do with deftness and the driest most cutting wit its a film that truly haunts me as funny as it is the emotions that germi was dealing with were primal savage and most disturbingly of all eternal
519185 maliciously funny in a crowded cartoonish style that suggests the work of preston sturges

519226 parang hindi naging friendly yung camera nakailang takes kami nahiya nga ako at sorry ako nang sorry sobrang nako conscious ako kasi first time ko talaga e si chard marami nang experiences sa ganun kasi matagal na siyang gumagawa ng movies tapos maraming nanonood sa set at may foreigners pa but after the take nagpalakpakan silang lahat ang ganda rin kasi ng view overlooking kami on top of santorini and you can see everything including the sea mga suot namin bu magay rin sa view after this may isa pa kaming kukunang kissing scene na mas meaningful
519227 sabi nga ni direk joyce bernal si richard marespeto talaga pero ang natutunan ko as an actress dapat hindi ka mahiya kasi youre just portraying a different character on screen dapat yung character ang isipin mong ginagawa mo but as it is im thankful to star cinema kasi first movie ko sa greece pa kinunan and its with someone na hindi ko ine expect na makakasama ko with abs
519228 takaw tulog siya sobra pero mabait siya sa lahat nung una ilang pa sa kanya ang mga kasama naming taga abs kasi nga from gma siya but after a while they realized na madali siyang pakisamahan sa shooting kasi konti lang kami so he helped carry the equipment sa set hindi siya suplado at all bungisngis nga siya nagpapatawa bigla sobrang adventurous din siya typical na lalaking excited lagi sa greece nag rent siya ng all terrain vehicle at speedboat para masakyan namin kaya masaya lagi
519229 its something special kasi when i was in college in paris my classmates would always go to greece pero ayokong sumama sabi ko one day i will have a special reason to go there they brought me a lava pendant and i really love that souvenir from greece so when i got there yun ang una kong hinanap and i introduced it to chard i got one for him and he got one for me may meaning daw ang figures ng greek symbols na nakalagay roon

519543 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them the bills drafters credit that the way they crafted the drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
519544 that i think is the kind of bold step that we need the fact that they are willing to put in seven billion dollars to help the auto industry retool so that those new energy efficient cars are made in america
519545 what i dont want to do is to be the enemy of the good here
519546 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
519547 if congress does not act they will owe families across america an explanation for why theyre ignoring their concerns
519548 senator obama says he wants energy independence but he doesnt support anything that serves that goal
519549 he is opposed to new domestic drilling opposed to nuclear power and wants to add taxes to coal producers he has said the high cost of gasoline doesnt bother him only that it rose too quickly
519550 i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
519551 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama who has opposed every element of john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling affordable nuclear energy and gas tax relief for hardworking families
519552 if i were to try to read much less answer all the attacks made on me this shop might as well be closed for any other business i do the very best i know how the very best i can and i mean to keep doing so until the end if the end brings me out all right whats said against me wont amount to anything if the end brings me out wrong ten angels swearing i was right would make no difference

519568 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
519569 we have told the european countries that every country including iran has the right to engage in uranium enrichment and to possess nuclear power stations based on agreements
519570 what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day
519571 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
519572 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
519573 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
519574 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
519575 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
519576 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
519577 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
519578 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
519579 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
519580 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
519581 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
519582 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
519583 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
519584 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese
519585 we care less about human rights than other countries and more about sovereignty thats bound to create an awkward feeling among other countries

519604 i dont look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
519605 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
519606 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
519607 almost none of you maybe none of you thought that i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
519608 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
519609 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i am african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
519610 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
519611 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid

519660 as we come to rely on computers to mediate our understanding of the world it is our own intelligence that flattens into artificial intelligence
519661 in their arguments with christopher hitchens and richard dawkins the faithful have been defending the existence of god that was the easy debate the real challenge is going to come from people who feel the existence of the sacred but who think that particular religions are just cultural artifacts built on top of universal human traits its going to come from scientists whose beliefs overlap a bit with buddhism

519704 it bounces different ways it happened and luckily we bounced back
519705 theyve got the record they do 62 46 overall for a reason theyre a solid ballclub they hit they play pretty good defense you let that team stick around and theyll get a three run homer or a two run double to beat you
519706 two homer games arent easy to come by so you enjoy them when you get them
519707 ive just been patient it takes a little time to get used to playing pro ball hopefully im getting the consistency down
519708 theres nothing more exciting than being in a pennant race with a few weeks left in the season
519709 every game and every pitch is meaningful but we just want to go play every day because things are so packed and tight in the standings and it can all change in one day if we just do what we can well be fine
519710 we are facing the best pitching team in the league and we expected to see good pitching in these three games
519711 we played good defense and they played good defense and pitched well but they scored more runs than us tonight
519712 its impossible to tell whether the films ending is happy because its happy or because its ending
519713 u s sen barack obama said today he would be willing to open floridas
519714 its easy now to pretend that the surge and its success was inevitable
519715 declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work
519716 the cantarell oilfield in the shallow waters of the campeche bay is regarded in the mexican oil industry as the countrys crown jewel it is the worlds second largest oil field by production pumping about 2 2 million barrels of oil as much as every oil field in kuwait put together for that reason the news from petroleos mexicanos the state oil company that the fields production would begin to decline this year was met with dismay declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work

519724 n o mas uma corrida l parece que leva anos para terminar
519725 im just going to give em hell and see what happens
519726 that sounds great and all but track is an individual sport its you against the tape measure
519727 but ive got some goals of my own to accomplish
519728 im not going to watch them im not going to spectate
519729 in high school it was more of a forced thing to do
519730 you start sports in the seventh grade you have football and you have basketball and you have track typically the same coach coaches all of them
519731 there is a big tree about 60 feet out in the sector
519732 i hit it one time and they didnt know what to do so they gave me another throw
519733 it would probably have been my best of my high school career thats how things are run down in the middle of missouri
519734 maybe if i put a little more effort into it a little more time maybe this could go somewhere
519735 it was my first indoor meet at mu my junior year i threw a huge pr personal record
519736 when i didnt make it i was in pretty bad shape
519737 in my head i was going to make the team no matter what
519738 i always thought there would be this big ahhhhh moment
519739 there are sponsorships they dont pay you to sit on the sidelines
519740 but i wouldnt be going to the olympics if i didnt think i could win a medal
519741 im stronger than some of the other top throwers but they are more consistent in their technique
519742 you are trying to keep something under control that is basically uncontrollable
519743 he was about 6 foot 6 had a strong arm and had the leverage of a roman catapult
519744 he was skinny kid back then and had to rely on technique but like a lot of americans as he has gotten so much bigger and stronger his technique isnt as good as it should be
519745 someone trying to hit the ball too hard wont hit it as far as someone who hits it the right way
519746 in the javelin you cant make that big throw if youre trying too hard you have to rely on your technique not your arm
519747 teaching with him and seeing him develop was one of the things that i am most proud of
519748 we havent won a gold medal in the mens javelin in over 50 years and havent won any medal in it in more than 30 and i would love to change that
519749 right now i just want to have fun and stay relaxed
519750 if you get too serious youre liable to mess up i know ive been training all year so theres nothing to be worried about
519751 if im an olympic gold medalist i can be the superstar i want to be
519752 or if im sitting around thinking my opponent is doing more than me let me do a couple abs
519753 he was a little too eager to make that team
519754 he knew he was good he knew he was one of the top in the country but he never thought that he could make a mistake and that little mistake when he hit the last hurdle cost him a spot
519755 now he knows that last hurdle is the key so he knows how to attack that last hurdle a little better he knows how to not run too fast and run into it or run too slow and cant make it over it
519756 its not always about the fastest guy is going to win today
519757 because there are so many technical problems you can have around the track which is why they are called hurdles so whoever works those problems out the most efficiently is going to win
519758 im not really excited about going my main objective is to be on the podium and bring home a medal
519759 im going to take every opportunity as it comes this might be my last time making it so im going to go for it
519760 its impossible to have the kind of workouts she had without dropping a bomb somewhere and i mean drop a bomb in a good way
519761 she can run like no person ive ever coached male or female
519762 theres just no way for her not to run well if shes healthy
519763 i wasnt training or anything and i still got seventh that says a lot to me
519764 i know i should medal and if i dont ill be disappointed in myself its within reach in both events
519765 really i dont think the 100 final at the olympics is going to be as strong as the final was at trials
519766 i dont feel pressure because i feel like i should be here just like anybody else who made it just going to compete for the u s thats a big deal so im more proud than i am nervous
519767 everybody likes to win but not everybody hates to lose as much as michael
519768 im more relaxed going into the olympics than i was in 2004
519769 first his physical strength is greater as a result of a more intense training program thats given him another element of power and speed to go with his endurance thats quite a combination
519770 and his breast has gone from a stroke that was quite weak to a strength
519771 if they gave black belts for handling pressure michael would be a sixth degree black belt
519772 hes very matter of fact he focuses race by race day by day and then moves on
519773 he has an uncanny knack for knowing what hes capable of
519774 hes extremely kinesthetically aware of everything happening with his body ill say your left hand needs to do this and he will do it precisely
519775 he had a temper i remember thinking he had the potential to be really good so i felt a responsibility to set him up for the best chance to do well
519776 they almost always involve me pushing him past a limit he doesnt want to go to
519777 hed be there doing his laps and see our scenes
519778 in 2003 mary ann limbert a 31 year old canadian came into our practice group the first day michael and i had one of our things she said i was so glad to find out michael is not a robot
519779 when hes good hes so good you pinch yourself when hes bad he is really bad
519780 we know what irritates the other so we can easily do it but not so much anymore
519781 he really does listen even when he acts like hes not
519782 his relationship with his dad is not hostile but not much of one
519783 but his dad was regularly in the picture and came to meets through high school they havent seen each other much since michael moved to ann arbor
519784 i never tried to fill the father role i wasnt his best friend or parent but those lines get blurred and you have to maintain boundaries as a coach and athlete
519785 i remember one morning during rush hour i got stuck on a hill and stalled i still cant drive stick
519786 i let him out of practice 15 minutes early so he could get dressed
519787 first he came out and asked me to tie his tie then he came out with his shirt buttoned one off the whole way so i had to re button it
519788 horses dont talk back at least not verbally and you know where they are and what theyre eating
519789 horses are so fragile you cant train them the way you train swimmers
519790 no thats a lot of pressure to put on a horse
519791 the one who bites me on the ankle thats the one ill name after michael
519792 theres an art to coaching as well as a science
519793 the more you use your imagination the farther youll go
519794 if you think about accomplishing the unthinkable youll have a good chance of doing it
519795 the british love chants it reminds them of football games
519796 are healthier and break down in the body more easily
519797 comes from an upper class instanbul family who after two failed relationships goes on an obsessive journey in search of places and objects that remind him of his lost loves and that once assembled constitute the bulk of a museum of his obsessions
519798 omg thats my daughter too im not the only one who deals with this stuff

519807 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
519808 the people of the united states and iowa are wise they understand whats at stake in this election
519809 voting for obama is the political equivalent of bungee jumping
519810 we do not want the next president to have a fundamental misunderstanding of the world we live in
519811 every time i comment it sets off more stories and talk that i think is distracting to the campaign
519812 im honored to have my name mentioned in that discussion but i dont talk about it anymore
519813 as big a booster of ethanol as anyone in the country
519814 i think a lot of people are waiting to see who he picks
519815 i think if he picks a more moderate person to run with him he could be in trouble
519816 there is still work to do the win those voters over but i think were doing a good job

519820 globalization may be losing some of the inexorable economic power it had for much of the past quarter century even as it faces fresh challenges as a political ideology
519821 the industries most likely to be affected by the sharp rise in transportation costs are those producing heavy or bulky goods that are particularly expensive to ship relative to their sale price steel is an example china s steel exports to the united states are now tumbling by more than 20 percent on a year over year basis their worst performance in a decade while american steel production has been rising after years of decline motors and machinery of all types car parts industrial presses refrigerators television sets and other home appliances could also be affected

519825 we talked about the oil boom weddings everything under the sun
519826 but nobody ever mentioned that missile i guess that shows that people arent worried about it im certainly not
519827 it has to be 100 percent stable for movement its not a quick process we have to make sure everything is stable first
519828 if there is a problem they will take care of it
519829 theyre moving them things around all the time so were used to it

519883 as sal entertains her grandparents with phoebes outrageous story her own story begins to unfold the story of a thirteen year old girl whose only wish is to be reunited with her missing mother
519884 zei een oudere sportverslaggever tegen me sport is niet iets om te doen maar iets om naar te kijken en weg was ie met zn veel te dikke buik ik was net begonnen als journalist en voetbalde zelf nog ik hield alles bij wist ook alles maar helaas nu voldoe ik toch aan het beeld van die collega van toen zonder die dikke buik dat wel
519885 was ik een redelijke verdedigende voetballer droomde van een grote carri re maar kwam nooit verder dan het eerste elftal van een zondag derdeklasser tijdens mn studie in kampen mocht ik nog wel meetrainen met de selectie van dos kampen toen landskampioen bij de amateurs maar de geneugten des levens stonden die grote carri re in de weg en waarschijnlijk een gebrek aan genoeg talent badminton basketbal en judo heb ik ook nog geprobeerd
519886 maar dan als journalist liefhebber hoewel ik niet meer alles weet en bij hou ook mijn harde schijf raakt een keer vol volg ik veel vooral natuurlijk de grote evenementen deze zomer is het smullen ek wimbledon olympische spelen topsport is prachtig vooral als het ergens om gaat wel is mn interesse meer naar de achtergronden van de sport verschoven holland sport op tv is in dat opzicht ontzettend goed jan bos in de studio achter een groot blok ijs waarop die moet uitleggen over wat voor richeltje hij is gestruikeld en wat dat met m doet prachtig
519887 ik word intussen beperkt door een onwillige knie een overblijfsel van het voetballen hele slechte sport voor knie n en enkels anderhalf jaar geleden liep ik ineens met een ballon op mn knie vocht veroorzaakt door een slijtageplekje een beetje tennissen gaat nog hoewel ik daarna een paar dagen met een pijnlijke knie loop maar voetballen is er helaas niet meer bij scheelt wel een hoop dromen
519888 dat is mijn hele leven al zo van 1996 2001 was ik correspondent in isra l en speelde ik op het veld toen ik terugkwam in nederland dacht ik nu moet ik daar maar eens mee stoppen ik ging squashen maar na drie maanden was ik dat zat en heb ik mijn oude zaalvoetbalteam opgebeld van v r 1996
519889 ik kon meteen weer meedoen en dit jaar ben ik via een zaal collega gevraagd om bij hem bij f c breukelen ook op het veld te komen spelen daar ga ik komend seizoen mee door ik speel in de spits in het veld en ook in de zaal als meest vooruitgeschoven speler daar kan ik erg van genieten bij voetbal het diepgaan en de bal aangespeeld krijgen om zelf te ervaren maar ook om naar te kijken
519890 verder kijk ik bijna nooit televisie dus zeker geen andere sporten ik houd het voetbal wel bij en normaal gesproken ook alle belangrijke europese competities maar dat haal ik allemaal uit de krant ik ga niet dag in dag uit voetbal zitten kijken ik heb daar misschien wel zin in maar het kost veel te veel tijd
519891 vroeger ja vroeger was alles beter had je voetbal op zondag en soms op woensdagavond ivm europese wedstrijden tegenwoordig is het mogelijk bijna elke dag een wedstrijd te zien met als gevolg dat ik bijna nooit meer kijk ek is uitzondering maar ook nl competitie champions league etc kijk ik niet tenzij ajax belangrijke wedstrijden speelt maar ja helaas spelen ze die bijna niet meer
519892 toen joop zoetemelk de tour won heb ik een racefiets gekocht omdat iedere nederlander toen dacht dat ie kon fietsen maar nee fietsen kon ik niet
519893 is volgens het rooster van mijn sportschool het klasje bodypump weer voorbij het klasje waar ik om 10 30 uur frisgedoucht had willen staan zweten en zo gaat het bijna iedere week ik en sport het komt niet echt van de grond
519894 dat is niets nieuws om onduidelijke redenen ik heb hier niet al te bewuste herinneringen aan zat ik een blauwe maandag op ritmische gymnastiek toen ik 5 was denk ik
519895 had ik gymles van meneer stekelenburg een neef volgens mij van die beroemde nos sport familie honkbal was zijn ding mijn ding die laatste twee uren op de woensdagmiddag vrij krijgen want die motorische gestoordheid was door het ritmisch gymen echt niet voorbij gegaan en elke keer als laatste gekozen worden om in het trefbalteam te komen gaat ook vervelen
519896 na tennis en heel lang niets ben en ik 30 nu dus aanbeland bij bodypump dat is met gewichten trainen op muziek in groepsverband een sportvorm die over de hele wereld gegeven wordt toen ik twee maanden in duitsland werkte kon ik daar zo inspringen in het na zelfstandig trekken aan apparaten en me afvragen waarom spinning docenten altijd zo moeten bl ren vreemd genoeg het enige dat ik eigenlijk al twee jaar zo ongeveer n keer per week doe de lessen worden 8x per week gegeven en lukt het dus op deze maandagochtend niet dan probeer ik het vanavond van ritmisch gymnastiek naar bodypump sja als ik het zo achter elkaar zet niet heel hero sch
519897 ja als oranje speelt of de turken een waanzinnige laatste 15 minuten spelen begint het echt te kriebelen gek genoeg ook als ik de tune van de nos radio tourflits tourflits tourflits hoor maar een echte wedstrijdvolger ben ik niet
519898 ik keek vroeger wel gefascineerd naar al die techniek motorrijders in de tour live schakelingen naar waar ook ter wereld voor het voetbal prachtig vond ik het nog steeds zon radioverslag van de uitslag van de voetbalcompetitie vorig jaar smullen passief genieten van hoogtepunten en dus zo af en toe ritmisch bodypumpen meer kan ik er niet van maken ben ik bang behalve dan de belofte uitspreken dat ik vanavond om acht uur weer in die sportschool sta echt
519899 drie keer per week ben ik aan het hardlopen en afgelopen november heb ik mijn eerste marathon gelopen
519900 sindsdien is mijn conditie achteruitgegaan vanwege de voorverkiezingen maar ik heb nog steeds een aardige tien kilometer in de benen
519901 hardlopen is ideaal omdat ik zelf kan bepalen wanneer ik loop als het me lukt om uit bed te komen dus niet na een verkiezingsnacht kun je me om 6 uur s ochtends in de washingtonse omgeving tegenkomen tijdens trainingen vind ik het heerlijk om naar podcasts te luisteren van de wall street journal aanrader npr en cnn politics
519902 in amerika zijn we natuurlijk verwend met heel veel sporten en sportuitzendingen ik vind het fascinerend om naar american football te kijken go redskins maar ook in het ijshockeystadion kun je me af en toe vinden maar eigenlijk zijn alle sportevenementen een ideale middag of avond uit amerikanen weten er altijd een mooi spektakel van te maken onlangs ben ik met mede correspondenten tom jan meeus nrc en philippe remarque volkskrant naar een honkbalwedstrijd geweest en hoewel ik de sport niet bijzonder boeiend vind was het toch een gezellige avond
519903 al was het maar omdat de wedstrijden in dolby 5 1 surround worden uitgezonden je zit echt in het stadion

519918 i walked with her for a bit and from her perspective maybe it was unwanted attention but she didnt make that clear
519919 it didnt seem like she was telling me to go away if shed told me to leave id have done so straight away
519920 that was at 12 33pm i know because just a minute before id made a call from my mobile to check how much credit i had left
519921 i know i have done wrong in the past and if i could go back in time and change that i would
519922 ive missed out on so much i should have been getting on with my life who knows what i could have done and achieved
519923 i dont want to spend any more time in any of her majestys holiday camps i wont follow women anymore i know its wrong
519924 i will be vigilant from now on i am never going to give anyone the chance to send me away again i have changed
519925 i think the lesson really is that in considering a case of this complexity the police and those responsible for the prosecution need to keep an open mind as far as possible as to who might be responsible for the crime
519926 i think they did close their mind after the arrest of barry george

519928 this is part of a systemic problem of the administration and i said im not going to take it anymore
519929 the disdain and uncooperative nature that this administration has shown toward congress is so egregious that i can no longer assume that it is simply bureaucratic incompetence or isolated mistakes rather i have come to the sad conclusion that this administration has intentionally obstructed congress rightful and constitutional duties
519930 the mystique and allure of the t206 wagner card continues to grow
519931 id love to manage again see if i could get back on the wheel again
519932 i grew up here this is where i learned how to be a winner here be a champion here
519933 its a little different a little bit of a transition
519934 im a lifer im a grinder i didnt get fired at the end of the season
519935 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
519936 this is actually the time between now and in september when we could be seeing a lot more grows that were able to harvest around the state
519937 in the mountains it gets real hard to chase anybody youre about done if you try and run up a ridge or run up a hill youre pretty tuckered out and these guys theyre in a lot better shape than we are
519938 usually they run and theres no way we can catch them in there in the brush but we came in on them from three sides today
519939 if they see something strange let us know because we not only want to get the garden but we want to get the people in it and were hoping we can keep them from growing
519940 clears the path for us to complete the design work and start construction
519941 the more one studies the harmony of music and then studies human nature how people agree and how they disagree you
519942 the music business is a cruel and shallow money trench a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs every day
519943 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
519944 there are british passport holders who live in the u k who are being found in places like kandahar
519945 while my troops have not actually found british passports on enemy dead there has been a suspicion that with the high number of taliban casualties they have needed to recruit a lot of foreign fighters and some of these are likely to be of british muslim descent
519946 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk
519947 this is something the military understands but the british public does not
519948 there are very small numbers of british citizens traveling out there being trained up and then returning to the uk
519949 dispatched terrorists to a number of locations including spain and the united kingdom
519950 i reached the conclusion that i did not want to leave my family any more for an extended period life is too short there is no point having a family if you are not going to see them
519951 would be up for a fight but we were surprised at how ferocious that fight turned out to be
519952 if we do not win against the protagonists of the september 11 attacks then those who are against us will take great succour from it
519953 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
519954 my job is to get students to vote republican and volunteer for republicans
519955 we have a policy of not formally endorsing or creating a perception that we favor one over the other
519956 you create an arsenal of students you can draw upon and then you have a candidate looking for student work
519957 usually the candidates would come to us or e mail or call me to see if we had students that could help
519958 there have definitely been a lot more students who are still in school but have actually gotten internships or jobs with campaigns for this summer
519959 students and volunteers are not really jumping on any campaign
519960 because of the economy students need jobs and campaigns cant always afford to pay volunteers
519961 youre seeing a lot more candidates having their college interns make facebook profiles and making their web sites better
519962 its a great way to get the message out and get people involved
519963 built in are a lot of social mobilization networking tools like facebook
519964 the only difference is that storm has only college republicans on it
519965 students have generally more time to give the campaigns than someone with a job and family does
519966 where other supporters can give money college students can get active and give time
519967 youll finish up work at midnight and then have to wake up for a 6 a m conference call
519968 students are a great resource to a campaign because they have a lot more energy
519969 i think columbia especially is kind of a good case study on the way that young people have been influencing the political world
519970 you have a lot of young kids here who have made a name for themselves in missouri politics theyre young and eager and dedicated to what theyre working for
519971 the campaign is going 24 hours a day seven days a week
519972 its very long days and pretty easy to get stressed but the best part is having all that hard work pay off
519973 i needed a summer job and i didnt want to flip burgers
519974 i would love to take what i learned and put it in the classroom
