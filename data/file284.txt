2840015 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2840016 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2840017 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2840018 it wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down
2840019 i dont know of any pre existing medical conditions that could have contributed to this tragic accident
2840020 im sure that all of our all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2840021 because of the serious nature of propane we do not know at this time when people will be able to return to their homes
2840022 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
2840023 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2840024 the person who we described as being unaccounted for i believe is someone who was an employee of the business where the explosion took place
2840025 so efforts continue to try to track down that person
2840026 he was going to check on my parents but the explosions were getting louder and louder so the three of us just ran and ran and ran
2840027 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie
2840028 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
2840029 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2840030 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2840031 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2840032 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2840033 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2840034 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2840035 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2840036 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2840037 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
2840038 people think im crazy cause i worry all the time
2840039 well we are closing the sushi bar in five minutes so you really do have to get your order in now
2840040 has that effect in terms of being a federal agency we are restricted by it
2840041 i tried to call you and it said your phone wasnt available
2840042 he came from a different generation and he just wouldnt understand
2840043 you ended up with quite a man didnt you kent is very nice
2840044 well i think you are both lucky youve found a nice life together and its all worked out
2840045 the exclusion of same sex couples from the designation for marriage works a real and appreciable harm upon same sex couples and their children
2840046 bad rulings will make it much more difficult for us to win marriage and will certainly make it take much longer
2840047 trato de no salir con nadie del trabajo eso facilita mucho las cosas
2840048 no le dijo que no a todos porque no me gustar a que me dijeran que no a mi solo por el hecho de ser una actriz pero para comprometerme con alguien de mi trabajo tendr a que ser una persona realmente extraordinaria
2840049 mis padres han estado casados por m s de 25 a os y han pasado por toda la felicidad y el dolor que uno pueda imaginar pero han permanecido juntos quiero un matrimonio fuerte como el de ellos
2840050 anyone who can build a car like this can come down to my graphics tent and pick out anything he wants
2840051 the two of us seem to be on a similar automotive wavelength
2840052 we believe in the principle of timeless functional and puristic design and we are guided by our ambition to create products that are lifetime companions personally i think that luxury is the privilege to be able to afford extraordinary goods and experiences as for porsche design such experience is not defined by lavishness and decoration but by reducing things to their essentials and by choosing high end materials that guarantee functionality and a long service life
2840053 for luxury goods producers mobile phones are a logical addition to their basic product portfolios of jewelry watches and other fashion accessories from the perspective of handset manufacturers a luxury mobile phone does not simply mean a new handset model it represents a meaningful strategic approach to increased brand equity
2840054 hey its been awhile im so glad you dropped a message if its alright i want to talk
2840055 he saw poland was made of wood and got stoned
2840056 wanted king of poland short hours loads of lithuanian blondes
2840057 ill let my music take me where my heart wants to go
2840058 is my cock would shrivel up like a frightened turtle upon hearing such a thing
2840059 t he present oppositions be suspended until the federal court decision in the passing off proceeding is handed down if there is no appeal from that decision the present oppositions shall be lifted from suspension and further directions given such that the opposition will continue through the evidence stages in accordance with normal practice and procedure
2840060 suspension of the opposition proceedings for an indefinite period amounted to a denial of justice
2840061 i didnt think it was going to get through the infield
2840062 quentin is convinced britney will be brilliant shes delighted she thinks it could turn her career around it is perfect tarantino material he wanted to get britney first shes playing the most important character
2840063 i finally got an opportunity to come up here and to play at this level
2840064 now i know i can play up here so im just going to go down there and continue with the same mentality i had when i got sent down out of spring training just go down there and prove to everybody why i should be here permanently
2840065 they are used to playing on good pitches in the south batsmen come here and see balls doing a bit off the seam and they think they have to go for their shots we didnt bat well either but slogging is the easy option
2840066 it was a typical durham pitch but for some reason the ball has nipped around
2840067 paul did ok but there werent many who deserve a pat on the back
2840068 i definitely think theres a lot more to come from alan
2840069 he knows that and we know that and thats what were working to do hes got a lot of desire
2840070 if he didnt have any desire id say youre wasting your time desire and hard work usually means you can turn it around ive known lots of players turn themselves around i know alan will
2840071 im not going to try and tell this crowd what to do
2840072 its a very knowledgeable crowd theyre the first to cheer if a player scores a goal and sometimes they show their feelings
2840073 theyve got every right to do that they pay their money thirty one thousand here for a friendly game delayed for two hours is tremendous theres a lot of good things
2840074 alan smith is a newcastle player and thats it he may not always be the best player on the pitch but no one will try harder
2840075 i am disappointed not to have been selected in any of the squads and it seems a little bit strange that none of the players that went to the icl last winter have been selected
2840076 im sure that the others are as disappointed as i am
2840077 i suggest that some of the explanations that the ecb have given as to why the icl is a threat to county cricket are unfounded and the restrictive practices that have been put in place are unfair
2840078 i would like a clear indication of where the ecb stand and the reasons for it not just to say this is our policy
2840079 i would like some clarification on whether the ecb have taken a policy decision not to select players for england if they have been to the icl
2840080 i would also like to know why players should not be allowed to sign contracts to play in the icl that do not affect their commitment to their counties
2840081 its something that i have considered but i would not want to do anything that would mean turning my back on county cricket which is why i am seeking some clarity of the situation from the ecb
2840082 we wanted to be leading from the front we wanted to do it in a controlled composed manner and thats what we did
2840083 the germans were with us all the way but we never felt like they were going to come through
2840084 weve got another seven days now to just keep that intensity going
2840085 i thought it would be a nice romantic thing to do but youre not very romantic are you
2840086 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2840087 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2840088 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2840089 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2840090 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2840091 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2840092 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2840093 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2840094 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2840095 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2840096 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2840097 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you
2840098 n o importa quem somos e sim o que fazemos
2840099 his struggles and cries are ignored the man with the knife shows no emotion the victim is slaughtered and his head cut off his flesh is eaten
2840100 es evidente que en la capital hay rezago y corrupci n en los cuerpos policiacos
2840101 hey chris you did i really great job loved the pictures and you had a lot of stuff to say i really like the last picture and i thought you did a really good job describing the characters
2840102 i used crash inter her just so i could talk to er
2840103 good its going good futi and i just finished our last room so i get to be done after this i think
2840104 thats cool im pissed because i didnt get my bruce lee movies last night
2840105 i cant let you drive this vehicle so i am just going to get in my car and drive that way
2840106 lol i was doing that in front of yelena the secretary and she loling too
2840107 there will be no hair pulling eye gouging or spitting and absolutely no slapping or cat fights make this a clean fight ladies okay lets get it on
2840108 oh my word were never going to have this baby were going to gain 400 lbs and then well never feel pretty again we are unbelievably pathetic this is all laineys fault
2840109 ladies please calm down things will work out we just have to hang in there a little longer what will be will be
2840110 ladies heres the deal new rules and these arent just for this impromptu meeting so listen up first rule of heather club dont talk about heather club second rule of heather club dont talk about ah screw it 1 no crying 2 no blaming others 3 no slacking on duties pull yourselves together pregs we still have a job to find bills to pay a dog to feed and a human being to give birth to
2840111 the most ungentlemanly piece of riding i have seen in a long time
2840112 there was no need for johnny to keep us in like that
2840113 i am very surpised it was as if he was looking at the horse from the start
2840114 johnny had me trapped and when it was time to go i begged him to let me go and he wouldnt let me through
2840115 i probably made a mistake by running him over a mile and a half in the irish derby as it was too far for him
2840116 i think hes a very progressive horse and i will need to discuss it with the owners but dont be surprised if you see him come back for the breeders cup turf
2840117 i think the biggest thing to address is the inequality of cycling medals between the sexes
2840118 this win shows that if you prepare properly for a one day race not racing every weekend but doing something specific it can work
2840119 we are a massively different team when rob is in
2840120 he doesnt just provide quantity stats but quality as well scott hill also had a big influence on us today things just seemed to work for us we looked in control
2840121 we just didnt turn up to play in the first half
2840122 it was the lack of effort that worried me most i sound like a broken record at times ive said this plenty of times this season about conceding that many points and expecting to win games
2840123 i wanted england to be chasing 250 but i still think weve got a really good chance
2840124 the bowlers still havent been where we know they can be but if they pick up a couple of early ones theres no reason why we cant push through
2840125 its my fifth 90 in tests but i dont really mind
2840126 getting the team out of trouble is all that matters to me missing a hundred like that means nothing to me 97 was as good as 150 so im happy to take it and give the boys a chance to pull through
2840127 the oval doesnt deteriorate too much and we could see how harris was able to hang around it wasnt spitting out of the rough or seaming all over the show so i think 190 odd is well within our grasp if we play sensibly and professionally we should stand a very good chance of getting them
2840128 at that time i was thinking how am i going to get international wickets but after 30 or so one day internationals i think ive got 40 odd so im not panicking you learn how to get international wickets and this was a start hopefully that can spur me on and im due a haul at some stage
2840129 i saw there were only one or two slips so i decided to have a go outside off and it worked in my favour
2840130 i feel basically that i let the other two down that i should have pulled my weight more and i didnt
2840131 its really frustrating and disappointing when you are that close to a medal that you are almost touching it four years is a long time to wait to try again
2840132 the weather didnt help when we had the break we got cold although we have to accept the french had the same conditions to deal with we put in so much hard work together over the last two or three years and it just didnt go to plan
2840133 to win the golf tournament is a tough ask from here
2840134 which obviously wasnt the position that i wanted to be in fortunately i still have lots to play for my aim now is just to shoot a low round a good finish is more than achievable from here
2840135 i missed a good birdie chance at the 17th then made the bogey at the last i needed to make birdies but i am delighted to be in the position i am and to have some sort of chance
2840136 three behind is ok as long as there are only a few guys between me and the lead i feel like i have left many shots out there over the three rounds but that doesnt matter if i am in the hunt with nine holes to go i caught up six shots during the last round of the open at carnoustie last year as long as there are not too many bodies ahead of you you can make up quite a big amount in the last round of a major any lead in a major is hard to hang on to you never know what can happen
2840137 i just have to keep doing what i have been doing
2840138 just keep believing and give myself a chance i feel good i feel comfortable i feel strong mentally and physically it would have been nice to par the last but i am still in a pretty decent position ill be ready for 18 more this afternoon
2840139 i have to stay patient and keep grinding away ive already made a lot of great up and downs this week to save par thats what you have to do on a course this difficult
2840140 i was a little bit worried when he was trapped but this can happen in racing
2840141 it was a long way from home and i knew that once he got out he would just stride out to the line it is great that he is now in the record books as he is a real champion
2840142 i think he will go to haydock for the sprint trophy next and then the prix de labbaye at longchamp on arc day
2840143 she was a good filly in germany last year and she ran well in two good races earlier this season
2840144 her last race didnt really count because we sent her to the front and she did too much
2840145 he had a couple of glasses of wine on saturday night when he was out for dinner
2840146 and he must have underestimated just how low their threshold is
2840147 he was mortified and staggered to find out that he was over and in another hour he would probably have been fine the same thing happened to another jockey a few years ago and he was taken off his first ride then retested and passed for a later one but the rule has changed since then and a failure means you are banned for the whole day
2840148 id be surprised if there isnt something but i havent got to the bottom of it yet
2840149 seb has always been a model professional and this has been a day to forget
2840150 we were trying to cover all options and we were hoping that exactly that would happen
2840151 we did a lead out on the hill on thursday the training day
2840152 i led them out then emma picked up the tempo sharon laws was on her wheel so we had already rehearsed that finish we knew the point at 200 metres to go where we wanted nicole to go we knew at what point the legs would be getting heavy
2840153 we wanted to make sure she laid off coming into the final corner but perhaps not that far
2840154 we were afraid someone might come down in front of her so we told her to keep to the left we knew she would chew them up after that
2840155 the plan was emma would go three kilometres from the turnstiles on the last lap
2840156 as soon as she came into the road she was to attack as hard as she could to put the germans on the defensive it worked emmas attack was fully committed
2840157 nicole could watch and wait because the other riders know what emma can do on her own so they were thinking would she ride away or was she bluffing
2840158 we felt the germans were the most dangerous and they were put on the defensive one was using up all her energy chasing and trixi worrack their best rider was flapping
2840159 i thought yes we can stay away these girls want to catch guderzo so whatever happens well be going fast
2840160 it was like a working group trying to find out the best case scenarios for getting me to the olympics
2840161 its a team effort but its not just the riders the staff and back up as well
2840162 i had tried the other route racing all season but got to major championships without full energy in the tank so why do the same thing if it had been proven not to work
2840163 but it was a high risk strategy because i was trying it for the first time i stuck to the plan and i believed in it
2840164 im not going to lift my arms up ill promise you that
2840165 does it really deserve to be here ahead of darts
2840166 he had a fantastic opportunity to protest me and probably get me disqualified so i had to take a penalty turn which cost me distance
2840167 its the olympics and you try and you do anything you can to get an advantage on your opponent and most of the fleet try and give me a hard time when they can
2840168 its difficult because in my position i just want to stay out of trouble and it almost forces you to be too cautious as i ended up giving away quite a lot of distance but its the nature of the olympics and as i have learnt in the past you have to keep your nose clean and stay out of trouble
2840169 it was a really tough day with a lot of changes happening on the course and the lead changing up and down but our processes as ever helped us during the race and at crucial times
2840170 were very happy but you cant win it on the first day everyone says that in sport
2840171 we were obviously pretty nervous being our first olympics but we tried not to freak out and not forget the basics and i think we did that
2840172 i expected to be about 20 points behind the australians after the dressage with the germans and americans currently second and third in the mix now the pressure is on them its for them to lose and us to win
2840173 he could have done much better much better if he had not been spooked by the flower pots
2840174 the whole atmosphere was pretty frightening for the horse but you just have to try and ride your best
2840175 i am really really happy because we have a great team
2840176 she was a lovely girl the news of her death is a shattering blow to the whole family riding was emmas passion in life it was her raison detre and she was exceptionally talented eventing is such a dangerous sport but emma was so passionate about it that i would never have wanted to stand in her way it was her life all through university she would come all the way home almost every other day to train with her horse
2840177 i didnt know emma but this is very sad my sympathies are with her family and friends
2840178 i hope that it will spark the whole team into life
2840179 we have seen solid performances but no fireworks yet so hopefully they will start now its relatively early on to get a gold medal and that was a really important medal because expectations are very high but i hope that will help the team reach the level that i believe they are
2840180 it was a brilliantly ridden race by nicole but for once we had people in with her who could support her emma pooleys attack was absolutely critical and to see three women riding like that for britain was fantastic
2840181 you always want to get an early medal because it gives confidence to the whole of the team and it doesnt get much better than gold on day two of the games
2840182 we have a medal board here but we dont erect it until we have something to put on it but it is up now and every time the team walk in or out of the accommodation they will see nicole cookes name
2840183 im very happy with what i have seen so far weve had three boxers fight and all three have made the second round we had really good performances at the rowing lake with the womens quad qualifying straight through and both badminton players won but the fillip that comes from this for the overall team could be really valuable
2840184 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2840185 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2840186 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2840187 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2840188 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2840189 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2840190 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2840191 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2840192 i say we move to wisconsin everybody is weird there
2840193 we could just toss the body in the water with a ball around his feet retend the mob did it

2840210 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
2840211 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
2840212 he also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people
2840213 wants to speaks directly to the pakistani people and chose english because he cannot speak urdu

2840243 im just going to try and take it easy on him for a while so we dont lose him again
2840244 i wont be stealing any bases but aside from that ill be all right
2840245 maybe it will change here or there but thats where i want him to hit
2840246 he was in that spot before he got hurt and well just put him back in there
2840247 a common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools

2840293 id like to say straightaway that regime change is an american expression

2840316 janganlah kamu menjadi serupa dengan dunia ini tetapi berubahlah oleh pembaharuan budimu sehingga kamu dapat membedakan manakah kehendak allah apa yang baik yang berkenan kepada allah dan yang sempurna

2840330 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and values
2840331 how we could give some life to this contrast without turning negative

2840337 thats been so difficult for me to keep under wraps because watchmen is my favorite comic of all time so when zack had asked us to do the song for watchmen the end credit song and the single for the movie we were floored and when he said it was going to be a dylan cover that he wanted that was so amazing
2840338 300 director also revealed to us the movie is going to stay true to its decades spanning source material by using no music written after 1985
2840339 it has so many amazing lyrics but ive picked my four favorite verses we wanted the song to feel like a product not of its era but of the movies so its recorded and performed in a very early 80s punk style similar to the sex pistols or the ramones thats what it feels like its a dirty punk song
2840340 its really inspired by james carrolls version of people who died
2840341 when i brought that up to zack he said thats in the end credits to snyders remake of
2840342 on three cheers for sweet revenge the third single ghost of you comes from the ad in watchmen for nostalgia that says oh how the ghost of you clings
2840343 you dont really find my chemical romance songs in films i believe one was in the end credits to house of wax or something at some point but other projects were never right for us watchmen is right for us

2840356 the new national quality framework needs to be ambitious comprehensive and easy to understand
2840357 these public consultations will provide invaluable feedback on what the framework should look like

2840361 that is why i am pleased to be opening of feros cares new 5 9 million extension of 19 high care places
2840362 six of these new 19 places came on line in june and a further 13 places will become operational next week
2840363 the facility will then have a total of 64 care places including 16 extra service status places
2840364 two cottages provide general high level care including six places for veterans and two respite rooms another cottage has a secure dementia area and the fourth cottage provides a range of extra services which residents can choose to have at an additional cost

2840366 in addition feros is part of the greater far north coast community as it provides community care and respite care for employed carers in this region through a pilot model

2840378 the government is committed to working with industry so that our decisions are implemented with the lowest possible compliance costs weve carefully listened to both industry and community feedback during the public consultation process and as a result weve decided to significantly modify the administration of the temporary residents superannuation policy
2840379 this new administrative approach produces a fairer outcome for temporary residents as their superannuation will remain in their fund while they are in australia rather than being swept out annually and they will continue to be able to take their superannuation with them when they depart
2840380 departed temporary residents will also be able to claim back at any time any superannuation that has been paid to the commonwealth

2840427 i bear you witness to our promise to allah that we ourselves will not abandon our weapons and will never stop our jihad and will never abandon our belief and will not abandon andalusia sebta melilla bosnia kosovo cyprus jerusalem haifa um rashrash baghdad kabul and kashmir and grozny even if they have many conferences in oslo or annapolis and one thousand conferences in london and salah al din do not let the eyes of the cowardly sleep
2840428 although our tragedy in your killing of our women and children is a very great one it paled when you went overboard in your unbelief and freed yourselves of the etiquettes of dispute and fighting and went to the extent of publishing these insulting drawings this is the greater and more serious tragedy and reckoning for it will be more severe in closing i tell you if there is no check on the freedom of your words then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions
2840429 palestine has been suffering greatly for roughly a century at the hands of the christians and jews and both opponents did not take it from us through negotiations and dialogue but through iron and fire and it is this way to bring it back for iron can meet iron and allah showed us the way to destroy the hardiness of infidels
2840430 the maritime warfare exercises conducted between the ran and visiting navies have provided vital experiences for all involved the opportunity to work together to improve combined maritime warfare procedures and tactics has been invaluable
2840431 i thank the people of darwin and the northern territory for their support during it is a beautiful part of the world to exercise in
2840432 the kakadu series exercises every second year in the top end the navy is looking forward to exercising with our international allies again in 2010
2840433 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
2840434 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorizing their emplacement across the province
2840435 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12
2840436 finding one man intent on remaining hidden within a province measuring more than 22 500km2 is no easy feat
2840437 conducting an operation to capture him without loss of life is even more difficult and the success of this operation speaks volumes for the inherent capability within the sotg s special forces with support from the afghan national army and isaf have refined the process of identifying those in oruzgan who continue to wage their campaign of terror
2840438 i have been promoting australian defence industry capabilities to our allies and i think there are further global market opportunities for the bushmaster vehicle
2840439 at least one other european country is known to have a requirement for vehicles of the bushmaster type and presents a potential market opportunity
2840440 the bushmaster is currently deployed overseas with the adf and it has performed remarkably well operators of the vehicle have commented to me on both its high level of operational performance and protection level
2840441 the adf has world class skills expertise and capability in conducting explosive ordnance disposal and is happy to be assisting our regional neighbour with this important work
2840442 the review will study the mental health care needs of adf personnel and the ex service community and assist us in ensuring the very best care is available
2840443 the number of recent deployments make it essential that both dva and defence work together to support those who have returned from active duty particularly those service personnel who are then seeking to transition to civilian life

2840456 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2840457 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2840458 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2840459 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2840460 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2840461 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2840462 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2840463 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2840477 once a year we file with the s c public service commission to review the fuel component of electric rates
2840478 rate adjustments are based on the actual cost we pay for fuel
2840479 if that increases the price we charge customers increases and when the rate of energy goes down its reflective in what our customers pay as well
2840480 our cost for power is going up and we certainly try to manage that
2840481 in 2009 costs the prices the company pays for fuel will be changing more drastically than they are now
2840482 without these increases it would put us in the hole

2840504 once again i am appalled at the revelations surrounding the delaware psychiatric center we are talking about employees allegedly taking advantage at the very least of individuals who are among our most vulnerable population the mentally ill what will it take before the governor agrees that secretary meconi is grossly incompetent and the patients at the dpc deserve much much better we need accountability and simply changing policies in response to theft abuse and outright crimes is not leadership in the opinion of most reasonable people
2840505 i wish i was more confident that the governor would do the right thing but unfortunately judging from the past i expect shell make no changes in leadership at dhss given that i hope these multiple failures at the dpc will not be forgotten if secretary meconi is considered for a cabinet position by our next governor whomever that may be
2840506 i plan to contact the u s attorneys office to see if there is anything the federael government can do to restore some level of public trust and accountability to this institution the patients and their families the many good and competent employees of the dpc and the citizens of delaware deserve better the answer to these ongoing and repeated cases of abuse and neglect is not a new building

2840652 at the rare sunday session of the council called jointly by the united states and georgia u s ambassador zalmay khalilzad questioned russias motives in sending some 10 000 troops into south ossetia in recent days to prevent georgia from reasserting control over the russian backed breakaway region
2840653 russia has claimed that its military operations were intended to protect its peacekeepers and the civilian population in south ossetia yet its reaction goes far beyond any reasonable measures required to do so indeed its escalation of the conflict has been the immediate cause of increased loss of innocent life and humanitarian suffering

2840707 the trees are older and people are right there among them
2840708 when you hit a decayed area or cavity it basically sounds drumlike
2840709 thats the scary part because you just dont know how much sound wood remains in the circumference of the trunk
2840710 we generally only remove weak trees that are both in peril of falling and will likely hit a person or property when they go
2840711 a dead or damaged standing tree still plays an important role in the forest as a place for birds to nest for example this is also why we try to leave trees on the ground when they fall in a natural area
2840712 in what looks like the latest crisis to strike indias food bowl migrant labourers who earlier came in hordes to till punjabs unending agricultural lands have suddenly disappeared forcing landlords to stop short of kidnapping them from railway stations and bus stops
2840713 today i promised them rs 1 500 per acre for transplanting the paddy nursery in 10 acres just two days days back i had paid them rs 1 200 per acre and this when i tell them that i will add to it if there work is good just imagine the same work used to cost just me under rs 600 per acre till last year
2840714 when the migratory labourers can find equally profitable work at their doorsteps why should they be travelling long distances and suffer back breaking work in other states where often they are treated as second class citizens
2840715 earlier the labour force used to come to punjab sometime by march end at the beginning of the harvesting season and would stay put till paddy sowing was complete by july end this assured them ample work for nearly four months but increased mechanization of farm operations especially in wheat production has reduced the duration of employability for them and predictably of the work force has shown a dwindling trend since the past six years or so
2840716 focusing on support structures at the panchayat village council and block level can actually help a working system that can allow panchayats to become an effective tier of local self governance the nregs has been one of the biggest programmes to combat rural poverty its legal guarantees have radically altered the relationship of the poor with the state
2840717 absurdly the nrega bans machines and contractors this was supposedly a move to prevent the exploitation of villagers but it is only serving to keep them in the dark ages even as we talk of a new urban india whether it is digging ponds making or repairing roads or building check dams all these are achieved manually the worlds largest social security scheme is only creating millions of labourers

2840719 we used to get rs 60 to rs 80 after a whole day in the field now we get the full payment without having to argue or haggle
2840720 i wish this would go on instead of limiting work to 100 days a year
2840721 people here have waited four months to get much less than what was owed to them

2840723 villagers who are the beneficiaries of the national rural employment guarantee scheme nregs are complaining that the wages paid to them have been gradually reduced much to their disappointment on friday last about 3 000 workers resorted to picketing in dindigul on monday the villagers of chettinayakkanpatti came to the collectorate in large numbers to submit a petition against the low wages being paid to them under the programme they said that originally the daily wages they received was rs 80 but it was reduced to rs 70 and 65 and finally now they were paid only rs 45 as wages workers argue that the officials were adopting impossible measures to assess the quantum of work done by them in order to deny them the guaranteed wages
2840724 and that is why so many people begin their description of gurgaon by saying the thing about this place is its really a gaon gaon village
2840725 there is an urban gurgaon touted as indias millennium city and a rural gurgaon largely seen as a cluster of villages and though the stark divide between the old and new gurgaon as represented in these two voices may appear to be nothing new the recent killing of a 14 year old boy in an upscale gurgaon school by his own classmates has brought the underlying tensions of these two gurgaons into the open the fact that the victim and the two accused hail from rural but well to do families has given gurgaons more urban residents a chance to vent out their true feelings about their rural counterparts the lure of skyrocketing property prices made big land owners from nearby villages of gurgaon sell their land and move to the city to give their children a better life but the urban residents say they have also brought along with them their own regressive mindsets
2840726 my plan emphasizes lowering costs not only setting up a government plan so that people who dont have health insurance can buy into it and will get subsidized but also making sure that those who have health insurance but are struggling with rising co payments deductibles premiums under bush families are paying 78 more on health care than they were previously we put in a catastrophic re insurance plan that will help reduce those premiums for families by an average of about 2 500 per year every expert thats looked at this has said there is not a single person out there whos going to want health care who will not get it under my plan my plan also says children will be able to stay on the parents plan up until the age of 25
2840727 last year the medicaid inflation was 10 no program in the world can survive under that so of course we want to remove the employer tax and tax incentives and move it to the individual give the individual a 2 500 refundable tax credit a family a 5 000 tax credit if you need to have people in special categories such as congenital diseases we may have to set up a fund to care for those but the key is make health care in america affordable and available dont destroy it as the democrats want to do
2840728 the problem with health care in america its not the quality it is the inflation in all due respect to your expert that we just saw hes talking about the wrong aspect of this issue the right aspect of this issue is inflation if we could get it under control and get it reduced so that health care costs are reasonable then those people will be able to afford it they will be able to go out and choose their insurer and they will be able to then to get affordable health care
2840729 mr mccains health care plan would shift the emphasis from insurance provided by employers to insurance bought by individuals to foster competition and drive down prices to do so he is calling for eliminating the tax breaks that currently encourage employers to provide health insurance for their workers and replacing them with 5 000 tax credits for families to buy their own insurance his proposal to move away from employer based coverage was similar to one that president bush pushed for last year to little effect and his call for expanding coverage through market based competition is in stark contrast to the democrats proposals to move toward universal health care coverage with government subsidies to help lower income people afford their premiums

2840737 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2840738 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2840739 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it

2840760 this is a very exciting study because we are looking at a drug called dimebon that has the potential to be a much better treatment for alzheimers than we have right now
2840761 its sort of like a band aid the drugs that are out there now this one would actually be not a cure of course but it would actually potentially halt some of the progression of the disease
2840762 the study is a six month study where its placebo controlled so subjects could be taking the placebo or they could be taking the drug dimebon in one of two different doses
2840763 its a big deal because on both sides of the family we have alzheimers so myself and my three siblings we are potentially good candidates to have some sort of dementia later on in life
2840764 pero tambi n aspiro a que la defensa sea como la de los ltimos semestres quiero que vuelva a ser la misma defensa pero de cinco jugadores que la compon an no tengo a dos jugadores ni a michel ni a maza rodr guez y si te quitan dos jugadores pierdes un 40 por ciento
2840765 el equipo va creciendo a pesar de que los resultados nos han llegado como quisi ramos pero el equipo va en aumento de nivel de manera importante el partido de ayer fue muy bien planificado llevado pr cticamente al pie de la letra nulificamos a un equipo que se mueve bien que eso es muy importante en ofensiva y creo que los tuvimos en la palma de la mano desafortunadamente esa desatenci n nos cost el empate como contra cruz azul y tecos y creo que estamos en un nivel que con peque os ajustes el equipo dar el paso que necesita dar para conseguir las victorias
2840766 la verdad que estamos conscientes de eso que uno prefiere mantener el invicto ganando que empatando porque cuando igualas siento que vas perdiendo dos puntos y se dejan ir muchos puntos ya queremos sumar de a tres porque de nuestro grupo todos han sumado de tres y no nos queremos quedar atr s
2840767 nosotros tenemos que provocar m s opciones de gol para poder estar m s tranquilos en el marcador no nos desesperamos pero s te pones a pensar en muchas cosas uno trabaja bien para que salgan los resultados y tenemos que analizar el por qu no se nos han dado los triunfos si ante cruz azul no empatan de ltimo minuto tecos igual dejamos ir opciones de gol y de nueva cuenta ante monterrey perdemos una ventaja y creo que si mantenemos el cero podemos estar arriba en el marcador
2840768 nos equivocamos el equipo no sali cuando tuvo la oportunidad
2840769 dejen el punto me duele m s la forma como se pierden las cosas porque el equipo ten a una estrategia para enfrentar a pumas estaba resultando adecuadamente estaba faltando sacar la pelota desde atr s con mayor velocidad despu s nos equivocamos el equipo no sali cuando tuvo la oportunidad y tuvimos a pumas encima mucho tiempo
2840770 el equipo ten a que dejar venir a pumas un poco para salir a velocidad el equipo lo estaba haciendo bien pero en el segundo tiempo perdimos pelotas tontas no tuvimos la posesi n para tener la pelota enfrente de ellos a pesar de ello hubo un par de jugadas donde llegamos con cierta claridad pero tenemos que ser m s constante no nada m s a ratos
2840771 hay muchas cosas que corregir eso lo tengo claro tambi n hay cosas que me gustaron como el hecho de hacer el gol como pensamos que pod amos hacerlo era algo que ten amos planeado
2840772 el rival siempre tiene m ritos eso est claro pero yo siempre doy m s atenci n a mi equipo
2840773 contento por los minutos que se me dieron ayer esperemos jugar m s pero lo importante es que el equipo salga adelante
2840774 uno siempre trata de hacer lo mejor cuando entra a la cancha yo entr a hacer lo que me pidi el profe efra n flores pero desafortunadamente una gran jugada de ellos nos sacaron el empate tranquilo es una posici n que no desconozco desde fuerzas b sicas me han ense ado a jugar varias posiciones creo que una de mis habilidades es tener adaptaci n en cada posici n

2840791 the coin must have been done by a professional the work is impressive
2840792 in soccer or other sports competitions it is very easy to monitor performance first there are clear results second each performance is carried out openly it is all transparent you see who did what with what result in the world of business and politics however it is not easy to see a clear cut line between performance and result the goalkeeper in this case could hide his shortcomings for years if he knows how to place the corporate office game his skill set lies in corporate ladder climbing not in function performance after awhile those whose main skills are social climbing could find themselves at the head of large organizations but without the skills you will get the kind of corporate crashes we have seen for at least decades now
2840793 you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their high officials exercise authority over them not so with you instead whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wants to be first must be your slave just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many

2840800 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2840801 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2840802 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2840803 i mean look i had five dunks in one game the last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 thats all because of the energy of this crowd

2840806 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2840807 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2840808 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2840817 her strong guidance skilled leadership and counsel have been invaluable to me during my tenure as dnc chair and to the democratic party as a whole i am confident that leah will play a key role in the success of this important event the democratic national convention that will help us elect the next democratic president of the united states

2840820 we had two very important groups of people in the dnc disagreeing with each other
2840821 and i wanted to achieve it in a way that wasnt offensive to the history of the civil rights movement
2840822 i believe as the church believes that marriage is intended for one man and one woman
2840823 as a lifelong loyal democrat i am filing this complaint against the dnc because the road to social justice sometimes demands that our political family and friends be held accountable when they do not act for the common good respecting the democrats opportunity to regain the majority in both houses of congress i remained silent throughout the last year about my illegal termination and subsequent ongoing defamation from the dnc prior to filing this lawsuit i tried several times to settle this matter in a reasonable and professional manner but the dnc refused and continues to attempt to discredit me and my political opinions prior to my position at the dnc i worked for 10 years advocating for equality for the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt community when i was recruited by the dnc to serve as the director of its gay and lesbian leadership council i was told that my professional and activist background would be helpful to achieving governor deans goals once i joined the dnc however senior staff made it clear that they had no interest in lgbt equality instead democratic lgbt constituents and employees are treated as second class citizens whom the dnc tries to ignore unless fundraising is involved reducing the community to a little more than an atm as a dnc employee i tried to push the organization to treat the lgbt community with greater respect the dnc ultimately terminated me after my long term partner criticized the democrats lack of a strategy to combat anti gay ballot measures a critique made without my input and which the dnc recently admitted was accurate it is clear that the dnc fundraisers have no intention of ceasing their personal attacks against me their goal is to keep lgbt money flowing to the dnc no matter what for some if truth is not convenient they find it expendable for the cause they have spent time researching my political and charitable contributions and even claimed publicly that i was not a loyal democrat since i did not donate a part of my salary back to the party social justice is not for sale nor should it have to be bought the lgbt press has rightly criticized the dnc for its failure to recognize and promote basic human rights for the community rather than respond to legitimate questions about dnc policy and strategy impacting the lgbt community the dnc has retaliated against publications and former employees by attacking the messengers personally the dnc now has fewer openly gay and lesbian members than before the 2004 election this is not progress i expect my party to embody the democratic values of fairness and honesty it is important that the dnc be able to acknowledge its failings and live up to its promise to protect the human rights of the lgbt community as we move forward to help attain this goal i cannot remain silent on matters of policy and substance

2840839 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

2840859 my mind isnt going so far as i can tell but its changing
2840860 the report documents a disturbing decline in reading habits of americans over the past twenty years or so
2840861 some cultural observers have suggested that this decline in reading is evidence of a broader loss of interest in verbal communication due to the fact that were now much more adept at visual communication
2840862 some i am sure will point out that the mode of communication has shifted from the antiquated print culture to our current internet society now we have a visual culture and are taking in information differently but taking in mere information does not mean we are deeply engaged with the content we may be able to scan for multifarious sensory input and gather unreliable but perhaps important bits and pieces in our junkyard of amassed headlines but the type of mental wrestling that reading a good book brings are irreplaceable
2840863 is without question the most powerful informational technology thats been invented since the phonetic alphabet the problem is that what the internet seems to do judging from our data is give you information in pictures captions headlines icons pieces of information its clear that what reading does is something different i think it has at least two enormous impacts first of all reading requires sustained focused attention the development of a line of information across a great span of time ten minutes a half hour an hour which allows you to convey information of complexity or interrelatedness that would be very difficult in a more atomized medium secondly since reading does not give you the image the background music these things that film television and increasingly the internet does it requires you to use your memory your imagination so it develops a sense of creativity and i think this is the crucial element a degree of inner life that does not seem to come from the other media as powerfully now this is a bold claim but i would maintain that every other piece of data in this report suggests that this hypothesis is accurate whey else would people who read volunteer at nearly four times the rate of people who dont read why would the poorest people in america who dont read do volunteer work at twice the level of the richest people who dont read why do readers vote more why do readers become invovled in almost every type of civic and social activity at a higher level than people who simply watch television and go to the internet now the interesting thing is that people who read do absolutely everything that people who dont read do they watch tv they play video games they go to the internet they listen to radio but they balance those things and they read they also seem to have more human time in a funny way than non readers its interesting we have a lot of data that just shows you that somehow reading awakens you not only to a deeper sense of yourself but to a deeper sense of the reality of other peoples lives spending nearly four years working through this data i have fundamentally changed my own opinions of reading i would have thought early on that reading was a largely private and personal activity something that was very important for nourishing your innner life developing ideas or maybe increading your sense of your own individuality it is now absolutely clear to me that while all of that is true thats only half the picture reading is actually an enormously powerful social activity that tends to by awakening a bigger sense of your individuality and your individual destiny also encourages you to link with other people for example a novel by meditating on the daily existence of another fictional person in their quotidian existence socially psychologically economically in terms of their race and gender and social class gives you the imaginative ability to make a sympathetic projection into the reality of someone elses life that changes your relationship to other people forever theres a great awakening almost a religious experience that happens in peoples imaginations
2840864 the act of reading makes the same sorts of demands on us that life does namely to make sense of things where any number of meanings are possible and where final meaning is lacking how can we presume to know ourselves if we dont know how to read i mean read carefully complexly alertly with the lightfootedness of the dancer instead of the heavy plod of the logician we live in an age that hates ambiguity and militates against uncertainty the more complex the world becomes the more we seek out easy simplifications we want a clear distinction between good and evil we want to judge before we understand literature doesnt let us get away with that at least not when we meet it on its own terms i think its because were so much in favor of anything that reduces and simplifies that so many of us these days prefer movies to books the difference between a book and a movie is the difference between a cube and a square if you cast a light on a cube and project its shadow on the wall you reduce it from a three dimensional object to a two dimensional square while the square is comprehensible from the perspective of the cube the reverse is not true the square cannot comperehend the cubes third dimension the same applies to books and movies movies for the most part take the cube of literature and project it onto a screen where it becomes a square and we sit there in the projection hall like platos prisoners in their cave watching shadows flicker across the screen and were content with the show literature which gets inside our heads is sometimes too three dimensional for us
2840865 it felt very similar to reading a great work of literature coming across these great english words hidden in the depths of the english language one thing that i find so interesting about coming across these forgotten words is that ill think about the thing they describe more often for instance the beautiful word petracore which describes a sort of warm lonely smell that comes off the pavement when it first rains ive always loved that smell when it first starts raining i dont talk about it quite as much but i think about it often when i come across that gentle smell wafting off the ground
2840866 i did try to read straight through the oed online however i just felt physically ill a large part of the appeal of this project was just that i love reading the tactile sensation of turning one page to the next and feeling my fingers across them i love feeling the weight of the book in my lap i like the way the books smell thats a huge part of it in fact the first thing i do with a new book is i like to open it up and take a sniff of the pages these are all sensations you can get from a book that you cant get from a computer

2840870 i got used to it so far no problems people like the car on the freeway people like this car everywhere so people react positive ly
2840871 we have great new battery technology these days thats why i am absolutely sure that the electric car is going to pick up

2840878 its well below inflation rates and that would mean that if ambulance paramedics accepted that offer than they would be falling behind over the next four years

2840881 the australian chamber of commerce and industry and the business council of australia have called for greater emphasis to be placed on what theyre calling employability skills and they are things like communication problem solving planning and organising teamwork developing skills for life
2840882 what were hoping for today is to start a conversation nationally about what we should expect every student to achieve what are the basics how can we set minimum expectations for all students
2840883 he insults journalists and journalism at virtually every whistle stop on his tour
2840884 he says its not about democracy its about profits the american public and policy makers have to decide whether journalism is produced purely for the reaping of profit or if its a central component to a functioning participatory democracy
2840885 you make policy accordingly there is no such thing as a deregulated media policy system the only question is will the media be regulated for the largest media corporations or regulated on behalf of the american public thats what all of our anticonsolidation efforts are about
2840886 what the hard core reformistas really want it seems is not diversity or an open debate but a media that promotes their own vision of society and the world
2840887 media reform cannot win without widespread support and such support needs to be organized as part of a broad anti corporate pro democracy movement
2840888 to rip the veil off corporate power and to work so that social decision making and power may be made as enlightened and as egalitarian as possible
2840889 the need to promote an understanding of the urgency to assert public control over the media
2840890 our claim is simply that the media system produces vastly less of quality than it would if corporate and commercial pressures were lessened

2840894 hes everything any mommy anywhere whether they raised him or not could ever want
2840895 of course i wonder what it would be like if id stayed with my biological mom
2840896 but i have to truly believe that it was my destiny to go about life the way that it happened to go through adoption and go into another family i hope that ive enriched the lives of my adopted parents
2840897 there were just a lot of things happening at the time and i just felt that i couldnt handle the responsibility anymore
2840898 she did the best she thought she could but i think she felt like something was missing on our side that she knew she could not provide at that time
2840899 i counted down the days until they came and packed all my stuff in a suitcase and i was with the hoffa family from then on
2840900 i was just trying to fit in but i always felt there was this difference between me and my siblings
2840901 of course they accepted me 100 percent but there was always this sense of awkwardness and difference and it took a long time for me to get over it and fully adjust into the family
2840902 it definitely challenged me as a person to figure out a way to catch up as quick as i possibly could
2840903 and gave me the work ethic i needed to make it through middle school high school and college but also just to continue to work hard when i was done with all that
2840904 when i went to that first state championship and he out threw everybody by so far i just got chills all over me
2840905 i thought this kid was definitely destined to be something big from then on out nothing he did surprised me it totally amazed me but it didnt surprise me because i knew he could do it
2840906 i couldnt live my whole life like this i needed some peace in my mind
2840907 i really hope that you will contact me because i do care and have a genuine concern for you so please find it in your heart to contact me thanks reese
2840908 i was really concerned that if he found his birth mother and she did not want to be reunited with him that it would rip him up
2840909 and that was my fear i didnt want to say i was jealous but i was because this was my baby i just thank god that she gave birth to him so he could be part of my life it all worked out just fine
2840910 i wanted to meet somebody who gave me reese and i wanted to welcome her into the family
2840911 it gave me such peace to know that he was all right and the hoffas had taken him and they were such great people
2840912 i dont have one thought that i could have done the job that the hoffas did that i could have done as well for him im an older adult now and i think that every child needs the opportunity to grow up in a well built family and he did so i dont have any regrets about that he couldnt have done any better

2840977 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed
2840978 pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives

2840984 instead of using gimmicks to give the impression that hes doing something sen inhofe should take actions that will actually do something to deal with record gas prices were seeing here in oklahoma
2840985 new hampshire is one of the five seats we expect to win

2840988 water as we know it does not exist within our bodies
2840989 water in our bodies has different physical properties from ordinary bulk water because of the presence of proteins and other biomolecules proteins change the properties of water to perform particular tasks in different parts of our cells
2840990 while it is well known that water plays an important role in the folding process we usually only look at the motion of the protein
2840991 this is the first time weve been able to look at the motion of water molecules during the folding process
2840992 water can be viewed as a designer fluid in living cells
2840993 our experiments showed that the volume of active water was about the same size as that of the protein
2840994 we previously thought proteins would affect only those water molecules directly stuck to them
2840995 now we know proteins will affect a volume of water comparable to their own thats pretty amazing
2840996 while usurpation of learning and memory processes may support persistent seeking of abused drugs common synaptic mechanisms of natural and drug reinforcement have not been demonstrated
2840997 we suggest that neuroadaptations induced specifically by drug self administration may form a powerful memory that can be activated by drug associated cues
2840998 future studies are required to identify the exact mechanisms through which drugs of abuse alter neural circuitry that is normally accessed by naturally reinforcing events but is usurped by cocaine to persistently cement these synaptic adaptations perhaps ultimately leading to pathological drug seeking behavior
2840999 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
2841000 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
2841001 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
2841002 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect
2841003 nihs unique translational environment where researchers can pursue intellectual high risk out of the box thinking with high potential payoff enabled us to pursue this work
2841004 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
2841005 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
2841006 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
2841007 that led us to consider whether ampk activation was the critical trigger that allowed ppar delta to work
2841008 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
2841009 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
2841010 because herbs and spices have a very low calorie content and are relatively inexpensive theyre a great way to get a lot of antioxidant and anti inflammatory power into your diet
2841011 if you set up a good herb and spice cabinet and season your food liberally you could double or even triple the medicinal value of your meal without increasing the caloric content
2841012 culinary herbs and spices are all generally recognized as safe and have been time tested in the diet
2841013 indeed some of spices and herbals are now sold as food supplements because of their recognized health benefits
2841014 when you add herbs and spices to food you definitely provide yourself with additional benefits besides taste
2841015 baseline dopamine levels were 50 percent lower and stimulated dopamine release was significantly attenuated in the brain reward systems of obesity prone rats compared with obesity resistant rats defects in brain dopamine synthesis and release were evident in rats immediately after birth
2841016 previous research has demonstrated that food intake leads to an increase in the release of dopamine in the circuits that mediate the pleasurable aspects of eating
2841017 also chronic food deprivation resulting in decreased body weight leads to decreased dopamine levels therefore increased food intake may represent a compensatory attempt to restore baseline dopamine levels
2841018 these findings have important implications in our understanding of the obesity epidemic the notion that decreased dopamine signaling leads to increased feeding is compatible with the finding from human studies that obese individuals have reduced central dopamine receptors
2841019 we also measured regulators of dopamine synthesis and release in midbrain dopamine pathways
2841020 our molecular analysis suggests that the central dopamine deficits are most likely caused by reduced expression of the genes encoding two proteins one that is involved in dopamine synthesis and another that is a transporter responsible for packaging dopamine into vesicles from which it is later released upon stimulation
2841021 obesity has so far been approached mostly as a metabolic rather than as an addictive disorder and obesity research has primarily focused on brain systems that regulate body weight through the maintenance of energy balance the current study challenges this approach by focusing on brain pathways implicated in pleasure and reward these pathways could override energy balance and induce hyperphagia and obesity by altering the reward value of food particularly palatable high energy food very early in life
2841022 now we know why so many people stay addicted to food it fuels the mid brain pleasure machinery we eat not only for nourishment but also for pleasure this study provides the molecular link between eating and mental health
2841023 if you ever owned an amc pacer and you now drive a bmw you know the difference quality control can make thats what erdj5 does it recognizes when a protein has manufacturing defects and degrades it before it can be distributed
2841024 it insists on bmw quality when a honda would do for example some people carry a mutated version of the protein cftr the mutated protein is damaged but would still work fine if it were distributed but in some individuals the quality control mechanism insists on degrading it its the degradation of the protein not the mutation itself which causes cystic fibrosis were hoping this discovery will open up new avenues of research into treatments for cf
2841025 our model is proposing a way that the brain processes temporal information and how this can vary over time
2841026 positive excitatory feedback originating from recurrent connections between the cells
2841027 it seems like when youre in a more flexible brain state its easier for you to redirect your attention to new and important things
2841028 manganese is an element found naturally in the body in addition the manganese in the nanobialys is tied up so it stays with the particles making them very safe
2841029 when we looked at the particles with an electron microscope we saw they are round and flat with a dimple in the center like red blood cells but also a little irregular like bagels
2841030 i came across the word bialy which is a polish roll like a bagel without a hole that can be made with different toppings so i called the particles nanobialys
2841031 even though it seems that gadolinium affects only those with severe renal failure physicians have decided not to use gadolinium even in those with moderate renal failure
2841032 a lot of patients with diabetes or hypertension develop renal failure so that decision potentially affects many people our goal has always been that our nanoparticle technology should be able to help everyone and with a growing number of people having diabetes and related cardiovascular problems we knew we needed to find a substitute for gadolinium based particles nanobialys are our first step in that direction
2841033 were not sitting in the lab generating nanoparticles and then looking for what they could be used for
2841034 we see a medical problem and ask what kind of particle might overcome it and then try to create it

2841052 i have no doubt they wanted to target the pipeline there is nothing else here
2841053 it was terribly intense the smell of cordite spread everywhere i had to abandon my car and hide in a ditch but the jets werent interested in other targets
2841054 at the moment the pipeline is not running at any capacity because there was a fire
2841055 he made it this far to the nfl and then he had a bad turn with the injuries hes been battling for a long time rehabbing and trying to get back the fact he got as far as he did with his comeback is great in itself
2841056 its hard to see how it all turned out for him in the end thats the breaks still you dont even want to think about something like that happening because that could just as easily be you
2841057 after what i went through i realized that your career can end at any time without any warning
2841058 so you start enjoying everything about the game you cherish every carry every rep you get every practice every moment you realize just how much you miss the game when its taken away from you
2841059 you even like it when your coaches scream and holler thats how much you miss it
2841060 hes smart and has a love and passion for the game he knows so much about defense and how to dissect an offense im sure hes cleaned up his act a little bit since he came here but at ohio state he was a real character and a cut up
2841061 i think that the players feel better about themselves and their ability the fact that we have the offense coming back and weve added some guys to the defense is something that they feel good about i think collectively they feel good about the team the only difference that i see is that sometimes i have to rein these guys in because everybody tells them that they are going to the super bowl and we havent done anything yet so that is the only difference but we try to come out and practice and play hard and we will see how it develops

2841066 when i called them after the race it sounded like they had half the village in the house
2841067 we had our fingers crossed arms crossed everything crossed our son craig is in australia and we were keeping in touch via text when she crossed the line we went mad we spoke to her after the race and she was ecstatic we are so happy for her
2841068 im very excited it is such a fantastic achievement for nicole this was the ultimate goal for her
2841069 we had a lovely celebration in the village when she won the gold at the commonwealth games in manchester a few years ago and this will probably be a bigger party because its a long time since wales had an olympic gold medallist
2841070 she was about 10 and the first thing she said to me was that she wanted to be like sally hodge the welsh cyclist who almost became olympic champion well nicole has outdone sally
2841071 nicole was always a fighter she always had a look of grit and determination on her face come rain hail or snow she used to cycle the six miles to school and back every day

2841085 the programs at their best arent about putting a plaque on the wall of a building
2841086 rather they are about really a strong relationship where people from the business come and act as mentors in the schools
2841087 elders future will be built around its core network network related and complementary operations
2841088 we have evaluated assets and operations which are peripheral to that or which are unlikely to meet our performance targets
2841089 work is ongoing on other elements of the strategy enunciated by the board with the intention of further divestment of non core assets and realisation of capital within the current financial year
2841090 we need to be lifting retention to year twelve or equivalent
2841091 none of this is going to be easy but we need to make sure that young people are staying in education and coming out with skills
2841092 the essence of league tables is you take one little thing and whack it in a list and say thats all you need to know about your local school
2841093 what we want to know is very comprehensive information about who is in each school because that would tell you something about educational need
2841094 we need to know where that disadvantage lies and we need to know the best methods of addressing it
2841095 what we are better off identifying is the kind of extra value that education offers so that we measure the progress people are making not the raw results
2841096 all information other than those things of course that are subject to privacy provisions should be made open and accountable to parents to the broader community
2841097 but in the end the focus has to be on the child and how they are progressing and what we are doing to improve their educational outcomes
2841098 issues with the structure and scope of the new government are likely to take centre stage
2841099 the strong result for the year was driven by good sales and margin growth in pipelines and tradelink

2841109 there is a real crisis of modern foreign language teaching and learning on todays campuses

2841116 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point
2841117 some situations take courageous decisions with regard to the political future
2841118 sometimes there are democratically elected or semi democratically elected leaders who do things which create grave problems for their countries
2841119 so sometimes those leaders should contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2841120 russian ground troops armed invasion has already transformed into a full scale occupation of parts of georgian territory the process of extermination of georgian population and annihilation of georgias statehood is in full swing
2841121 what legal terms can be used to describe what has been done by the georgian leadership can we use ethnic cleansing for example when about one third of the population of south ossetia left it during several days and went north risking their lives is it ethnic cleansing or not now when 2 000 is killed out of the total population of 100 000 is it genocide or not how many civilians must die before we describe it as genocide

2841159 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities mr hotchkies said on the sidelines of a notorious annual defcon gathering of hackers in las vegas
2841160 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2841161 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty said hotchkies who saw a spike this year in the number of defcon attendees carrying macintosh laptops
2841162 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2841163 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple hotchkies said
2841164 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2841165 jail break because it liberates iphone models from the shackles of deals apple has with telecom giants providing exclusive service to the devices in varying countries
2841166 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software hotchkies said
2841167 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2841169 the body of a chinese man was found lying on a bed in the rear bedroom of the property and the body of a chinese woman was found lying on a bed in the front bedroom northumbria police said
2841170 police including senior crime officers pathologists and other specialists are now working to establish the circumstances surrounding the deaths and are conducting forensic examinations
2841171 the pair had both suffered significant head injuries said a police spokesman
2841172 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more said ishaopeng wu 31 a member of the chinese students and scholars association
2841173 but no one actually spoke in tongues in the bible
2841174 hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born
2841175 so none of the apostles nor any of the new testament saints ever spoke in some unknown heavenly jibber jabber but rather in their own native language
2841176 in acts 10 46 it was the same greek word for
2841177 the language or dialect used by a particular people distinct from that of other nations
2841178 however paul had the gift of tongues which is different from the miracle of tongues in acts 2
2841179 of the spirit are different from the miracles of god the
2841180 it is abundantly clear from revelation 7 9 that the word
2841181 again in sharp contrast we read in acts 2 6
2841182 the miracle of tongues in acts 2 allowed the multitudes from at least 16 different nations to
2841183 i am not being unkind thats exactly what paul said in 1st corinthians 14 23
2841184 the goofy rambling of incoherent utterances by charismatics today is nothing less than crazy
2841185 if speaking in tongues is evidence of salvation as pentecostals claim it is then why didnt john mention tongues even once in his epistles
2841186 for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross
2841187 and now father glorify me in your own presence with the glory that i had with you before the world existed
2841188 but now i am coming to you and these things i speak in the world that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves
2841189 but far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ by which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world
2841190 for i decided to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified
2841191 so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do all to the glory of god
2841192 if anyone would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me matthew 16 24 take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light

2841204 this is particularly true for london where the water and sewerage infrastructure is ageing there will be an inevitable impact on bills but even so we will be able to keep them below the industry average
2841205 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point
2841206 there will probably be guerilla warfare all over the country
2841207 but the russians are not letting them withdraw they are pursuing them and people are seeing this
2841208 trying to keep oxygen out of the air we breathe
2841209 were in the service of the mythology of a self invented character who became everything his vivid imagination could dream of and more
2841210 through the silent night alone and barefoot down the torch lit path of the appia antica on his way to marathon history
2841211 it had taken italy a million man army to defeat ethiopia but only one ethiopian soldier to conquer rome
2841212 the passing of our great poet mahmoud darwish the lover of palestine the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project and the brilliant national leader will leave a great gap in our political cultural and national lives
2841213 he represented the palestinian pain and experience since the nakba in 1948 when he was a child until the last breakaway when he suffered pain in his heart we wish that the absence of mahmoud darwish will be a reason to help to unite the palestinian people
2841214 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2841215 the georgian gambit of trying to push the russians out of its breakaway border territories seems to have had the opposite effect of consolidating russian control
2841216 and its still unclear whether this crisis can be contained with only the destruction and loss of life it has caused so far
2841217 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2841218 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2841219 president bush has talked with french president sarkozy whos also the head of the eu right now and officials say that the two men are on the same page and that sort of gives us a sense of the parameters of what they expect to have happen
2841220 they say that what they must see in georgia right now is a cease fire a de escalation on the part of the russians and respect for georgias territorial integrity so that gives you some sense of what the us and the wests position will be as they start to engage with the russians
2841221 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2841222 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2841223 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2841224 the reports from people is that its an absolute nightmare two kids delivering food made it out of south ossetia but their parents didnt and they dont know if they are alive or dead because phones are down

2841266 some very high percentage of the people in china are happy with their lot in life something around 80 percent
2841267 could it be because nbc paid china a billion dollars to cover the olympics and they cant afford to have their reporters and sportscasters kicked out for telling the truth about china so they have no choice but to cover up
2841268 the new pew global attitudes survey also finds that most chinese citizens polled rate many aspects of their own lives favorably including their family life their incomes and their jobs however levels of personal satisfaction are generally lower than the national measures and by global standards chinese contentment with family income and jobs is not especially high

2841436 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2841437 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2841438 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank
2841439 fatah elements who dominate the plos executive committee have a plan to prevent any attempt of approach between hamas and fatah
2841440 the idea that mothers are some how cheating the system by choosing to stay home looking after their kids rather than getting out there into the workforces is risible
2841441 we are heading in the right direction irrelevant of todays result but it was a disappointing one
2841442 whats really pleasing is that the players and the staff are really attacking the vision of the club hard to build a team up over time and bring a group through together
2841443 i spoke to them about what we learned out of today and thats the ability to play at your maximum and execute your game plan right from minute one
2841444 no matter who you play or where you play you have got to present yourself and play at your maximum and we didnt do that in the first half
2841445 it was a quite a disappointing first half the way we played our intensity around the ball wasnt good
2841446 their midfield really cleaned us up early in the game and gave them good opportunities
2841447 and when we had momentum we did make some crucial errors during the course of the game that cost us easy goals the other way that halted our momentum
2841448 we and the union leadership have been making consistent progress and have resolved most of the important issues
2841449 verizon is committed to continue negotiating as long as it takes to complete the process
2841450 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
2841451 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
2841452 he also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people
2841453 wants to speaks directly to the pakistani people and chose english because he cannot speak urdu
2841454 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd
2841455 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2841456 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2841457 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2841458 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
2841459 we withstood the storm we calmed down and we just played a lot better basketball
2841460 maybe this was our biggest mistake that we think on the floor that this can be continued you know
2841461 uma empresa com recursos de motiva o mas sem gest o de pessoas como uma mulher bonita e burra s til para mostrar para os outros
2841462 i knew isaac hayes personally i actually got a chance to go into the studio with him
2841463 mind playing tricks on me was originally my solo song i wrote three verses i wrote my verse and then bill took my last verse then willie d wrote his verse i produced that song i cant believe this s t i been f king with black moses forever i grew up in a music household thats all we jammed
2841464 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind
2841465 he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator he was a creative genius i shall never forget how in the height of his career he still had time to work and lend his celebrity to those of us much younger and at that time who were totally unknown even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2841466 first condolences to ike dirty his son and his entire family
2841467 thank god we were blessed with his music and his incredible work he truly made soul music bare to the bone im a better artist because of my mama playing his music
2841468 my views developed in the course of time but i have always believed in what i did and never acted against it
2841469 the soviet government had let the genie out of the bottle and however hard they tried later they couldnt put it back in
2841470 russia can neither be grasped by the mind nor measured by any common yardstick no attitude to her other than one of blind faith is admissible
2841471 broke russias back the red terror unleashed by its leaders their willingness to drown russia in blood is the first and foremost proof of it
2841472 the bitter russian experience which i have been studying and describing all my life will be for us a lesson that keeps us from new disastrous breakdowns
2841473 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2841474 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
2841475 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving
2841476 defence while lupin was teaching it or crouch i suppose otherwise transfiguration
2841477 someone should like transfiguration i can never seem to keep up
2841478 well besides being one of your dads best friends he taught you the patronus charm didnt he
2841479 all of your brothers play quidditch even percy sometimes and you were as excited as anyone at the world cup but ive never seen you play or even get on a broom
2841480 they never let me fly with them said i was too young or too small or just because im a girl
2841481 i cant possibly be a beater or a keeper by myself but the others i can do a bit i hung a barrel hoop from a bit of rope and if i set it swinging around then its a lot harder to get the quaffle through
2841482 i dont know i can do most of the stuff i see the school chasers do and i can catch our old snitch not as well as you can though
2841483 if you can do what gryffindors chasers do i bet youre pretty good
2841484 we should play sometime you can have a go on my firebolt if youd like
2841485 well any time after we get back to hogwarts i suppose cant fly here
2841486 it fits and it makes as much sense as anything
2841487 does it change anything if shes right for for us i mean
2841488 err no i dont think so i mean unless unless you think it should
2841489 it it doesnt really change anything if shes right does it i mean its horrible either way and i really cant say which is worse but but it doesnt matter their message was the same and so we you know it just means the same thing err for us
2841490 it can be different if you want it to be
2841491 you you dont have to if you dont want to
2841492 i mean i dont want to stop you if you want to keep on
2841493 its just not the same anymore everything is completely different
2841494 a very recent fourteen and youre only fifteen were practically engaged how how weird is that
2841495 were not engaged were just talking and going to diagon alley and hogsmeade we can do that for a while a few months maybe or whatever feels right and then then whatevers next
2841496 it can all be you know normal thats thats probably how it was or or might have been now we just know how it can end sort of
2841497 i want you to know i wish this could be easier
2841498 i want to get you a birthday present when we go to diagon alley something you really like
2841499 yes i do friends get each other birthday presents and youre my friend im sorry i didnt get you one in time for your birthday
2841500 i need to write my letter ill feel better when its done
2841501 should i would you like me to call you err baby
2841502 but not until you feel the way he did for for her
2841503 ill be here if your letter doesnt take too long
2841504 offered the best temporary measure to extricate the country from its worst situation
2841505 do you lock the contractor into what appears to be a reasonable price and lock them in as long as possible or do you secure a shorter contract and risk seeing the price dive recyclates go down as well as up a bit like investments
2841506 the markets will be making money out of the sale of recyclables and some councils will too not all are negotiating long term deals
2841507 we need to get the message to our authorities and say lets see what we can get out of this without taking silly risks
2841508 at the time it looked a good deal ten years later i would say never again
2841509 if i could get out of the long term contract i have inherited i would do that
2841510 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2841511 they told us to come out i dont know why but some of our guys are still out there in the fields
2841512 i want to go back if we lose south ossetia now it wont be for ever because we will never surrender our land
2841513 there is a lot of panic many people have left and i am thinking of joining them my bags are already packed
2841514 we are afraid that the russians will come here and kill us people would not go if we had a strong army but they dont believe in our army any more
2841515 i have left everything i dont even have another shirt if the russians stay then i can never return were afraid of what the russians can do
2841516 the russians will be here tomorrow they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now
2841517 we are operating normally nobody has disturbed us at all
2841518 i know that lots of my neighbours are dead i have no idea who is left
2841519 they have helped immensely in the baghdad area in particular to take down the al qaeda car bomb networks and other al qaeda operations in iraqs capital city so they have done a phenomenal job in that regard
2841520 they have exceptional initiative exceptional skill exceptional courage and i think exceptional savvy i cant say enough about how impressive they are in thinking on their feet
2841521 there were iraqi accommodations in basra there were coalition accommodations in basra there were deals
2841522 i was very upfront about that in fact when i came through london on the way home from congress in september and noted that thats how you end these kinds of endeavours sometimes the deals work out well and sometimes they dont and when they dont then you have to go back and rectify the situation
2841523 there is no question that the militia criminality and violence in basra had reached intolerable levels thats why prime minister maliki ordered the operation there
2841524 the early days there were dicey there is no question about it it was a fight
2841525 and once again i have reiterated the importance that we put on the british contribution
2841526 a number of countries in the region including iraq have concerns about some of the activities of iran
2841527 everyone is watching and waiting right now to see if in fact iran is going to continue to together with help from lebanese hezbollah train equip and fund organisations that are a destabilising force in iraq
2841528 every situation has its own context its own circumstances and the key of course is an accurate and nuanced understanding on the conditions of the situation and the crafting of an approach that is appropriate for that context
2841529 that approach first of all has to inform what we are doing in afghanistan we have to work with our colleagues our partners in pakistan as well as those in afghanistan in trying to graft a comprehensive approach for the entire region or that sub region
2841530 we are very actively analysing the situation and our various options
2841531 we think that both candidates having seen iraq recently have seen the progress that has been made are aware of the both the steps forward and the additional steps that need to be taken
2841532 who dares wins and they have exceptional initiative exceptional skill exceptional courage and i think just exceptional savvy i cant say enough about them actually about how impressive they are in just thinking on their feet
2841533 we have had many many cases of very important operations they have helped immensely in the baghdad area in particular to take down the al qaeda car bomb networks and other al qaeda operations in iraqs capital city so they have done a phenomenal job in that regard
2841534 there were iraqi accommodations in basra there were coalition accommodations in basra there were deals i was very up front about that in fact when i came through london on the way home from congress in september and noted that thats how you end these kinds of endeavours sometimes the deals work out well and sometimes they dont and when they dont then you have to go back and rectify the situation
2841535 it is an opinion that is still being formulated we are very actively analysing the situation and our various options we are working that pretty intensively we have been reviewing options for several months assessing what the best options are and trying to refine a recommendation to make at an appropriate moment
2841536 the biggest lesson that weve all relearnt and i think we relearn it periodically is that every situation is unique every situation has its own context its own circumstances and the key of course is an accurate and nuanced understanding of the conditions of the situation and then the crafting of an approach that is appropriate for that context within iraq for example what works in ramadi may not work in baquba you have to constantly assess and learn and adapt that approach first of all has to inform what we are doing in afghanistan
2841537 im going to bring this to you and by looking at it you tacitly agree that you are going to do the work i want done

2841549 federal law requires clarke county school administrators to offer students the choice to transfer out of low performing schools but educators lost one way to do that this year when four other districts balked at accepting students the law that requires school districts to give students the choice to transfer also encourages administrators to work out an arrangement with a neighboring district when in district transfers dont make sense for instance when every middle school qualifies as a low performing needs improvement school

2841554 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2841555 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2841556 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2841557 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2841558 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2841559 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2841560 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2841561 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2841562 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2841563 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2841564 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2841565 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president

2841593 its going to be one of the strongest linebacking corps in the middle with him and patrick
2841594 as far as football goes hes just a leader hes got that quality about him he knows his stuff he pays attention to his film study hes prepared hes the type of guy you need on a defense thats a plus
2841595 i think it showed some glimpses of what i can do
2841596 im still learning the defense it was a solid game
2841597 they say this cat shaft is a bad mother shut your mouth

2841600 he also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people

2841607 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2841608 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2841609 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2841610 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2841611 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2841612 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2841613 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town

2841624 they came out with a lot of energy in the second practice i thought we played faster we didnt install anything new today and got a lot done in a short period of time
2841625 it was a day that we needed to look at him with the ones
2841626 he jumped in there and will give us great competition that is something well do tomorrow and i think that well have to use three guards throughout the season and certainly grayson is going to be one of them
2841627 we want to see guys do what we ask them to do we want to see guys play with full speed run hard to the ball on defense and execute on offense
2841628 i thought we came out fast on offense and made some plays
2841629 i didnt really like the way the defense started out then after halftime it kind of flipped the defense started running around and doing things right
2841630 i think hes playing at a faster speed than he did all spring
2841631 the offensive line is starting to play well together and is getting a good understanding of what we want to do we need to rush the passer better we showed some fatigue and showed some lack of toughness at times but we did show the ability to rush the passer its always harder on the defensive line when you arent hitting the quarterback because there are some times that you think that you would have had a sack and he still throws the ball
2841632 i really wanted to go outside they told me that it would quit raining in a little while so we warmed up inside and then came out for the scrimmage
2841633 oh my god ive always been a brett favre fan
2841634 and can you believe that in another month hes going to be out in our neighborhood in florham park
2841635 seismic activity during the past weeks had slightly increased as well as crater glow which had slightly intensified
2841636 the above observations show that mayon volcano is undergoing an episode of increased activity probably related to magma movement towards the crater or a post eruptive behavior of the volcano
2841637 the pdcc is now on 24 hour close watch as disaster avoidance precautionary measure
2841638 one of my personal favorite projects is education we will send very large number of students in the philippines the united states will fund the english training in timor so that when they come to the philippines they have very good solid english
2841639 we will strengthen our relations with president arroyo and we will sign some memorandum of agreement and cooperation in terms of education
2841640 i leave it to the philippines to decide whats the best course of action each country has each reality challenges and the philippines has been a very resilient country always moving forward despite many difficulties from within and without
2841641 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2841642 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2841643 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2841644 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2841645 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2841646 take the poetry of our hearts and turn it into prose
2841647 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2841648 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2841649 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2841652 if the tables and views specified in an sql routine body exist at the time the routine is created the name will first be checked as a column name if not found as a column it will then be checked as an sql variable name in the compound statement and then checked as an sql parameter name if the referenced tables or views do not exist at the time the routine is created the name will first be checked as an sql variable name in the compound statement and then as an sql parameter name if not found it will be assumed to be a column
2841653 if an sql statement contains an sql variable or parameter and a column reference with the same name db2 interprets the name as an sql variable or parameter name
2841654 if an sql statement contains an identifier with the same name as an sql variable and a column reference db2 interprets the identifier as a column
2841655 the statement is a syntax error if x could be any two of a parameter a variable a column
2841656 if n 1 true since there is only one identifier in the chain and
2841657 otherwise each possible scope tag shall be a range variable
2841658 the server gives up without notice when finding that an exception handler is invoked recursively
2841659 if there is no most appropriate handler and the condition is an exception condition then the sql statement raising the exception condition is terminated with that exception condition
2841660 mysql warnings are not the same beast as the sql standard warnings i e they have a different life cycle and they work with continue handlers differently at least now a mysql note could be considered a subtype of mysql warning only with a different severity
2841661 one should get a warning severity note for each database table that didnt exists
2841662 please be consistent say note level warnings not notes and warnings
2841663 were no longer arriving late but rather purchasing extra child care hours
2841664 a similar situation could occur under a cap and trade regime under cap and trade rules the government places an artificial cap on the amount of carbon each regulated facility may emit facilities producing more carbon than they are allowed are required to purchase additional credits to make up the difference the opportunity to purchase these credits creates a market where none previously existed as in the example of the fined parents the purchase of the right to emit greenhouse gases would likely reduce any stigma associated with doing so emission levels consequently could rise
2841665 al gore says the risk of catastrophic global warming is so great that americans should act immediately to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
2841666 the social stigma of carbon emissions grows stronger each day as this stigma grows companies are increasing their investments into research and technologies to reduce and store carbon if congress removes the stigma associated with these emissions by assigning a price to them it may not like the results

2841675 i couldnt believe it when i rang up to get accommodation for a day on the green and they told me there was a minimum two nights stay
2841676 i just think it is really rude to put on two nights minimum stay for a day on the green it is unfair just because it is a day on the green if it was the long weekend in october i could understand
2841677 traditionally weve always been quoted as being an exceptionally expensive area in the central west and have always maintained that
2841678 we maintain a more steady market than other areas because we dont oversupply the market
2841679 and for a very good reason it is due to the prosperity and the fact that mudgee is a very renowned town
2841680 its become a fairly prestigious country town the barrel of the west and mudgee is a growing town even though it is not a university town so the prices are absolutely indicative of the fact that people have a lot of confidence in the area if they dont want to live in sydney anymore

2841685 wattle flat and sofala rural fire service units arrived quickly but there was nothing much they could do
2841686 the cottage was engulfed in flames it was a savage fire from reports weve received
2841687 when the fire was put out firemen found the remains of a person inside
2841688 at this stage we are unable to positively identify the person weve established a crime scene for forensic examinations to be carried out inside the building
2841689 the cause of the fire will be established at this early stage the origin could have been a wood heater inside the house
2841690 this was a very old weatherboard house built for miners or fossickers one of the older buildings in town
2841691 i congratulate terry on his selection for such a prestigious fellowship and applaud his commitment to providing quality leadership to the teachers and students at dunedoo public school
2841692 this fellowship will allow terry to undertake research in aspects of school leadership in australia and overseas enabling him to enhance his leadership skills for the benefit of his school community

2841705 he told us it would be difficult but together we would be much stronger
2841706 it meant a tremendous amount to hear his voice and get leadership from him he has been the guy steering our squad we wish he could be here but we understand he needs to be with his family
2841707 we went into the match knowing this tragedy had happened but we also knew that we had invested four years and in some cases eight twelve sixteen years of our lives in this opportunity
2841708 we are taking all the security measures we can but it was a random act
2841709 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now

2841714 are you crazy why would you give up all you have to save someone else
2841715 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you
2841716 we can hold them for you the corner can i play with them during the show

2841724 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2841725 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2841726 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2841727 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2841728 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2841729 just so you all know we did set a record
2841730 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2841731 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2841732 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2841733 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2841734 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2841735 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2841736 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2841737 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2841738 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2841739 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2841740 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2841741 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2841742 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2841743 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2841744 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2841745 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2841746 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2841747 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2841748 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2841749 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2841750 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2841751 its a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise revenues in
2841752 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2841753 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2841754 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2841755 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2841756 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2841757 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2841758 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2841759 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2841760 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2841761 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2841762 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2841763 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2841764 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2841765 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2841766 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2841767 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2841768 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2841769 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2841770 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2841771 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2841772 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2841773 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2841774 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2841775 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2841776 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2841777 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2841778 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2841779 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2841780 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2841781 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2841782 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2841783 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2841784 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2841785 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2841786 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2841787 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2841788 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2841789 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2841790 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2841791 there will be more celebrities in denver than there were when the democratic convention was in los angeles eight years ago america understands celebrity and these people will be there to see obama it will help generate the kind of excitement we want to see
2841792 there will be photocalls with some of the bigger names and there are plans being worked out for ben affleck and matt damon to do some sort of gig on the stage
2841793 obama cant avoid hollywood even if he wanted to they have raised so much money for him
2841794 he was getting blasted last week for behaving like a blonde bimbo and what does he do he sends out gwyneth paltrow to do a get out the vote video it was like saying my blonde bimbo is better than yours
2841795 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2841796 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2841797 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2841798 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2841799 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2841800 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2841801 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2841802 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2841803 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2841804 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2841805 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2841806 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2841807 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2841808 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2841809 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2841810 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2841811 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2841812 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2841813 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2841814 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2841815 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2841816 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2841817 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2841818 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2841819 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2841820 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2841821 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2841822 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2841823 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2841824 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2841825 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2841826 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2841827 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2841828 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2841829 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2841830 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2841831 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2841832 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2841833 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2841834 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2841835 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2841836 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2841837 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2841838 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2841839 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2841840 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2841841 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2841842 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2841843 its always a mind blower when some startup fundamentally changes the rules in any category that is assumed to be mature
2841844 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2841845 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2841846 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2841847 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2841848 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2841849 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2841850 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2841851 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2841852 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2841853 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2841854 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2841855 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2841856 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2841857 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2841858 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2841859 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2841860 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2841861 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2841862 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2841863 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2841864 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2841865 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2841866 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2841867 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2841868 is designed to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
2841869 loony liberalism a kind of ideological m nage a trois between timothy leary karl marx and al gore
2841870 matriarchal environmentalist multicultural anti male anti family anti individual and public hygiene shibboleths are enforced by orwellian regulatory agencies commissions and tribunals better known as the smoke smut seat belt thought language and calorie police
2841871 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2841872 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2841873 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2841874 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2841875 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2841876 how do i increase the traffic to my rpg blog
2841877 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2841878 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs

2841895 how can it happen that the spiritual impulse and especially the inner schooling for which you are constantly providing stimulus and guidance bear so little fruit why do the people concerned give so little evidence of spiritual experience in spite of all the efforts why worst of all is the will for action for the carrying out of these spiritual impulses so weak

2841902 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2841903 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2841904 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2841905 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2841906 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2841907 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2841908 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2841909 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2841910 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2841911 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2841912 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2841913 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2841914 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2841915 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2841916 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power

2841921 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2841922 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2841923 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2841924 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2841925 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2841926 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2841927 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2841928 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2841929 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2841930 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2841931 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2841932 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2841933 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2841934 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2841935 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2841936 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2841937 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2841938 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2841939 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2841940 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2841941 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2841942 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2841943 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2841944 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2841945 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2841946 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2841947 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2841948 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2841949 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2841950 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2841951 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2841952 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2841953 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2841954 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2841955 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2841956 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2841957 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2841958 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2841959 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2841960 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2841961 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2841962 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2841963 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2841964 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2841965 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2841966 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2841967 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2841968 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2841969 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2841970 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2841971 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2841972 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2841973 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2841974 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2841975 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2841976 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2841977 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2841978 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2841979 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2841980 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2841981 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2841982 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2841983 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2841984 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2841985 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2841986 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2841987 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2841988 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2841989 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2841990 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2841991 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2841992 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2841993 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2841994 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2841995 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2841996 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2841997 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2841998 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2841999 one of the things i m constantly amazed at is how many web publishers miss one of the easiest ways to maximize their positioning in search engines by simply including the keywords that they d like to be found for in their post titles to put it bluntly when it comes to blog seo i believe that your page and post titles are incredibly important google in particularly seems to value the words in your title incredibly highly keep in mind that research shows that people search the web a lot for names of products and people and that they are often quite specific their searches if you re writing about something specific make your title reflect this
2842000 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

2842014 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2842015 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2842016 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2842017 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2842018 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2842019 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2842020 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2842021 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2842022 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2842023 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2842024 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2842025 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2842026 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2842027 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2842028 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2842029 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2842030 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2842031 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2842032 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2842033 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2842034 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2842035 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2842036 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2842037 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2842038 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2842039 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2842040 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2842041 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2842042 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2842043 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2842044 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2842045 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2842046 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2842047 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2842048 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2842049 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2842050 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2842051 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2842052 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2842053 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2842054 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2842055 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2842056 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2842057 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
2842058 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
2842059 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2842060 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2842061 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2842062 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2842063 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2842064 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2842065 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2842066 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2842067 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2842068 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2842069 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2842070 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2842071 if you leave youll be alone no one will save you
2842072 you will be lost to us you go to something you cannot understand you condemn yourself stay
2842073 you have deceived yourself and look how you are punished
2842074 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2842075 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2842076 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2842077 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2842078 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2842079 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2842080 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2842081 ok fine its ok you want the ipod fine let me take it out
2842082 im gonna shoot you man you want me to shoot you
2842083 look man im not stalling the wires are tangled get it yourself
2842084 thats a shakespeare umbreallla man do you really want that
2842085 master and margarita i guess they werent too interested in 1930s russian fiction
2842086 dude did you call and tell me you have mumps
2842087 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2842088 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2842089 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2842090 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2842091 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2842092 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2842093 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2842094 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2842095 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2842096 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2842097 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2842098 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2842099 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2842100 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2842101 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2842102 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2842103 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government

2842116 the very sad thing is there are people that one wouldnt readily categorize as being racist in any other situation that do feel that obama being president would
2842117 one thing about davis he has consistently blamed democrats for all the national and regional ills and now he blames them for not being re elected
2842118 taking a stand against chinas big redemptive pr show by declining to attend wouldve been consistent and coherent but complaining all the way to the show and even at his reception in china this morning smacks of incoherency bad manners and outright hypocrisy

2842133 i have trouble understanding the separation between the roane alliance a county government function supported by our tax dollars and the chamber of commerce
2842134 todays message is simple all the gobs have to do is wait long enough and the voters of this county will forget whatever transgressions may have angered them in the past
2842135 to shield itself from public accountability the white house crafted rules which ignored centuries of legal precedent and tossed aside even the barest semblance of justice in favor of a system automatically tilted toward the prosecution

2842147 h tr s ou quatro anos n o poderia ter feito isso
2842148 a gente sempre fica procurando o que errou faltou um pouco de agressividade mas acho que do esporte o bonito n o saber quem vai ser o vencedor

2842150 o professor deu uma sacudida na gente no intervalo sab amos desde o come o que pod amos conseguir esse resultado eu sempre digo quando a gente fecha o grupo vence o jogo n o s os 11 que v o come ar mas todos os jogadores que entraram em campo
2842151 a gente vinha jogando bem mas n o estava conseguindo as vit rias hoje domingo gra as a deus por m rito do grupo conseguimos um bom resultado
2842152 nosso time deu ra a e vontade e mostrou que tem condi es de sair dessa situa o

2842156 a gente sabe da qualidade dele sem d vida acrescentou ao setor

2842158 marcamos bem s que tomamos um gol de jogada lateral o problema que criamos pouco
2842159 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2842160 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2842161 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt

2842163 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2842164 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2842165 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2842166 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2842167 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2842168 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2842169 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2842170 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2842171 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2842181 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2842182 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2842183 we were expecting detroit and got chicago which is a good thing
2842184 i guess dali was in a hurry and didnt have time to prepare the ground for the figure properly
2842185 for someone who doesnt believe in my god you sure do use his name a lot
2842186 one should be aware that life sciences and atheism attracts them magically so you better beware
2842187 look what creative and strange things this beautiful biological brain can produce
2842188 i am the very model of a modern major general
2842189 with the possible exception of conservative right wing homophobic straight men who have sex with other men
2842190 gore is so dumb about science for now knowing its winter in antarctica we cant believe him on global warming etc etc
2842191 al gore tried to have a big rock concert in the middle of antarctic winter
2842192 im not a star and i dont want to be a star stars fall im an ordinary guy with an extraordinary job
2842193 even in this current climate where many airlines are reviewing their networks our team is always on the look out for potential routes that could do with added competition and where we can make a difference by bringing down over priced airfares
2842194 we have been watching the key sydney auckland route for some time as a logical expansion to our trans tasman operations and we are looking forward to adding more flights and affordable fares from sydney to vila and nadi
2842195 we are confident these new routes will do very well for us and do very well for tourism in general
2842196 this is really good news for passengers as they can enjoy the benefits of more choice and additional travel options it is good for tourism and good for sydney
2842197 sydney airport is the nations gateway and handles more than 10 million international passengers each year
2842198 its interesting you ask that today because im not as pleased as i have been saying i was when this thing started
2842199 some of our younger guys with jake lanefski making the stupid injury yesterday that hurts us stuart hines looked good early but now has kind of leveled off and hes got to pick it up
2842200 theyve maybe been a little overwhelmed with all the stuff weve put in we have put almost all of the offense in and now we have to start refocusing and see what we can do well and what we need to work on but we just havent performed consistently
2842201 hartline obviously has a clear edge and i would say there is more competition now for the no 2 spot with randall cobb involved i need one of those no 2 guys to step forward and be more consistent
2842202 black men could finally stand up and be men because heres black moses hes the epitome of black masculinity

2842206 sabemos que h jogadores no elenco para tirar o santos dessa situa o se fosse o contr rio seria pior mas tem que ir com calma sem partir para cima dos advers rios de qualquer forma
2842207 hoje o time n o apresentou um futebol t o bonito mas n o foi inferior ao n utico eles aproveitaram uma jogada de bola parada e foram mais felizes mas acho que o empate seria mais justo
2842208 eu sou funcion rio do clube e sinceramente n o me preocupo com as fofocas j assumi o time em outras oportunidades e dessa vez foi assim fui chamado e aceitei porque sou funcion rio do santos
2842209 n o vou ficar aqui acusando um jogador meu jamais farei isso o que importa que tivemos a chance de matar o jogo e n o o fizemos agora trabalhar
2842210 a equipe at que estava bem principalmente no primeiro tempo quando tivemos oportunidades claras para acabar com o jogo o jogo estava sob nosso dom nio mas a perdemos o fabinho e ficou complicado
2842211 o m rcio j fez grandes trabalhos nas categorias de base do clube e tem toda a nossa confian a trouxemos dois auxiliares que ele pediu o serginho chulapa e o nen belarmino e isso tamb m nos ajudar
2842212 al m disso temos dois refor os praticamente acertados para serem anunciados nesta semana precisamos esperar a assinatura do contrato e a anunciaremos para a imprensa
2842213 falou se que o m rcio sairia se perdesse hoje e isso um absurdo recebemos diversas ofertas de treinadores mas n o falamos com ningu m porque confiamos nele m rcio al m disso falou se sobre sal rios de jogadores como o fab o recebendo r 500 mil por m s isso uma irresponsabilidade com o jogador que tem fam lia isso n o verdade e o santos paga o que o atleta representa
2842214 o resultado foi justo nosso primeiro tempo foi melhor tivemos mais chances no segundo tempo eles o internacional cresceram e partiram para cima tivemos a possibilidade para encaixar o contra ataque mas n o conseguimos
2842215 n o f cil ganhar aqui no beira rio por isso acredito que esse empate foi bom para nossa equipe
2842216 fizemos uma partida equilibrada no primeiro tempo depois no segundo tempo eles fizeram algumas mudan as e exerceram forte press o sobre nossa equipe mas conseguimos segurar o time deles
2842217 o grupo n o estava confiante e nem podia estar eram oito jogos sem vencer e isso mexe com a cabe a de todo mundo trabalhei muito o psicol gico desde que eu cheguei procurei dar confian a aos atletas e mostrei a qualidade de cada um deles para que eles se sentissem bem novamente
2842218 a vit ria foi boa e eu fiquei muito feliz pelos tr s pontos conquistados mas todos que me conhecem sabem que n o vamos acomodar temos que trabalhar muito forte para sair da situa o que ainda muito complicada vamos recuperar a condi o f sica de alguns jogadores para que eles possam nos ajudar no decorrer da competi o
2842219 t nhamos jogadores naquela equipe que conseguiram dar um encaixe r pido como foi o caso do acosta sidny j lio c sar e geraldo agora n s vivemos uma outra hist ria e precisamos de refor os n o falo em nomes mas pelo menos um para cada setor do time
2842220 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2842221 you have to get focused and give it a go
2842222 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2842223 bristol and richmond are without a doubt my two favorite tracks on the schedule
2842224 i think we can do well at those two places and get ourselves locked into the chase in the process
2842225 i consider bristol and richmond real racing the kind most of us grew up on
2842226 weve been running pretty well but i really feel comfortable with those two places coming up
2842227 youd like to have things in hand before richmond because it gets a little crazy there when theres so much on the line and its such a tight track and all
2842228 activities in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
2842229 i think that god used this tragedy to strengthen our faith i truly believe that
2842230 ive been celibate for a year and starting to think i may never have sex again
2842231 its not something i planned but i just dont get asked out any more
2842232 men seem to look at me and think she went out with george clooney
2842233 there was a friendship in the beginning but they got closer after heath died
2842234 spike was there for michelle after the tragedy and he helped her get through some of the darkest days
2842235 right now theyre secretly playing house and seeing where things go but its serious enough that spike is the first love interest michelles introduced her daughter to since heaths death and hes so great with matilda thats one of the reasons michelle is falling so hard for him
2842236 i think many of our problems as a country would be solved if people had thick passports
2842237 theres just no substitute for actually going and seeing things
2842238 its still not my business i just stayed out of it so i dont know
2842239 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2842240 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2842241 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2842242 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2842243 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2842244 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2842245 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2842246 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2842247 training days can a healthy green lead the texans to the playoffs
2842248 colorado has dropped 19 places in the ranking over the last 30 years it levies every major tax but the rate on each is among the lowest in the country spending discipline in the form of a so called tabor taxpayer bill of rights has helped the state keep tax rates low
2842249 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2842250 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2842251 dividing the number of instance of profanity by the number of pages of the sites on which they appear then multiplying the result by 100 yields what might be called a profanity quotient
2842252 thats quite a disparity liberals are more than 12 times as likely to use profanity as conservatives on the web
2842253 more than likely it is a reflection of how things are offline conservatives especially those who are more religious are less likely to use profanity in their daily conversation
2842254 we realize we have failed you many times over the last year and here is our plan this year for fixing that please bear with us
2842255 ironically our biggest advance this year was with a plane that didnt fly
2842256 next year well be emphasizing fuel efficiency as the ultimate goal with planes that maintain the characteristics of practical aircraft
2842257 the push to develop a diesel engine is worthy because of the limited availability of aviation leaded fuels
2842258 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
2842259 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush
2842260 he should have been talking about veterans issues not his opponent
2842261 from the beginning i was so good mamma said shed forget i was there i slept through the night entertaining myself if i woke up and no one was around
2842262 well hun i know its my fault but at least weve still got this new kid right
2842263 we should get into the habit of reading inspirational books looking at inspirational pictures hearing inspirational music associating with inspirational friends
2842264 hey using ebay is like gambling and gambling is like using ebay
2842265 man i wish i could just run away or hide and make everyone go away
2842266 i cant wait i just want to go out and have fun
2842267 we hope the operations will resume sooner in the day
2842268 hopefully its going to be best for him because he was having problems with the range of motion in his shoulder
2842269 he was playing and not really being himself as far as swinging the bat so maybe this will give him a chance to in a couple of weeks get some more range of motion
2842270 wed like to see him back where he used to be as far as a power hitter a guy who drives in some runs
2842271 who knows if two weeks is going to be enough
2842272 i dont know hes had surgery on that arm and a lot of scar tissue in there so well just try to get him some more flexibility in there
2842273 the rehab is pretty intense digging pretty deep into the shoulder and the capsule trying to loosen up some tissue
2842274 when were doing that and im trying to play and swing a baseball bat at the same time were kind of counteracting what were doing
2842275 if we give it time to cool down a little bit and get in there and dig and get after that without having to swing the bat and undo it thats hopefully going to help it recover a little better
2842276 he was losing the barrel but now hes getting on top of the ball every good swing is inside the ball but the main thing for him is getting on top of it he struggled with it starting in the spring losing the barrel
2842277 i feel good at the plate i try to go up there and do my best im hitting the ball good and seeing the ball good so i think its confidence i just keep working and the confidence that tony gives me is important he never gave up on me
2842278 hillary clinton and president clinton are integral parts of our convention in denver
2842279 hillary clinton will be speaking tuesday night in prime time president clinton will be speaking wednesday night their people are not only welcome to this convention we need their help
2842280 weve gone through a bruising primary season between these two excellent candidates and there are some people still healing from that i understand it
2842281 but in the end i believe that the hillary clinton supporters and hillary herself are definitely committed to obamas candidacy
2842282 i think the military conflict in georgia is the key factor in pushing up oil prices this morning so much has happened so quickly since we first heard of russias attack last week
2842283 there is also some degree of a technical rebound after oils sharp fall on friday
2842284 to remain in their homes and maintain contact with frances embassy
2842285 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
2842286 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
2842287 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games i do not think it is related to the olympics
2842288 to try to go ahead with the fight against poverty or it could just entrench the situation further
2842289 with gas prices passing the 4 per gallon mark consumers are altering their driving and spending habits at dramatic levels and even affluent consumers are looking for ways to make their dollars go further
2842290 while private label shows significant growth its important to remember that more than half of private label sales growth comes from only four product categories milk fresh eggs cheese and bread or baked goods which are greatly impacted by inflationary pricing resulting from higher livestock feed prices or higher raw ingredient prices
2842291 we did forecast heavy and thundery showers well in advance but not on the scale that it got to
2842292 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2842293 i think for full restoration of the constitution and for the survival of this nation and for democracy in this country it is very necessary that gen musharraf resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start
2842294 he was wondering if it was possible to devise a virtual love tree in which one can stake a claim to a partner or warn others of a bad experience they had
2842295 its not malicious in any way basically one signs up with a user name and uses the feature called slap a tag where he she can leave a little review and also detail their current status with that person basically they can say if he or she is taken or if and when they finished up
2842296 other people will have left reviews based on their experience any type of review can be left good or bad and just think of all the uses it could have how many false names are given out with mobile numbers in clubs and bars around the world every week how many people are broken hearted because they didnt know the person they were about to jump into bed with and like the site owner how many men and women are secretly seeing multiple partners
2842297 hes not like that anymore hes settled down with just the one
2842298 enable ireland recently became aware of concerns in relation to an employee and immediately undertook an investigation we can confirm that the employee is not currently on duty

2842300 petitioner did not demonstrate sincere remorse for the earlier actions that precipitated their licence surrender
2842301 you know how we do it were going to evaluate what we see based on performance
2842302 spencer made that putt a bomb it was a huge putt for him
2842303 for me to make it on top of him it takes all the wind from his sails to make that at that time you cant ask for anything more
2842304 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2842305 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2842306 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2842307 these singles guys get to play doubles at the grand slams but they dont get seeded as they are at the olympics
2842308 i had practice at 10 a m this morning and they had to turn the lights on because its so foggy you cant see across the court
2842309 you can see from the beginning of the day until the end how the dirt kind of piles up on the hard court all of a sudden youre getting ball marks as the day goes on
2842310 to determine if any of the regulations were not followed
2842311 i want to see it gone i want to see them compensate our neighbourhood for the damage theyve caused us and the fear theyve caused our children
2842312 they should have realized dont put something like that in a residential area youre going to kill somebody
2842313 my concern today is the safety of the torontonians who live in the vicinity and the safety of our emergency service workers and the workers at the propane facility
2842314 it was inevitable something like this was going to happen it was just a matter of time
2842315 excellent safety record and incidents like this are an extremely rare occurrence
2842316 hes playing well no doubt hes got a lot of talent his forehand is huge it will be interesting to see how he does
2842317 he certainly has the weapons it depends on how he builds on it
2842318 if i want to be in the top 10 i have to beat them highly ranked players on every surface and im beginning to do that
2842319 its a little bit early to be drawing conclusions but over the past six months we has seen an increase in the number of applications from irish people for employment positions in our restaurants for the first time in approximately 10 years
2842320 we believe that our advertising campaigns to celebrate the wide variety of cultures working in mcdonalds in ireland and the positive benefits this brings to our employees and to the company as a whole has played a large part in these figures
2842321 in july the new business employment and expectations indices set fresh lows while the total activity index recovered slightly all three sub components remained well into negative territory indicating substantial rates of contraction in each case

2842362 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2842363 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it

2842369 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice
2842370 there was a garnish i think and some hashbrowns and i can take you through minute by minute after that
2842371 the eggs were mixed with the hashbrowns so i dont know which one actually hit his mouth first ill film it next time

2842374 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2842375 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2842376 i think for full restoration of the constitution and for the survival of this nation and for democracy in this country it is very necessary that gen musharraf resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start

2842378 now even the small mom and pop operation can have access to top level services and systems

2842381 at valuecruncher we decided to put some numbers around the potential future performance of csco using our on line valuation tool our assumptions of revenues for the next three years are 43 5 billion in 2009 growing to 52 5 billion in 2011 a 10 compound annual growth rate we have projected ebitda margins to grow from 29 0 in 2009 to 30 0 in 2011

2842399 there are two reasons ciscos numbers are surprising the first is that its large router business primarily sells products to telecom and cable companies capital spending in those sectors has not been sharply increasing so cisco must be improving its market share or its margins

2842405 it didnt make any difference what you asked them to do
2842406 they just wouldnt say anything theyd just do it and do it perfectly
2842407 and i think they comforted us and said no maybe its a little scary but were going to go anyway
2842408 were most concerned about elizabeth because she experienced what happened and were just praying for all of them

2842428 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2842429 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2842430 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2842431 but compared with his attending the olympic games the profit is much larger than the loss
2842432 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2842433 china will be a better place if there is more freedom of religion
2842434 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2842435 president hu seemed to indicate that the door is opening on religious freedom in china and that in the future there will be more room for religious believers
2842436 it is good that the president can worship here but it is not likely that we will have more freedom or be able to register our churches
2842437 several house churches have been closed before the olympics the police say that we are threatening national security and demand that my husband gives up his faith
2842438 he needs to justify and defend his successful policy towards east asia
2842439 he has been more successful in the region than china
2842440 he did not waver in his decision to come and he emphasized that not going would have been an affront to the chinese people that has been very well received in china
2842441 it is an irony that like other presidents hes finding china a pretty nice place there are no hecklers and he can make his points and the u s can feel superior its a welcome diversion from washington
2842442 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2842449 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2842450 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2842463 whats that young lady im sorry to hear you are disappointed its not my fault that the drunken dreamboat you met last night gave you the wrong telephone number
2842464 it just keeps giving you a busy signal when you call what do you expect from some bum you met at a raunchy bar at 2 am that is not the proper hunting ground for you to find your mate while youre at it stop calling that number its the irs hotline you dont have those kinds of problems too do you sometimes life has more questions than answers you have to learn to go with the flow
2842465 yes young lady there are men who want to meet a nice girl

2842469 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2842470 this is an extraordinary swing and it underlines the disillusionment australians are seeing and feeling with the lack of leadership from the new federal labor government a government that promised so much
2842471 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2842472 and all weve got is one watch after another fuelwatch grocerywatch and who knows what the next watch exercise will be
2842473 he promised action and delivered nothing thats why australians are so disillusioned
2842474 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2842475 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2842476 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done
2842477 but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2842478 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them

2842480 vsu voluntary student unionism has had a devastating impact on campus life and culture but also on essential support services that student organisations provide to help students while theyre at uni
2842481 this is a dreadful and sorry tale and i agree with that
2842482 we committed before the election that we would not reintroduce compulsory student unionism
2842483 we said we would find a way of working with universities and student organisations to make sure that students could get services and that students could engage in proper advocacy
2842484 an extensive background in newspaper and magazine journalism and as co author of news improved how americas newspapers are learning to change
2842485 a culinary instructor at tante maries cooking school in san francisco and a consulting chef for san franciscos center for culinary development
2842486 when the chief kangaroo was the chair of the public accounts committee then they didnt mind going to the zoo
2842487 when they were in opposition they were able to use the committee procedure to investigate government wrongdoing now its similarly in the publics best interest for us to do the same
2842488 as industrial agriculture characterized by massive capital investment and the extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers is increasingly challenged the future looks increasingly bright for persons engaged in environmentally friendly agriculture including a new generation of organic producers public policy will have to be adjusted to recognize their needs and potential as well as those of the growing number of green collar workers who will inhabit rural canada

2842493 with platforms including iphone symbian microsoft and eventually android mobile applications and networks of the future will not be able to zero in on a single device or os
2842494 they will have to support multiple operating systems and various functionality and form factors since some handsets will have touch screens some will have keyboards some will have scanner devices et cetera
2842495 there will not be a single dominant device or os

2842506 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2842507 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2842508 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2842509 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2842510 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2842511 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2842512 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2842513 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2842514 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2842515 these results demonstrate the continued rise of the greens in australian politics
2842516 it also demonstrates the greens are a credible alternative to the two old parties as voters increasingly embrace the policies and energy of the greens
2842517 funding raised by a levy would go straight into the ambulance services
2842518 it is bad enough to have to contend with loud boorish or drunken behaviour in streets bars or railway trains

2842520 i am absolutely delighted we won it has been a team effort throughout
2842521 inflation has reached 4 5 per cent yet paramedics are being offered annual increases of 3 25 per cent basically theyre being offered a pay cut how can they accept that
2842522 hoped to see a considerable amount of progress in the next four weeks
2842523 certainly i would think in the next four to five weeks if there has been little progress i think were left with no choice but to go to the industrial relations commission and mount a case for putting industrial action to a ballot of our members
2842524 the ultimate action would be stop work action if it got to a serious point
2842525 you get excited about the offense and the way smith ran the ball and you get worried about the defense giving up two big runs like that
2842526 offensively we started fast and made some plays i didnt really like the way the defense started out
2842527 there was a bunch of misalignments and a couple of missed assignments
2842528 i give myself an ok i know i can get a lot better in some areas like blocking
2842529 the offensive line did a fantastic job run blocking all day
2842530 when you give michael deanthony and chip gregory those kind of holes theyre going to make runs
2842531 we set the tempo in the second half but weve got to set the tempo earlier than we did
2842532 we showed some fatigue and a lack of toughness at times and then we showed the ability to rush the passer at times
2842533 zola tried to cut in without being far enough ahead there was no question but that she was in the wrong
2842534 he was a loving brother he was a good son to my father and mother and he was a loving father to his son

2842540 it was quiet during the night but no one went to bed theres no tv were reading the news from our phones scary my friend a colleague has been wounded and there are the dead ones ive no reason to lie and those commenters who have doubts just dont know anything about me i am russian myself and thats why im writing about facts here so that you knew we are alive but scared i want peace and this is all
2842541 around midnight i heard some roaring ran up to the window and saw shaft of fire explosions at the port and heard a deafening noise i didnt even have the time to get scared i just knew that if a cistern with oil at the terminal gets hit therell be fire and an explosion so i grabbed the phone called tengo vika answered screaming samira the port is being bombed mama with alina and our niece were running aimlessly around the apartment the explosions continued and we ran downstairs
2842542 antes n o havia correspond ncia entre o enade e o conceito final emitido pelas comiss es de avalia o in loco essa lacuna que estamos preenchendo
2842543 its a known fact that august is our more prominent month for jellyfish stings and also the warmer the water the stronger the sting
2842544 first thing you want to do is when you get stung is remove the tentacles from the body or the skin and you do this with wet sand or with a wet towel then you spray the vinegar base solution that lifeguards carry
2842545 the first shock it gets you it feels like a bunch of needles digging in just like real shock you want to get out of the water for sure then about an hour afterwards it calms down just like a lot of bee stings all at once
2842546 and let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds
2842547 todays game was overall not a comfortable game from a personal standpoint
2842548 i knew that barring something like that happening for me i was probably going to go home and have a pretty rough night
2842549 now i can go home and look forward to tomorrow its a nice feeling
2842550 he comes into situations like this and hes just not making pitches
2842551 at first i thought it was going to stay fair for sure then i saw it had kind of had a little lean to it
2842552 i wasnt positive whether it would stay fair im glad it did
2842553 all the time i wait for this kind of moment
2842554 this guy had a no hitter going into the sixth inning without his best stuff
2842555 he ran his pitch count with those five walks but were so happy for this kid weve got a pitcher here hes got four pitches and he can throw them for strikes
2842556 i feel like we have a very good lineup from top to bottom and its a complete team effort
2842557 not at all hes fine his hitting is going to come around
2842558 to do it in a situation when we needed a hit and a run is just icing on the cake
2842559 i thought he kept the ball down changed speeds well it was encouraging to see
2842560 i was looking for the oxygen tank at third base
2842561 theyre a good team obviously it was a devastating series for us but weve got to rebound
2842562 every game is a playoff from now on weve dug ourselves a huge hole but weve got to come out fighting and play with a lot of urgency weve been in this situation before and were going to show what this team is made of
2842563 i never count that team out but it just shows how well were playing right now
2842564 it starts with the pitching and today we just found a way to score enough runs to win
2842565 its frustrating i hate it that i wasnt able to hold them down better than i did
2842566 they figure out a way to win and thats what good teams do
2842567 it was 100 the right move to make i mean on the road you have to play to win
2842568 i had a good jump the catcher made a perfect throw i stole the base and everyone knows that the umpire had great position on it he just simply missed it
2842569 i thought we had a pickoff play going with richie and there was a serious miscommunication there he was actually talking to alex and alex was probably standing right behind me at third base it screwed up the inning big time
2842570 i mean he could have given up and let the yankees get a few more runs but he stepped up huge and kept us in the game
2842571 to get him for me was like milwaukee getting cc sabathia
2842572 hes one of those guys you dont want to see because hes got a tremendous angle on his fastball and a good assortment of pitches i was kind of hoping wed get a little rain take him out play big but it didnt work out that way
2842573 i made some stupid pitches and when i did they made me pay for them uggla came up and swung at the first pitch it was supposed to be down and away and it was up
2842574 every now and then you get lucky and get a base hit
2842575 we have to win as many games as we can the way the division is its crucial for us to keep playing and keep plugging along
2842576 we had a chance to get to him and they got out of it with a double play
2842577 to win three out of four against their pitching staff is pretty good
2842578 theyve got an outstanding staff and getting three is big
2842579 i made some terrible pitches with guys in scoring position
2842580 that first inning went a long way toward getting us moving in the right direction
2842581 early runs and brandon webb on the mound usually ends up being all good in the end
2842582 you know how we do it were going to evaluate what we see based on performance
2842583 it is impossible to tell whether a burden on interstate commerce is excessive without understanding the magnitude of both burdens and benefits exact figures are not essential no more than estimates may be possible and the evidence need not be in the record if it is subject to judicial notice but it takes more than lawyers talk to condemn a statute
2842584 it would be awfully hard to take judicial notice that in person verification with photo id has no effect on wine fraud and therefore flunks the interstate commerce clause
2842585 given the state of this record and the state of the empirical literature we know very little
2842586 prime minister margaret thatcher and her husband dennis narrowly escaped injury
2842587 a quest for a reliable strategic partner with america being the preferred choice
2842588 their grand ambition is to undo the post cold war settlement and to re establish russia as a dominant power in eurasia
2842589 anything we can do to weaken the u s is good for russia
2842590 if sites were shops egullet would be selfridges a massive department store trying to cater to all tastes sometimes though i want a boutique operation top of these is dos hermanos the blog of the two half bengali half welsh majumdar brothers who eat out more than is strictly necessary and write very well about it
2842591 simon m and his bro have got to be the rock gods of the uk food blog
2842592 punchily written and stylishly designed recording two food lovers experiences
2842593 two guys who write reviews about mostly london restaurants they are a bit up their own arses but an interesting read anyways
2842594 i think that the imbecil that wrote this 1st don t understand anything about food
2842595 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
2842596 as the palestinian poet mahmoud darwish has observed palestine is a metaphor for the loss of eden for the sorrows of dispossession and exile for the declining power of the arab world in its dealings with the west
2842597 duley privately approached authorities and ivinss lawyers when a session with ivins led her to believe that he posed a plausible and specific threat to his coworkers
2842598 and the driver asks me what my job is i tell him im a writer
2842599 public opinion now is very bad if i tell him im an mp i worry hell get angry or start accusing me of something
2842600 it was a very impulsive reaction people felt the commission had gone beyond what was allowed by law
2842601 the kpk was created by parliament its bill was passed by parliament its members were elected by parliament and now theyre scared of it
2842602 most people are very alert now when using the phone
2842603 we have to be careful were frightened to discuss even legitimate issues about money most people would rather talk about those things in person than on the phone in case its misconstrued by the kpk
2842604 bribery is still rampant the kpk has just scared the mediocre corruptors and made the slick ones slicker
2842605 this is the start of the process of making decisions on how each company proposes to provide value for money long term high quality water services to its customers
2842606 we will now examine draft business plans in detail checking the proposed level of service and investment
2842607 we will make sure each plan includes everything we expect takes account of concerns expressed by customers and does so as efficiently as possible
2842608 thames customers have enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years but we now need to make essential investment to secure their services for the future
2842609 this is particularly true for london where the water and sewerage infrastructure is ageing
2842610 there will be an inevitable impact on bills but even so we will be able to keep them below the industry average
2842611 i was comfortable with my game in winning the open this week i havent been as confident and comfortable
2842612 here i hit some of the wildest golf shots ever hit on a golf course on friday but i knew i had the ability to win if i got a chance in the end it was a lot of sheer willpower that won it
2842613 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2842614 you have to get focused and give it a go
2842615 if a couple of things had gone differently we would have been talking differently
2842616 the good thing about it is i felt good out there i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2842617 if there is a cold snap coming patients can get their shopping in beforehand or contact their doctors and get their prescription early so they are not exposed to the low temperatures
2842618 i found this system to be very useful in planning and ordering of medication and adjusting lifestyle to take account of the weather conditions
2842619 being aware of detrimental weather conditions enables people to plan ahead and avoid situations that could aggravate their condition
2842620 the patients love it we give them a pack developed with healthcare professionals which gives them quite a lot of information about what their condition is about and what they can do about it
2842621 we remind them about the importance of keeping warm the temperature to keep their room at exercising trying to avoid the low temperatures and seeking medical advice at an early stage
2842622 with a small adjustment to their lives in the run up to the cold weather they can significantly reduce the likelihood of their getting poorly
2842623 it helps the patients meaning they do not spend time going in and out of hospital
2842624 overall it has been fairly successful and patients are hoping it will keep going
2842625 the patients last year were contacted two or three times
2842626 this has helped the practice as well as the patients the patients are aware there is a three week period after the cold snap when they are at most risk and are more vigilant
2842627 we are more vigilant too and we know we may expect more patients
2842628 we are thinking of starting a register of weather and ailments because a lot of it so far has been anecdotal and in the distant past was perhaps dismissed by some parts of the medical profession
2842629 we are looking at asthma mental health cardiovascular disease strokes and angina which are all affected by the weather
2842630 if you are at risk of having a heart attack is there something that can be done following an alert from the met office to stop you having one thats an important question
2842631 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2842632 this audit shows that the exceptional cases process is in chaos and patients are suffering
2842633 in the last 20 months 5 000 cancer patients have been forced to plead for their lives there has to be a better way
2842634 we urgently need some standardisation and transparency in the decision making process
2842635 we have heard from patients that one of their major concerns is the perceived postcode lottery in access to drugs that there are too many variations around who gets access to prescribed drugs and that these variations are a lottery depending on where you live
2842636 the draft nhs constitution will address this by making it explicit that patients have the right to nice approved drugs if clinically appropriate
2842637 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2842638 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2842639 risk be damned i want my oil my house my risky financial instruments and my government bailout when they fail
2842640 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2842641 it was disappointing but we have to forget it its history
2842642 we now just have to give full effort in the spl and make sure we win it
2842643 we won and we are happy we start the league with three points and that is good for us
2842644 it was the opening game and we were a little bit nervous thats normal but we got the three points and we need to keep this effort going
2842645 it is helping me now but i dont know if it will help me in three or four months but i hope to play in every single game
2842646 there are a lot of good strikers in the team but its the managers choice
2842647 its a challenge for every striker and player to work hard in every training session i think kris and i did not bad
2842648 possibly missing the penalty turned the game but big higdon is a wonderful guy and he was brave enough to take it
2842649 i would have liked to have seen him put the laces through it but it wasnt to be he took one over in holland and slotted it away superbly
2842650 you can nominate penalty takers but the guys usually decide within the team and say give me that ball
2842651 aku ingin amerika tahu bahwa aku sangat siap untuk memimpin
2842652 kami mengambil tindakan tegas melawan pornografi anak seiring dengan meningkatnya kesadaran masyarakat tentang isu ini dan begitu cepatnya penggandaan serta penyebaran pornografi di internet
2842653 we will listen to vieras demands and we expect to reach an agreement and sign the deal
2842654 viera has a good record and knows our players he is qualified to lead our team
2842655 this invasion of georgia by russia is a very sad commentary on eight years of self delusion in the white house regarding putin and his regime
2842656 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
2842657 as of us last talking together he is no longer employed
2842658 i love them i would love to see ozzy and ac dc play together
2842659 not just any song but a special collaboration with annlouice loegdlund the astonishing vocalist of our swedish friends of diablo swing orchestra
2842660 we are sad to say that the agreed on advance fee for the show never showed up and in agreement with how our agent works to provide the best service and security to us as a band the show was pulled
2842661 we really think it sucks big hairy balls but we have played way too many shows in the past where we or our agent have had to squeeze the agreed on fee from the promotor after huge hassles and sometimes paying money from our own pocket and in the end it just fucks with everyone from our fans us as people and those who work with us
2842662 we hope there will be other opportunities in the future to make it possible for us to come and play under better circumstances
2842663 he has insisted on making sure each motorcycle is as comfortable as it is unique
2842664 it just went from a dream just like a song does that comes to fruition
2842665 obviously with a 78 point lead now i think its pretty healthy but anything can happen
2842666 helio could quite easily have gained on us and made it more of a fight
2842667 with sonoma and chicago and belle isle tracks that those guys are very good at as well we are going to make sure we dont lose too many points but it would be nice to gain a couple on helio in sonoma and maybe we only need 82 points or something to have it sewn up heading to chicagoland speedway on sept 7 that would be nice but all reality i think well be racing almost till the last race
2842668 when i was going into turn 3 i thought i got it like im finally going to win this race or a race
2842669 and all of a sudden im coming out of turn 4 and the car just coughed my reaction at that time it was like no but i need to still finish the race i didnt want the car to stop right away i didnt know how many cars were behind dixon and marco andretti i just wanted to finish the race as high as i could
2842670 just got back from the two shows we did with the swedish death metal supergroup
2842671 our dress code blood infested mud caked worn torn shitty old t shirts black pants and some blood all over the usual stuff
2842672 it was great times overall i thought id be miserable being sick and being so busy with
2842673 so well go under the surface again now but do check out the album once its out its cool as hell
2842674 today we finished mixing and mastering our ninth studio album of original material death magnetic which hits the streets worldwide on friday september 12 plus youll be able to download every song from the album for guitar hero iii on the same day produced by rick rubin and recorded at sound city studios shangri la studios and our very own hq the first track and video the day that never comes will hit the airwaves later this month
2842675 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2842676 you have to get focused and give it a go
2842677 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2842678 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2842679 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
2842680 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
2842681 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
2842682 i give him so much credit for his preparation not knowing when hes going to get an opportunity
2842683 he keeps himself ready and he has a great attitude hes frustrated that he doesnt play more but he doesnt show it its just awesome what he has done so impressive
2842684 i was just trying to have a good at bat not swing at everything
2842685 it helped just to see some pitches those first two at bats looking at some pitches really helped
2842686 ive just waited for my moment every time im in the lineup i just want to contribute and feel part of the team with a game like today it feels great just helping
2842687 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2842688 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2842689 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2842690 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2842691 if there is a cold snap coming patients can get their shopping in beforehand or contact their doctors and get their prescription early so they are not exposed to the low temperatures
2842692 i found this system to be very useful in planning and ordering of medication and adjusting lifestyle to take account of the weather conditions
2842693 being aware of detrimental weather conditions enables people to plan ahead and avoid situations that could aggravate their condition

2842699 the good thing about it is i felt good out there i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2842700 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2842701 this is the start of the process of making decisions on how each company proposes to provide value for money long term high quality water services to its customers

2842703 we will make sure each plan includes everything we expect takes account of concerns expressed by customers and does so as efficiently as possible
2842704 thames customers have enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years but we now need to make essential investment to secure their services for the future
2842705 this is particularly true for london where the water and sewerage infrastructure is ageing
2842706 there will be an inevitable impact on bills but even so we will be able to keep them below the industry average

2842736 the early numbers suggest that all of this is fueling more interest
2842737 it encourages viewers and provides them with information there will be no dilution or fragmentation of the national audience
2842738 the industry saw a good bit of consolidation over the last couple of years
2842739 its best to say that were always looking for opportunities
2842740 we really believe that the consolidation of this industry can create a lot of value for stakeholders

2842745 do way more than we could ever dream to do on our own
2842746 if regulators let this alliance through in any way theyre permitting less competition
2842747 i think weve proved our value and are proving it even more now
2842748 the only thing thats guaranteed is that the future is very complicated
2842749 a big win for evo is a worst case scenario because he will start pushing his constitution hard and he wont feel the need to negotiate
2842750 we support evo because he represents our class of people

2842771 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay

2842800 as of us last talking together he is no longer employed
2842801 a deal has value above and beyond the money saved theres a psychological effect
2842802 but you cant eat it all in a couple of days before it starts wilting
2842803 its just crazy the way everything has kind of come along this year but we were fortunate its come along on us
2842804 the good lord is praying that were able to keep our car up front every week weve just been fortunate to run as well as we have at places and yet weve struggled at a couple others weve got some work to do i heard earlier today that the 48 jimmie johnson has been testing like 18 times this year and stuff and weve tested a couple places but nothing like that so were looking forward to the next couple weeks weve got some tests lined up and were going to try to learn something and keep our mojo going and keep it going through and into the chase
2842805 i mean were just out here to race our race and concentrate on making our car the fastest in practice and fastest in qualifying as best we can do and make it handle for happy hour and then go out there and try to race it and race with the rest of these guys
2842806 hes been strong since probably the sixth or seventh race of the year it took him a little bit longer to get going the 99 car edwards has been strong hes probably been the best car season long at being able to run up front and capitalize on the big tracks and the big ovals and the flat tracks too so theyve got something figured out youve just got to keep going and those statements will be made but you cant concentrate on that youve got to concentrate on your effort

2842811 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd mr turnbull told reporters in sydney today
2842812 this is an extraordinary swing and it underlines the disillusionment australians are seeing and feeling with the lack of leadership from the new federal labor government a government that promised so much
2842813 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2842814 and all weve got is one watch after another fuelwatch grocerywatch and who knows what the next watch exercise will be
2842815 he promised action and delivered nothing thats why australians are so disillusioned
2842816 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia ms gillard told abc radio today
2842817 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2842818 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done
2842819 but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2842820 fair bit of volatility because the territorys 25 electorates were so small
2842821 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them melbourne airport
2842822 i moved around on foot bicycle automobile tricycle what an odyssey
2842823 one of the most indefensible things the bush administration has done in the last few years
2842824 todays game was overall not a comfortable game from a personal standpoint
2842825 i knew that barring something like that happening for me i was probably going to go home and have a pretty rough night
2842826 now i can go home and look forward to tomorrow its a nice feeling
2842827 he comes into situations like this and hes just not making pitches
2842828 at first i thought it was going to stay fair for sure then i saw it had kind of had a little lean to it
2842829 i wasnt positive whether it would stay fair im glad it did
2842830 all the time i wait for this kind of moment
2842831 he ran his pitch count with those five walks but were so happy for this kid weve got a pitcher here hes got four pitches and he can throw them for strikes
2842832 ive said it before there were times i didnt know if i was going to be playing anymore i honestly didnt know
2842833 there were some scary times too those are all behind me now hopefully i came out of it feeling good and im just really really happy now
2842834 to be able to get back to the big leagues its special
2842835 its not about him playing right field and getting a hit today its just the matter of him getting back out getting back in the fray and i think thats going to in the long haul benefit him in a lot of different ways
2842836 you cant really look at what we dont have you have to look at what we do have and the guys that we do have can produce
2842837 i dont know why but ill say nothing right now
2842838 theyre a good team obviously it was a devastating series for us but weve got to rebound
2842839 every game is a playoff from now on weve dug ourselves a huge hole but weve got to come out fighting and play with a lot of urgency weve been in this situation before and were going to show what this team is made of
2842840 i never count that team out but it just shows how well were playing right now
2842841 it starts with the pitching and today we just found a way to score enough runs to win
2842842 its frustrating i hate it that i wasnt able to hold them down better than i did
2842843 they figure out a way to win and thats what good teams do
2842844 it was 100 percent the right move to make i mean on the road you have to play to win
2842845 i had a good jump the catcher made a perfect throw i stole the base and everyone knows that the umpire had great position on it he just simply missed it
2842846 i thought we had a pickoff play going with richie and there was a serious miscommunication there he was actually talking to alex and alex was probably standing right behind me at third base it screwed up the inning big time
2842847 i mean he could have given up and let the yankees get a few more runs but he stepped up huge and kept us in the game
2842848 e cosa ha fatto quel governo e perch noi stiamo facendo peggio non assolutamente vero ho i dati alle mani
2842849 the last thing i wanted to do was walk that guy
2842850 it was the perfect time for us because of our situation where were at
2842851 we really need to win thank god everything came through my way
2842852 guy throwing hard threw me a good pitch it sunk
2842853 tough to swallow whenever you go out there and you have a game plan and execute it and it still doesnt work out
2842854 the rock afire explosion videos went viral as they say and all hell broke loose
2842855 i decided to make an investment in the whole youtube phenomenon
2842856 developed by fechter puts internet users in the producers chair as they pay to get new songs produced
2842857 the company didnt want to license characters from me anymore they wanted to own my characters
2842858 but i believed i had a future with the rock afire explosion beyond what they wanted to do with it
2842859 nowadays it would cost several hundred thousand dollars to build a set
2842860 i sold them to fans for next to nothing to put them into the hands of people who loved them
2842861 my dream as far back as i can remember was to own a rock afire explosion stage show
2842862 our label sent me an e mail and said have you guys seen that rock afire website
2842863 its a story of two things the story of how rock afire came to be and how it came to disappear its sort of a tragic story there
2842864 but its also the story of chris thrash who single handedly brought it back into the public arena by putting shows on youtube
2842865 the question now is whether its a nostalgic flash in the pan or is there something there i say lets see if we can create quality content that will give us a new life
2842866 i knew from the very beginning if we could hang on long enough some day the rock afire explosion would live on again
2842867 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
2842868 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2842869 you have to get focused and give it a go
2842870 the first morning we got it he shared his cereal with it
2842871 i think at first i tried to talk her out of it but i am willing to try anything to help might make it easier
2842872 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2842873 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2842874 well maybe i will be seeing you sooner than i thought and thats o k with me
2842875 im always looking to make something happen they have such a great bullpen you cant sit around and wait for things happen i was safe bill expletive up
2842876 i believe he was safe so i dont have a problem alex is a very smart base runner he knows exactly what hes doing he just didnt run recklessly he studied the pitcher i turned him loose
2842877 at the moment im using grammar that is more useful than the grammar you are using
2842878 how the hell am i going to do this without starving
2842879 games are an incredible language and system they should be everywhere
2842880 why are we making games only for the bound pages for a computer screen or console why arent we doing that to help people navigate and understand the world around us
2842881 well remember this summer not as the summer from hell but of disappointment
2842882 people are feeling that it doesnt matter if they save money on air conditioning or that theyre healthier because theres no smog its just too wet and stormy
2842883 whats remarkable about this is the contrast with last year which was one of our worst droughts
2842884 people will remember that we had one of the driest summers ever and now the wettest summer back to back
2842885 its frustrating because its not just rain morning noon and night we get teased with sunshine and then drenched with rain
2842886 its a huge disappointment it wouldnt be as frustrating if the weather could make up its mind on what it wants to give you its a real challenge to plan when you have a summer with all kinds of weather on same day
2842887 the big smoke has been replaced by the big wet
2842888 everyone thinks our forecasts are as big of a washout as the weather but were saying august and september are going to be drier than normal eventually it has to give up nature must be getting worn out
2842889 but atleast sexon plays a good 1b betemit looks drunk out there
2842890 can anyone out there convince me that this team cannot only make the playoffs but win a pennant
2842891 cashman needs to go and his replacement has a challenging job of overhauling some of these long term contracts i need some convincing that this can effectively done cashman to philly
2842892 thats waht you get for not having an experienced first baseman
2842893 who cares what hank thinks opening his big mouth doesnt do anything but embarrass the franchise
2842894 can anyone out there convince me that this team cannot only make the playoffs but win a pennant
2842895 using a combination of gifted mediums scientific equipment and the all important sceptic we aim to
2842896 we gave gary the right number of minutes today that was perfect for him
2842897 when you talk in terms of character and think that nevilles been out for that length of time and come back like that its remarkable hes a remarkable man the desire and determination and quality of his game of course i dont think gary will play all the time this season he wants to test himself playing a lot of games but if we get 30 or 35 games from him in his first season back well be delighted
2842898 it will be a challenge to win my place back absolutely
2842899 the competition for places throughout the team is fantastic as there are probably two or three players who can play in each position
2842900 my challenges this season are to stay fit and to make my way into the team again
2842901 it was fantastic just to get a competitive game under my belt and just to be out there and a part of it again was great i didnt feel anything injury wise today touch wood i just need more games now to get my sharpness back i just want to make a contribution this season when youre not playing you feel like youre not helping your team mates i hope this season i can contribute in some way
2842902 i think hell be glad just to be in our squad
2842903 i suppose he could be involved in a friendly there wouldnt be a problem with that though id prefer him to play with us for a few more weeks before getting back into international football
2842904 the wolves will be at the door already because of what happened last season
2842905 i fully understand that im not hiding from that if id have taken the job in the summer and put together the team weve got today people would be saying it will take time ive been in the championship for three years as a manager and won two promotions the other time we finished seventh so i think my record stands up to scrutiny but for every player and every manager youre only as good as your last game so as far as thats concerned were not very good
2842906 we may have played derby off the pitch at times
2842907 to win the tournament is a tough ask from here
2842908 which is obviously the position that i wanted to be in
2842909 its all about experience and getting into position to see what it feels like
2842910 but one bad shot at the wrong time can scare you they are all young and they have to come back better prepared majors test every nerve ending in your body
2842911 they have to get rid of that voice of doubt in their minds you need the self confidence and the bottle and you have to hit the millions of balls you have to hit to think you deserve success whether this group actually has it or not remains to be seen they certainly have talent and they are getting into position now it is down to their determination to succeed
2842912 everyone tiger excluded fails a number of times before they succeed in majors
2842913 look at phil mickelson or tom watson who was once looked upon as a choker too many people are unwilling to give players time to develop in majors
2842914 aimed at protecting those processes of development and change that are slow enough to have a past resistance derives its strength from the slow time of human life including the continual grief of repressed cultural or personal identity and the protracted agonies of living under oppression each step forward should be so fully comprehended and massively parallel that it endures it is the only possible approach for those of us who are devoted to literature works of art help change to ripen measuring its costs carefully and calling it by old names
2842915 philomela held her cut tongue in her hand like a ticket although her past was history her silence strengthened her gave her wings
2842916 humans from any other period and region are always in some sense our contemporaries
2842917 the writing of history must implicitly assume a plurality of times existing together a disjuncture of the present with itself
2842918 practice a historicism that brings the past and the present premodern and postmodern alongside each other in a rich heterogeneity that stresses a temporality and spatiality that is coincidental affective and performative rather than stabilizingly teleological segmented or hierarchized
2842919 is the possibility of being untimely of placing ourselves outside the constraints the limitations and blinkers of the present this is precisely what it means to write for a future that the present cannot recognize to develop to cultivate the untimely the out of place and the out of step this access to the out of step can come only from the past and a certain uncomfortableness a dis ease in the present
2842920 must stress not difference the past as past or sameness the past as present but temporal interlacement the impossibility of choosing alterity or continuity the past that opens up the present to possible futures
2842921 is not the recovery of the truth of bodies or lives in the past it is the engendering of new kinds of bodies and new kinds of lives history is in part an index of our present preoccupations but perhaps more interesting the past is as rich as our futures allow
2842922 what we make of events as we use language in the present how we continuously create an ethos of the way in which events are understood
2842923 against all odds project of recomposing some small portion of the habitus
2842924 time is the question of the subject seized by his or her other in a present that is the ongoing surprise of a birth and a death
2842925 like the voice of the lorenz hart lyric a nearness that is nearer than the wind is to the willow
2842926 the metonymic participative touch or look or reading brings more fully into being the bodies texts and buildings it brushes against
2842927 a gift of the past to the presented affected with futurity
2842928 inscribed with the vouloir dire of a people that has been silenced of the dead others
2842929 the sensory experience of being made an outsider which these unfortunate men lived
2842930 introduces a temporal multiplicity an expanded now in which past touches present making a physical impression
2842931 i n a genealogical framework that seeks to overcome the denial of the body in traditional historicism we could attempt an analysis of the experience of such times
2842932 roland barthes the pleasure of the text stayed near like a fellow passenger on the train
2842933 hold is not just to behold it is to be held even to be held in suspense
2842934 the primary intensities which had motivated me might not pass into the order of reason
2842935 to expand our apprehension and experience of bodies in time their pleasures their agonies their limits their potentials
2842936 behind the dirty jalousie window slats the aids patients play cards
2842937 down here the lonely claim my voice and make it strong
2842938 peu de gens devineront combien il a fallu tre triste pour ressusciter carthage

2842973 all of a sudden i had direct loans of this and that much
2842974 making the change from ffelp to direct lending was a hot issue
2842975 when congress cut the lenders bottom line by reducing their federal subsidies the differences between the ffelp loan and direct loan programs for the stafford loans have pretty much disappeared
2842976 the rate reductions previously offered by many ffelp lenders are now few and far between as profit margins have been reduced for these ffelp lenders that remain in the federal loan business
2842977 this year due to everything thats been happening in the market direct loans are definitely on the rise
2842978 lenders offering loans backed by taxpayer dollars shouldnt be able to discriminate against certain schools or students
2842979 mccain believes students should be able to choose and have options for lenders operating in an efficient appropriately regulated marketplace
2842980 the safest thing not knowing the future is direct lending
2842981 we continue to reinforce the importance of applying for your loans earlier rather than later especially this year
2842982 a lot of money energy and good will was violated and wasted through a program that was doomed to fail
2842983 i wish we could expedite the roll out of the blue carts not only in our ward but throughout the city
2842984 i think we need to move forward as quickly as we can to have a true seems like a long time for the execution of the blue cart program in chicago according to jeremy obrien director of applied research at the solid waste association of north america but residents must consider how expensive it is to implement a single stream recycling system in which the recyclables are completely separate from the waste he said the blue bag program did not require citizens to cull recyclables from their garbage depending on city workers to separate in when you have a city the size of chicago
2842985 its difficult to do all at once from a financial standpoint
2842986 if the education isnt clear if the terms arent laid out overall parties are calling the blue cart system a victory for chicago
2842987 when you make things easier for people then theyll do it
2842988 you cannot call yourself a green city if you dont have a recycling system that is so fundamental
2842989 had we been doing a separation program in chicago for a long time we might be at a point where we could have bins downtown because its the same system people have in people to see that these materials have value
2842990 concepci n ha sido un rally espectacular hemos logrado un victoria de vital importancia en nuestras aspiraciones para lograr el tricampeonato los caminos de esta etapa eran muy parecidos a los del s bado y el hyundai rindi a la perfecci n a pesar del barro y la lluvia
2842991 con este nuevo triunfo alargaremos a m s de 15 puntos la ventaja que tenemos con pozzo lo cu l nos deja con mucha confianza para las siguientes competencias ya que sabemos que estamos haciendo bien las cosas
2842992 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2842993 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2842994 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2842995 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2842996 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2842997 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2842998 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2842999 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2843000 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2843001 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2843002 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2843003 you have to get focused and give it a go
2843004 if we can stop the signal for the proliferation of uncontrolled growth of the cells then we can stop the leukaemia in its tracks
2843005 if scientists found a cure or something that could help not to have his puffer every day that would be great
2843006 to try to go ahead with the fight against poverty or it could just entrench the situation further
2843007 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2843008 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2843009 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2843010 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2843011 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2843012 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2843013 it shows people are getting proficient at analysing apple software
2843014 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2843022 his life was all about him blah blah blah he was a rebel i dont need to know anything else i dont need to know the minutia everything you need to know is right there
2843023 obviously there are a number of factors that we have to consider at the time of making a rate move
2843024 i havent seen anything like this in my whole life
2843025 we had nothing to eat we just had a bit of bread a bit of water
2843026 we have nothing to feed them we give the little bread we have to the elderly they need it most

2843029 the passing of our great poet mahmoud darwish the lover of palestine the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project and the brilliant national leader will leave a great gap in our political cultural and national lives
2843030 words cannot describe the depth of sadness in our hearts mahmoud may god help us for your loss
2843031 h e translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions apart from being the poet of the palestinian wound which is hurting all arabs and all honest people in the world he is a master poet
2843032 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2843033 you have to get focused and give it a go
2843034 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2843035 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2843036 hes one of the easiest guys ive ever known to get along with
2843037 he likes to interact with the entire world he has the door open to everyone
2843038 everybody around him is always laughing time goes by quickly when youre around him
2843039 its always nice when someone from your country joins you you feel freer
2843040 you can speak more spanish be a little more social
2843041 the national i think his post fight celebration was a bit too much good win for him although heres the video of georges st pierre vs jon fitch fight at ufc 87

2843047 i just got barack rolld wonder how big this gets
2843048 i havent watched the simpsons in a while but i
2843049 i could kick your butt with one hand tied behind my back so meet me backstage
2843050 what a sweet thing to do theres still love out there girls
2843051 do we have two women in a swim final today i seem to remember two qualifying in second and fourth yesterday or are they just through to the semis
2843052 i have got the strangest sleeping routine now that the olympics have started staying awake at work will be impossible for the next 2 weeks
2843053 shes the ultimate competitior she has this great smile but theres a calculated brain behind that smile
2843054 thats the first time that a walk off hit ever happened to me
2843055 thats just a great feeling all the guys are on top of you jumping on you and punching you thats the only time i think when you get punched it doesnt hurt this is definitely a confidence booster especially having not played that much
2843056 hes a power hitter so i just tried to make them pay and it worked out
2843057 i knew he was at least going to going to get up there and battle i think he might have half expected i was going to pinch hit for him
2843058 the easiest way to describe that game was we gave it away
2843059 early in the game late in the game it was probably as bad a defense as you can play the first two runs they got was ridiculous a chopper back to the mound and were not covering first base
2843060 we missed opportunities to score but still if we catch the ball and get the outs were supposed to get thats a w not a loss
2843061 you can slice it and dice it and word it anyway you want but it cost us the game you know we got closer joe nathan coming in right there and you know how well hes done this year so ill take that one for the team for sure it stinks but thats the way it is
2843062 i went to throw to second and you know i wasnt 100 percent sure that we had him there and then i go to first and really i probably should have just ran all the way
2843063 the twins pitch well scratch out runs and play good defense
2843064 thats how they win games today they made a few errors and the wild pitch and luckily we were able to do something with it when they made those mistakes
2843065 the national i think his post fight celebration was a bit too much good win for him although heres the video of georges st pierre vs jon fitch fight at ufc 87
2843066 i wanted a milk shake from steak and shake so

2843077 we need to be lifting retention to year twelve or equivalent
2843078 none of this is going to be easy but we need to make sure that young people are staying in education and coming out with skills
2843079 the essence of league tables is you take one little thing and whack it in a list and say thats all you need to know about your local school
2843080 what we want to know is very comprehensive information about who is in each school because that would tell you something about educational need
2843081 we are going to give to all of our disabled veterans who are up to 50 percent disabled according to the doctors the opportunity to have a 100 percent exemption on their local property taxes
2843082 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2843083 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2843084 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2843085 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2843086 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2843087 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2843088 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2843089 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2843090 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2843091 country fans are more loyal than fans of other genres

2843116 im not going to deny that some states have looked at this as a revenue generating activity
2843117 but theres a vast majority of states that want to return the money to rightful owners
2843118 helped with what at the time was a budget problem
2843119 it looks like it could hit 3 million if the trend continues
2843120 for years the favorite setting for the big dance number has been a cabaret with its atmosphere of forbidden liquor and sexual permissiveness with its mixed audience of privileged indians industrialists playboys princes and its foreign decadence
2843121 with the price of heating oil well have fires every night
2843122 youd think in a state like this that you could get wood
2843123 a lot of people think electric motorcycles are slow and boring
2843124 its unbelievable how much power you can get into these electric motors
2843125 experienced riders are the ones who are most blown away
2843126 the goal is to take this electric drivetrain into different segments of the motorcycle business
2843127 you can really muscle it around you dont feel like it has control over you you always have control over it
2843128 you can ride around your neighborhood ride in the bike lanes
2843129 i couldnt help but reach this conclusion they love their work the careers they have chosen the skills they have learned the products they make and the services they provide but they are beginning to hate their jobs
2843130 its about conceptualizing ideas kind of like a think tank
2843131 it may be meant to scare away clients we dont want to work with
2843132 they took a limited production military weapon and made it fun without losing all of its naughtiness in the process
2843133 when you turn your car on does it return the favor
2843134 its by far the best of company names that dont involve names of real people
2843135 a message like businessweek s front cover is their advertisement
2843136 to us they have a very interesting design department that happens to be inside an ad agency
2843137 lance and gary have a passion for the car business
2843138 what makes modernista different is that they focus on understanding the real business issues
2843139 dealers started to see import oriented buyers shopping in the cadillac showroom
2843140 44 percent indicated addressing global warming should necessarily cause them personal financial hardship
2843141 44 percent would be willing to face any financial hardship in the name of a solution
2843142 the evidence is pretty convincing that the models give a good simulation of climate

2843144 then shall they be gods because they have no end therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting because they continue then shall they be above all because all things are subject unto them then shall they be gods because they have all power and the angels are subject unto them

2843148 brad johnson showed everyone again what hes not just like pre season last year if we want to look at receivers its nonsense to play him at all
2843149 if comedy is the new rock and roll it certainly isnt perceived as a healthy profession
2843150 whether its true or not comedians are seen as people who stay up late travel around the country stopping to eat at service stations and we thought we should use comedy to promote more positive health messages
2843151 they are real health checks by real nurses to encourage people to think a bit more about their health
2843152 i think the main thing will be encouraging healthy eating and lifestyle changes but a lot of younger comedians are already taking that message on board
2843153 for some reason his his bag fell off his shoulder
2843154 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2843155 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2843156 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2843157 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2843158 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2843159 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2843160 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2843161 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2843162 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
2843163 isaac hayes was a wonderful human begin and his spirit will live long in the form of his music
2843164 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage

2843173 its not on tape which for me is like nirvana
2843174 i think all of our trees are paying for whats been happening over the last few years
2843175 a lot of kids are going to have to rely on the regular routes and compete with adults for seats
2843176 the evidence right now on the link between brain tumors and cell phone usage is weak at best
2843177 theres never been anything thats proven in my opinion to show theres an association but things were hearing are noteworthy enough that make it reasonable for us to take preventative measures
2843178 basically they still do the activities but they decide that its worthwhile to enjoy the activity as opposed to worrying about the risk
2843179 earthgrazers are long slow and colorful they are among the most beautiful of meteors
2843180 i think this is very important for all kids its good for their self esteem
2843181 so many people have done good things for me this is a good way to give back
2843182 we felt the need to kind of give folks a little relief with the economic situation
2843183 you look good you feel good and you perform better

2843188 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2843189 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armour and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2843190 we do not plan to escalate the conflict in this region
2843191 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2843192 regime change is an american expression we do not use such an expression
2843193 but sometimes there are occasions and we know from history that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle
2843194 we cant tell her it will scare her too much
2843195 the only thing i know is the loud bang and after that i did not know anything until later on when i wake up

2843198 they said today hes getting better but theyll need to monitor him a few more days until hes stable
2843199 i know theres a lot of people who need more help who have lost a loved one
2843200 i wish i could have been there for my mom at the time when she needed me most
2843201 i should have been there to help her i could have helped her somehow
2843202 we were taught to be humble down to earth and quiet
2843203 we dont like to depend on people for a lot of things if we can do it ourselves we will
2843204 im not even family and this has affected me so much
2843205 they were not family to me but they are family
2843206 no one thought the people on this bus would die

2843223 the mtv africa music awards will create an unprecedented global platform for african musicians to shine and to spread the word about africas extraordinary music talent
2843224 obviously there are a number of factors that we have to consider at the time of making a rate move
2843225 they are making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
2843226 the chances of having low tire pressure is 33 3 or 1 in 3 cars on the road
2843227 they are making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent
2843228 we would only do it for the local ownership group
2843229 if we work together im positive we can work through these things
2843230 were certainly not going to be pressured into a decision based on what the teamsters have done
2843231 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2843232 i couldnt believe that i actually felt better not fantastic but better
2843233 and i wanted to know why and i wanted to help others
2843234 someone said to me why are you sitting through all this testimony and i said i dont want to be surprised by anything in traumatic grief thats when your stomach does a flip when you get an intense headache and when you want to go to bed for three days
2843235 well there is no law that says i have to but thats my son aaron whos going to stand for him
2843236 ive gone back and forth in my mind on the death penalty

2843239 inte nnu vi r inte klara men vi forts tter i morgon
2843240 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2843241 especially when youre down 3 0 before you take the field
2843242 we really needed to win especially this game against these guys
2843243 its a big thing losing jose but weve got to step up
2843244 when weve lost a tough game this game this season when weve really needed to come back it seems like weve been able to win a ballgame
2843245 that stops the bleeding and it also gives you a chance to build a little momentum
2843246 for the first time in my life i dont really get nervous about things but before the game i couldnt eat that much
2843247 i dont know if i was just excited or what but it was fun and it was a happy day for me and i think a lot of people my family and friends and everyone
2843248 there were times when i didnt know if i was going to be playing anymore i honestly didnt know there were some scary times too and all of that is behind me hopefully and things look good i came out of it feeling good im just really really happy now
2843249 anytime somebody can come back after contemplating retirement because of something you cant control just getting back is awesome its a little emotional
2843250 hes a first class guy and i just love having him around
2843251 the guys were clapping a little bit after baldellis hit
2843252 he got up in the box because he was facing a knuckleball pitcher which i liked the awareness was there the baseball iq is good
2843253 and he wasnt jumpy he was taking borderline pitches swung at strikes worked good at bats for his first time out in a while and of course the hit that felt good for him i just think the fact that he got out there hes going to sleep really well tonight
2843254 the possibility that we might be going to have to leave tomorrow morning
2843255 healthy people are the greatest asset of any nation and molecular screening promises better management of health risk
2843256 two sweaters a pool cue a few cds and a pocketknife from the estate of one of televisions best known faces a man who happened incidentally to be my father
2843257 having to leave my fathers deathbed so that some guy with an ice box could shuck his eyes out while they were fresh still makes me sick and furious to this day
2843258 i was in shock when i received the letter i stood there in my kitchen having four pages of this vomit being thrown at me by someone i thought i had a relationship with i dont hate chris but i dont understand why hes doing this everything he says is untrue
2843259 jerry always said he was so proud that at age 69 he didnt need glasses he said if i can give anything back i want to give my eyes i cant give my liver because i drank too much and i cant give my lungs because i smoked too much but i can give my eyes
2843260 so on his deathbed when they asked if he was an organ donor i said take his eyes chris knew nothing of this he knew nothing of what his father and i discussed for 25 years
2843261 its a very melodramatic gesture but i no longer saw the sense in maintaining a relationship with elaine
2843262 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage

2843270 weve seen many cases where blacks and other minorities have been shot for no reason people are angry but more than that they want answers
2843271 you can see where the glass was smashed on the police car
2843272 have obama pick a vice presidential candidate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican yes it will seem like smart politics at first shore up obamas lack of military experience with a hawk
2843273 no previous convictions rather than exemplary good character if what i read about him and the use of drugs is true
2843274 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
2843275 sometimes an email is just an email and this one should not be read as some sort of clue on timing of an announcement
2843276 ideals communism is better than democracy which is what the russia georgia battle is about or religion my god is better than your god my god is real youre god is fake which is what most of the middle east wars are about

2843279 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda
2843280 the doctors were working on him they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2843281 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2843282 i danced one night in a place there was a club and they asked for a guy to kind of make a striptease and i did it it was for ten minutes i needed money

2843299 sometimes local children attack us i dont know whether it is because we come from another country
2843300 im aware that researchers from the university of southampton have applied to plant some gm poplar on our land were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
2843301 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of the way they reproduce theres a huge potential for cross pollination it could have a really negative impact and cause widespread ecological damage
2843302 distract from the real solutions that we all know we have
2843303 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2843304 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2843305 ive always written it seems ive been writing for a hundred years
2843306 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2843307 sometimes things dont go the right way padraig found a good lie on the 18th when he needed one then holed a great putt he played well on the back nine and deserved it
2843308 i gave it my best i hit good putts on the last two holes and ill keep going at it until i win one of these things one good thing has happened today though this will get me into the ryder cup team so that is a positive
2843309 i struggled a bit in the middle of the round and had to tell myself to keep grinding away but hats off to padraig he played great down the stretch and made the putts when he had to
2843310 padraig is the hardest worker i have ever been involved with
2843311 i was with him in ireland two weeks before the open last month we went to the range at 10 30am it was raining heavily padraig told me to watch him hit half a dozen shots so that we could work on any problems we went back inside at 10pm
2843312 i love that in a golfer years ago i said to my wife june that i would love to get a young man who is willing to work hard at his game after padraig had been seeing me for about two months she told me i had found him and thats why he has been so successful his work rate

2843316 the guy who came over to light his cigarette was crying he was swept away by the rest of the performance
2843317 a feeling of empathy between people who have nothing in common
2843318 thats really my definition of art arts only mission is to make people feel closer
2843319 the need for laughter and tears is so natural and so strong especially for people who live in dictatorships
2843320 their first need is the feeling of empathy to find someone with whom they can share their deeper feelings for those people maybe going and attending the tazieh can be a way of relating to these very deep emotions there is a natural tendency for laughing and crying in everyone but specifically in countries in which people are oppressed
2843321 he told me youre very lucky to live in a country where there is still such innocence
2843322 i said the day that you show all my films you can also show this you cant just choose this because you consider it something religious you can use in a different way
2843323 its been getting worse and worse none of my films have been shown for the past 10 years in iran and this is not just about me its not that they have a problem with what i do its that more generally they cannot accept independent films
2843324 of course i feel pain when i see that my country is considered evil
2843325 so in all my films my wish is to give a kinder and a warmer image of human beings and of my country every morning when i wake up i have to say hello to my neighbours and this is what i like to show in my films friendship love between people
2843326 from north to south the rebellion against those who show off their money and power is growing

2843329 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins

2843331 britain faces yet more confusion on the back of this new speculation about the governments plans if gordon brown had acted prudently and put money aside for a rainy day during the good years as all our competitors did he wouldnt be floundering now floating all sorts of ideas that he doesnt know how to pay for clearly the government has learnt nothing from the damage done by speculation on stamp duty changes

2843338 is a large amount of money but it is a modest fraction of our nations wealth
2843339 benchmark as a rough floor of how much we should spend on defense
2843340 that is what gates believes to be a reasonable price to stay free and protect our interests around the world

2843342 that american leadership is good both for america and for the world and that such leadership requires military strength diplomatic energy and commitment to moral principle

2843347 we are not pre judging anybody here but this is the stand of the church
2843348 we are not condemning anybody here but we are against the bill not against congressmen as a person we are all brothers and sisters
2843349 we respect our beloved congressmen and congresswomen because they are also catholics they also have a good objective their approach is only different from the church
2843350 what we want to hear from our beloved president is the total rejection of the reproductive health bill and should make a definite statement about it
2843351 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2843352 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2843353 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2843354 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2843355 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2843356 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2843357 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2843358 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2843359 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2843360 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2843361 we arrived the fire was going well we sent two guys in first to make sure the building was evacuated got everyone out then we attacked the fire from the front and a crew went in the back as well
2843362 we knocked it down pretty well but then we had to call in more crew because the fire had extended though some of the other rooms
2843363 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2843364 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2843377 i was excited to discover that there were some mathematic areas where i could use my fathers expertise

2843388 we design our cars to deliver real world safety benefits for our customers this result is a resounding third party endorsement of the extensive safety development program undertaken for the all new fg falcon
2843389 not only is the fg falcon the safest vehicle ever produced in this country it is also competitive with the safest sedans in the world
2843390 these safety test results add further validation to the extensive crash simulation process and physical crash test program conducted by ford australia for the fg falcon which was the most comprehensive in the companys history

2843392 when you get to my age you know that you cant coach forever youre going to be getting out i havent picked a day yet hadnt set a time yet have no desire to get out but i know i cant coach forever
2843393 this is the guy thats going to follow me hes on the staff he works with these other guys so that really took the pressure off me i feel like now i can step out when i want to
2843394 ive still got things i would like to accomplish before i get out id still like to win another national championship id like to win so many games before i leave things like that but it all involves winning all of my goals involve winning so i dont feel like im stealing something away from the players
2843395 ive always said that when i retire im leaving town thats what i hope i can do i dont want to be behind the next coach i dont want him to see me looking over his shoulder
2843396 i was in awe of the dedication and concern all of the employees showed for the well being of these animals even as the addition of more than 100 dogs and cats taxed the shelter
2843397 these employees came in on their time off many adopted some of the animals from this investigation and they worked extremely long hours doing tasks that most of us would not want to do

2843399 abu dhabi is an obvious choice for a boat show as it is the richest of the oil laden united arab emirates has a large expatriate population and is aiming to transform itself into a global tourist destination
2843400 diverse sports amp leisure pursuits are part of the active lifestyle residents enjoy in abu dhabi and the most recently announced 2009 formula 1 abu dhabi prix ferrari theme park and warner brothers theme park are all situated on the yas island a 2 500 hectare island development
2843401 we have received overwhelming support from abu dhabi as the host and from the marine industry in particular with regard to the timing of the show
2843402 with the emirates boat show international in abu dhabi we will be well on the way to providing the luxury marine industry in the middle east with a year round calendar of events that marine enthusiasts could look forward to
2843403 for us at knotika boat shows are not just about boats but also everything that goes with the marine lifestyle
2843404 people do not buy a boat just to own it they want to enjoy it to live the culture and that is what we are bringing to abu dhabi this is not simply a boat show it is a marine lifestyle exhibition where they will be able to see and buy the latest coolest and must have yachts and marine products
2843405 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2843406 they told us to come out i dont know why but some of our guys are still out there in the fields
2843407 i want to go back if we lose south ossetia now it wont be for ever because we will never surrender our land
2843408 there is a lot of panic many people have left and i am thinking of joining them my bags are already packed
2843409 we are afraid that the russians will come here and kill us people would not go if we had a strong army but they dont believe in our army any more
2843410 i have left everything i dont even have another shirt if the russians stay then i can never return were afraid of what the russians can do
2843411 the russians will be here tomorrow they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now

2843420 i think its important to realize every player in the league is evaluated by everybody by us coughlin said on a conference call
2843421 you cant put words in my mouth about anything coughlin cautioned
2843422 were pleased with the two players who competed last night if progress continues well be solid in the backup position
2843423 those two have been going head to head coughlin said
2843424 certainly theres some evidence that the competition is proving to bring out the best in both of them
2843425 well have to do some discussing of that situation coughlin said
2843426 theyre a good team obviously it was a devastating series for us but weve got to rebound
2843427 every game is a playoff from now on weve dug ourselves a huge hole but weve got to come out fighting and play with a lot of urgency weve been in this situation before and were going to show what this team is made of
2843428 i never count that team out but it just shows how well were playing right now
2843429 it starts with the pitching and today we just found a way to score enough runs to win
2843430 its frustrating i hate it that i wasnt able to hold them down better than i did
2843431 they figure out a way to win and thats what good teams do
2843432 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2843433 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
2843434 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2843435 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2843436 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2843437 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2843438 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2843439 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2843440 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2843441 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
2843442 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good
2843443 its been a whirlwind for him and theres a lot of new information going in were progressing quickly
2843444 until i can see the cadence and see the mechanics
2843445 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice
2843446 there was a garnish i think and some hashbrowns and i can take you through minute by minute after that
2843447 the eggs were mixed with the hashbrowns so i dont know which one actually hit his mouth first ill film it next time

2843449 have all of you seen the movie borat how about the play romeo and juliet well what happens when you get them together and they fuuuuck nothing
2843450 theyre a good team obviously it was a devastating series for us but weve got to rebound
2843451 every game is a playoff from now on weve dug ourselves a huge hole but weve got to come out fighting and play with a lot of urgency weve been in this situation before and were going to show what this team is made of
2843452 i never count that team out but it just shows how well were playing right now
2843453 it starts with the pitching and today we just found a way to score enough runs to win
2843454 its frustrating i hate it that i wasnt able to hold them down better than i did
2843455 they figure out a way to win and thats what good teams do
2843456 it was 100 percent the right move to make i mean on the road you have to play to win
2843457 i had a good jump the catcher made a perfect throw i stole the base and everyone knows that the umpire had great position on it he just simply missed it
2843458 i thought we had a pickoff play going with richie and there was a serious miscommunication there he was actually talking to alex and alex was probably standing right behind me at third base it screwed up the inning big time
2843459 i mean he could have given up and let the yankees get a few more runs but he stepped up huge and kept us in the game
2843460 i tend to get anxious when theres a lot of noise or people hanging around my desk but i find that a short walk gets me re focused
2843461 i have preferred term for psychiatric disability that i am recovering from i can still do the things that are required by my job or if there are limitations i may have difficulty doing a specific part of my job it helps if i have name the specific accommodations you need i work best when other accommodations
2843462 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
2843463 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
2843464 he also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people
2843465 wants to speaks directly to the pakistani people and chose english because he cannot speak urdu
2843466 that was more of something they probably saw on hard knocks that the cowboys were doing so im going to get that corrected
2843467 maybe its a drill that you do individually but you dont want to do that in a team setup
2843468 the problem is that there are a lot of guys that can throw the ball
2843469 the question is can you throw the ball under pressure and realize that if its not there youve got to put it down and run the worst thing in the world is when the other colored shirt ends up catching the ball
2843470 he has some big hands and big feet but hes like a puppy hell grow into them
2843471 its great its a blessing and probably the happiest day of my life id have to say the super bowl is going to have to take a back seat
2843472 ch vez no se ir por procedimientos establecidos sino por presiones sociales
2843473 nosotros los due os del pa s cumplimos la ley
2843474 no es que nosotros queramos imponer nuestra particular visi n es que la ley est vigente y ha sido producto de amplios consensos
2843475 hay varios factores que hacen que la percepci n del riesgo sea mayor
2843476 se muestra la situaci n fiscal por lo pagado y no por lo devengado
2843477 se suma a esto que hay una fuerte ca da del precio de los productos agr colas y como lo que se va a recaudar por retenciones va a ser menos la situaci n fiscal va a estar m s comprometida
2843478 que poner seriedad en el indec actuar estructuralmente sobre el gasto generar confianza y salir del default con el club de par s y los bonistas que no entraron en el canje
2843479 la tendencia es que el a o que viene desparecer n los super vits gemelos
2843480 tiene que dejar de mentir y hacer expl cita la tasa de inflaci n real y llegar a un acuerdo con el club de par s
2843481 hay un mont n de temas que el gobierno est barriendo debajo de la alfombra
2843482 es negativo que la presidenta cristina fern ndez diga que la responsabilidad del ndice de inflaci n no es de ning n secretario porque en otras palabras lo que est diciendo es que es ella la que est mintiendo
2843483 el problema est adentro del pa s y no afuera
2843484 esta visi n negativa de la situaci n financiera argentina en el exterior es exagerada
2843485 no est dando ninguna se al faltan respuestas a esta visi n equivocada del pa s y los mercados se ponen nerviosos
2843486 hay una sobrereacci n en los mercados que no se explica porque los fundamentos de la econom a son s lidos
2843487 hay una combinaci n de rumores sobre una supuesta baja en la calificaci n de riesgo de la argentina por parte de las calificadoras y por otro cuestiones t cnicas propias del mercado
2843488 es consecuencia de la p rdida de confianza y credibilidad en el manejo financiero de las cuentas fiscales y la capacidad del pa s para refinanciar las deudas

2843499 for me to make it on top of him it takes all the wind from his sails to make that at that time you cant ask for anything more
2843500 i had no chance after scott made that putt on 17
2843501 im a little bummed that last putt cost me some money but i still moved up from where i started today i would have taken this at the beginning of the week
2843502 maybe i dont know how to play the front side properly
2843503 any exposure is good exposure and i hope people get to know me and my family

2843511 at 6 30 this morning i was going to the pool at the village and i said to bowman ive got to break 4 05
2843512 were going to get there brian johns in the 400 metre im heats that was the ninth fastest time in history and the womens 4x100 relay team is the seventh fastest time ever were pretty good thats how good this meet is
2843513 when you see that you want to be there too
2843514 i believe the most significant reason is the difference in profile before they get to the olympics
2843515 gold medals typically get some awareness and attention in canada
2843516 it doesnt mean its a bag of riches for them that is for very few athletes in this country
2843517 ive seen deals that bring maybe 50 to 100 per cent more dollars to the winter athletes
2843518 its a challenge for a lot of the summer olympians
2843519 how many people are kayakers how many are trampolinists all the summer disciplines are difficult to identify with
2843520 and i suspect that if they had a chance to increase budgets they would be spending more in vancouver not splitting it
2843521 the violations were obvious the deaths were tragic and it is our desire to send a strong message that these types of living conditions will not be tolerated
2843522 we take fire fatalities very seriously and are acutely sensitive to the importance of fire safety systems within all buildings including rooming houses and converted buildings we need citizens to know they will be safe from fire related events and that they should not be deprived of early warning devices
2843523 its very rare that somebody would be charged on this many residential charges
2843524 were now seeing the benefits of her not bonding as well with her mother
2843525 but malti likes to come with us and rani doesnt seem to mind
2843526 if her mother dried up tomorrow wed be able to feed her from the bottle
2843527 shes easy to train because she likes to be challenged
2843528 i cant speak for the others but i feel pretty proud
2843529 there are a lot more activists out there now than there used to be
2843530 there will always be those who dont want animals in zoos at all
2843531 but the elephants do very well in captivity if theyre well taken care of
2843532 i know the delay is difficult but we believe it should not be viewed as a negative development
2843533 we remain confident that the restructuring process will reach a successful conclusion
2843534 guys are playing well winning four in a row and them coming into this series obviously all expectations are to continue cleveland they came in and threw the ball well and we werent able to get the hits when we needed them
2843535 were just slowly but surely digging ourselves a hole that we have to dig out of and obviously time is running out
2843536 stranger things have happened and weve just got to play better
2843537 when we got some guys on base he seemed to reach back and get a little bit more thats the sign of a guy thats 16 2
2843538 i definitely feel like i havent pitched to the best of my ability yet and thats whats been the most frustrating part
2843539 im not worried im not nervous and i feel very confident out there i just need to work ahead a little bit more
2843540 i didnt walk anybody but i know if i locate earlier in the count its going to take away all those hits they got
2843541 an investigation is being conducted to determine the details surrounding this incident and further information will be made public when it is available
2843542 fun loving and genuine individual who was totally dedicated to the army and held his section together he looked out for his guys in ways they probably didnt realize
2843543 without private security firms it would be impossible to achieve what were achieving here there are many aspects of the mission here in afghanistan many security aspects that are performed by private security firms that which if they were turned over to the military would make our task impossible we just dont have the numbers to do everything
2843544 were very happy to get to this additional milestone in the process
2843545 we talked with hugh on the phone yesterday and to hear his voice and get the leadership from him was great
2843546 he is the guy who has been leading our squad for the last four years building to this and it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2843547 a lot of the guys had met him todd bachman and wiz elisabeth is part of the volleyball family and we have all known her for a long time we really felt the loss as being one of our own and thats why it hurt so much we were so close to them
2843548 the bachman family were great volleyball fans wiz was a wonderful player and they watched her play almost every match they were great followers and supporters of the mens and womens team
2843549 the best way we can honour them is to compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball as they did
2843550 we went into this match knowing this tragedy had happened but we also know we had invested four years and in some cases eight 12 16 years of our lives in this opportunity to see what we could do that might not mean winning a gold medal but its about playing better each day
2843551 i would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to you and the family of the victims over this unfortunate incident
2843552 after this stabbing happened it is our intention to strengthen security in scenic spots and we may add checks to ensure that no weapons are being brought into these areas beijing is a safe city but we are not immune
2843553 this was an isolated criminal act and we have reason to believe that security measures are sufficient
2843554 i cant express enough how excited i am to have started off with the time i posted in that event
2843555 i have to put that race behind me and act like it never happened
2843556 i think im as prepared as i can be at this moment
2843557 any time you think you are close to reaching him he jumps to another level
2843558 the patients love it we give them a pack developed with healthcare professionals which gives them quite a lot of information about what their condition is about and what they can do about it
2843559 we remind them about the importance of keeping warm the temperature to keep their room at exercising trying to avoid the low temperatures and seeking medical advice at an early stage
2843560 with a small adjustment to their lives in the run up to the cold weather they can significantly reduce the likelihood of their getting poorly
2843561 it helps the patients meaning they do not spend time going in and out of hospital
2843562 overall it has been fairly successful and patients are hoping it will keep going
2843563 the patients last year were contacted two or three times
2843564 this has helped the practice as well as the patients the patients are aware there is a three week period after the cold snap when they are at most risk and are more vigilant
2843565 we are more vigilant too and we know we may expect more patients
2843566 we are thinking of starting a register of weather and ailments because a lot of it so far has been anecdotal and in the distant past was perhaps dismissed by some parts of the medical profession
2843567 we are looking at asthma mental health cardiovascular disease strokes and angina which are all affected by the weather
2843568 if you are at risk of having a heart attack is there something that can be done following an alert from the met office to stop you having one thats an important question
2843569 to try to go ahead with the fight against poverty or it could just entrench the situation further

2843586 when i started making putts i just stuck in there and it brought my game up the more i got into it the better i played
2843587 i was comfortable with my game in winning the open this week i havent been as confident and comfortable but i knew i had the ability to win if i got a chance

2843600 segundo sabemos que hay funcionarios de los cuerpos de seguridad venezolanos que forman parte de estas organizaciones delictivas hace poco fueron arrestados 15 guardias nacionales que estaban conectados con los secuestros en la zona

2843623 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2843624 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2843625 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2843626 its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone

2843638 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

2843661 darwin was fascinated by questions of hair colour and the role it might play in choosing sexual partners he was keen to test whether english blondes really were more likely to stay single with a resulting decrease in blonde hair in subsequent generations
2843662 there are nine sets of calculations in which darwin and his son george who was about to take up a fellowship at cambridge combined and reanalysed the data
2843663 your apology for troubling me in this matter really made me feel ashamed i think there can be but few of us humbler cultivators of natural science who would not feel it an honour to be permitted to contribute his stone towards the building of your great edifice
2843664 sadly so far none of darwins letters to beddoe have been found there are no fewer than nine sets of calculations in which darwin and his son george who was just about to take up a fellowship in cambridge combined and reanalysed the data
2843665 eventually darwin came to the conclusion that the experimental basis was not good enough both beddoe and darwin came to the conclusion that the original results were misleading and didnt make sufficient allowance for the darkening of hair with age
2843666 he had hundreds of correspondents from all over the world as well as manuscripts seed samples plants and even dung these letters give us an insight into darwin the scientist and also darwin the man and his family life
2843667 we have had to apply a lot of detective work into these letters as few of them are actually dated while some of the words he uses do not mean the same as they do now and there are a lot of abbreviations that read a bit like modern text messages
2843668 its something akin to martial law in that particular area
2843669 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
2843670 in a way i like it because they shot up my house too
2843671 and in a way i dont like it because a few minutes ago i had to walk to the store and the police stopped me and asked me what i was doing and where i was going
2843672 first such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
2843673 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city
2843674 notwithstanding the city code and curfew order the residents of helena west helenahave the right to sit under shade trees in their front yard to ride their bicycles along the streets protest this policy and drive around the city with the full protections of the first fourth and fourteenth amendments
2843675 i invite them to move in on second street and be up all nightwith people shooting at them
2843676 since this began its more quiet and peaceful around here
2843677 i think theyre doing a wonderful job prior to this the kids were dealing drugs right in the middle of the street stopping cars saying hey hey what you got
2843678 you couldnt walk down the streets your little kids couldnt either we were just that scared
2843679 youre not free and youre supposed to be free you cant go outside and walk the streets look the entire area is empty theres nobody out here

2843689 lo que est pasando ahora no me sorprende en lo absoluto
2843690 el presidente dijo que s hubo discusi n de los decretos leyes aprobados pero eso es una mera afirmaci n
2843691 la rep blica supone que no hay absolutismo sino que hay pluralismo que no se puede imponer una idea dogm tica se pretende una imposici n y a nadie le queda de d nde agarrarse
2843692 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
2843693 i came over the line and there was so much i was just so happy and there were so many emotions that were coming out all at once i made so much noise because i guess thats just the person i am
2843694 i want to thank all the people who have been there from the start i have worked so hard i am so happy
2843695 i dont think it has sunk in yet i still feel like the normal nicole from before the race but its just so exciting
2843696 we all knew that we were good riders but the best chance that we had was to ride as a team
2843697 emma was going for her own bid for glory but it meant that i could ride defensively and also save myself i think it put the other teams on the back foot
2843698 nicole has just secured team gbs first medal and what a medal its not only gold but its britains 200th gold medal from the modern olympic games
2843699 emma and sharon did an awesome job in supporting nicole in her race for gold
2843700 i knew dropping back was a risk but the corner was very wet i knew i felt strong i knew there was a hill and no one would take it on but i could
2843701 what you cant perhaps quite sense at home is just the torrential rain that was falling on beijing and despite those incredibly tough weather conditions she won so its a wonderful victory and a huge lift for team gb
2843702 succeeding in iraq requires defending its territorial integrity and stabilizing the region in the face of extremist challenges and that begins with addressing iran and syria
2843703 we will interrupt the flow of support for iran and syria and we will seek out and destroy networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in iraq
2843704 we mourn the loss of every fallen american and we owe it to them to build a future worthy of their sacrifice
2843705 es dif cil que alguien crea que venezuela goza actualmente de estado de derecho y de garant as jur dicas estos decretos alteran muy poco la visi n sobre venezuela que se tiene en el exterior lo que hace es reforzar la idea de que ch vez es el nico que toma las decisiones en el pa s
2843706 la democracia pura y dura sin liberalismo y bajo una l gica russoniana puede consistir en que se ponga de acuerdo la mayor a para trastocar todos los cimientos de un estado sin pedir permiso porque el pueblo decide
2843707 lo que hace ch vez es desmantelar las instituciones y dificultar el intercambio entre diversos sectores sociales llama la atenci n que se publicaran los t tulos de las leyes para cumplir con los plazos legales no obstante es inaudito que los art culos se publicaran posteriormente se hizo con un oscurantismo que no se ve en ninguna democracia normal
2843708 me parece un claro abuso de los poderes que le concedi la habilitante ch vez usa procedimientos inconsultos para imponerse incluso dentro del marco constitucional hace cualquier maniobra para pasar por encima de las reglas de juego de la carta magna
2843709 el pa s sufre el riesgo de rezagarse industrial y tecnol gicamente sin duda los cambios en ciertas leyes relacionadas con la econom a y la producci n hacen inseguras las inversiones de capital privado extranjero
2843710 parec a que ch vez estaba reconociendo que no le estaba yendo bien pol ticamente a escala dom stica e internacional con esos pasos radicales puesto que llam a las farc a deponer las armas y hasta habl de cooperaci n antidrogas con estados unidos pero estas nuevas leyes nos indican que su etapa moderada pas y que su intenci n es hacer realidad el modelo pol tico que ide por qu volver a hacer algo tan impopular cuando falta tan poco para las elecciones creo que espantar a los votantes indecisos como lo hizo la vez pasada

2843716 esto no es nuevo desde el a o pasado se le dio participaci n a los consejos comunales en el control y fiscalizaci n para evitar la especulaci n y el boicot hasta ahora no ha sucedido ning n hecho irregular y por lo tanto pueden continuar actuando

2843720 that would be going to meet the drives if you dont know them you first have to go into a depression in order to meet them when you have met them you are at the bottom in the prima materia and there you touch it you meditate on it and do active imagination or you look for the underlying meaning looking at a power drive as an example you may be madly jealous of a friend who has been successul in his career and argue with yourself saying you should not be jealous that this is not fair but your self admonititions change nothing your power drive or ambition which is the cause of your jealousy is not affected or touched by what you say the red sulphur remains untouched so we need a stronger medicine to deal with this drive instead of arguing with the drives tht carry us away we prefer to cook them and decide to fantasize about them and ask them what they want one has to be quite objective without opinions and without condemning the thing as unreasonable one must try to find out amicably what the drive really wants that is what it is driving at for it has an objective that can be discovered by active imagination or through a fantasy or through experimenting in reality but always with the introverted attitude of observing objectively what the drive really wants or desires to get at that would be cooking the red sulphur generally strong drives emanate a fantasy content they comprise a bunch of fantasy material you could just as well say that to cook something until its soul appears would meant to let the fantasy material emanate from the drive allow the fantasy material connected with the drive to emerge that would be the psychological aspect and would correspond to the winged bird but when you have done that a terrible conflict begins our text 10th cent by mohammed ibin umail at tamini says that the wingless bird prevents the winged bird from flying away while the winged bird wants to raise the wingless bird and so they remain attached linked together in a kind of insolvable conflict which keeps the whole thing arrested

2843727 instead of listing your daily tasks talk about what you did that made your company better or your department more successful talk about the unique things you did so your r sum will not be the same as someone who has the same job title
2843728 on the evidence of the performances on the field of play i believe the u 18 six nations festival achieved its goal of providing a forum for development of the playing skills of the best of the u 18 players from the participating countries
2843729 one of the great benefits of the tournament is that squads of 26 players assemble for a weeks duration to train and play against countries in a competitive environment without the pressure of a winner takes all and that gave players a great introduction to international rugby
2843730 that rule ensures that all squad members have the opportunity to start a game and means that some members do not return home without playing as can be the situation in a more competitive situation
2843731 in addition to training and playing the festival exposed the players to drug testing and advice from the irish sports council on the dangers of performance enhancing substances
2843732 resulting from great coverage in the media attendances have been beyond expectations with approximately 3 000 patrons in attendance at irelands opening game against wales at musgrave park
2843733 the policy decision of free admission has been of benefit especially to the younger supporters and that is something which should continue throughout the hosting of this event in the years to come

2843752 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
2843753 but if you take all the chemistry thermal dymanics and theiries about carbon etc and take them down to basic priciples and back them up by the last hundred years of research and scientific findings then you update them with the mass of evidence from all of the recent studies if you do all this and you link to the studies the scientists and all of this is backed by facts the global warming hoax people

2843760 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2843761 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that

2843763 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way

2843793 the pastoral industry in this area has huge opportunity for development and expansion and i think theres a lot of opportunity for producers to increase and improve their business and start diluting some of the costs that are rolling in
2843794 the opportunities are based on just the huge amount of ungrazed pasture in this region these ungrazed areas with water and fences could be utilised and would allow pastoralists to spread stock out and also increase stock numbers without having a negative impact on the environment
2843795 theres a lot of focus on the lack of interest in development of up the ord expansion of the ord and expansion of the agricultural area there seems to be radio silence from the territory side im basing it on discussions with people from a number of departments
2843796 they are scared because there has been so many subdivision applications been put forward and they really dont know how to handle it
2843797 i heard some lame excuse of why they couldnt meet is because they wanted to meet in darwin and they couldnt get accommodation
2843798 the take home message here is its a big deal
2843799 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
2843800 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
2843801 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully
2843802 we think we can make people feel cooler more quickly feel comfortable more quickly and that will translate into less power in the central ac system
2843803 were going to put some collars on some feral pigs just to see where they spend their time in the landscape if its on food water or shelter mainly so that we can target where we put the traps or where we bait and be more targeted in that coordinated control rather than just blanket baiting
2843804 too hard to tell at the moment i guess its too early early days thats what biosecurity is working on but the pigs that have been calculated through the aerial surveys are about one pig per kilometre squared which is not very high at the moment
2843805 the climate change summit we had in mount isa made me fairly uncomfortable in that people are expecting to bandaid up the system in what they are living instead of going out and living economically and not using so many things
2843806 during the drought we have averaged approximately 17 per cent allocation
2843807 the darling section of the murray darling basin only contributes 17 per cent to the total flows in the murray system so what happens in the northern darling basin does have an impact on the murray
2843808 it is proportionately quite small compared to the flows that are naturally occurring in the system
2843809 this process has been going on for over three years 9 000 submissions later its been a bit of a marathon and it appears that the victorian government is trying to revisit the result by playing a game of two up and its not an appropriate way of going with this new committee
2843810 the quick action in response to the veac announcement i think has been put out there to try and ease some of the concerns of people like vafi have raised about the initial veac report
2843811 i was a little hesitant when we first brought him up here for baseball
2843812 i thought his spirit might be crushed if he got out every time then i thought who am i to micromanage his feelings hes going to have to learn how to deal with this stuff
2843813 the more i shelter him the more hell think im fragile i dont think ill ever tell him he cant do something
2843814 then i slept on it having seen him play baseball i knew hed find a way to make it work
2843815 sure enough we put him at quarterback using no crutches and used a shotgun snap he threw a lot of touchdown passes
2843816 thats what i mean when i say if you turn him loose hell find a way
2843817 because hes a good kid a good catcher and what he brings attitude wise hes an inspiration to everybody
2843818 adam has helped other kids see that a person with a disability can be fun to hang out with and play with and they can still be a part of a community or part of a team its developed the kids compassion
2843819 and if he can inspire even one family to allow their kid to try something they normally might not try thats great
2843820 hes always had that nobodys going to stop me attitude
2843821 he pops out of bed at 60 miles an hour and doesnt quit until he collapses at the end of the day hes always wanted to do everything
2843822 there will come a day when adam will no longer be able to keep up but hes had some measure of childhood where hes just like everybody else
2843823 he doesnt have to sit and watch his brother and sister play hes out there playing with them
2843824 the lesson he teaches is that you need to let talented people with great heart get out there and do their thing
2843825 theres no such thing as an insurmountable obstacle for adam
2843826 i asked them what are you doing there but they told me not to meddle
2843827 the distribution of ballot boxes election paraphernalia and automated voting machines was carried out without any problems unlike the previous election there are signs instructing voters on how to used the voting machines morale is high
2843828 we are focusing on areas in maguindanao and shariff kabunsuan especially after a breakout of hostilities between government troops and moro rebels in north cotabato
2843829 ordinarily it would take 15 45 seconds for a voter to finish the vote but since this is a new system we give three minutes time limit before the machine would lock out making the vote akin to a spoiled ballot
2843830 we expect shariff kabunsuan to be the first to transmit its results
2843831 the nsc is similar to a call center that handles inbound and outbound calls but it also serves as a knowledge base center where operators upload all acquired information into the election day management platform edmp which can help in developing quick response actions
2843832 we have installed dedicated phone lines to allow the field support technicians to provide quick updates in their designated area
2843833 to ensure that fundamental rights of our people to choose their leaders are respected
2843834 the actions of umbra kato and his defiance of government and milf orders will have to be dealt with accordingly
2843835 the current situation on the ground is very fluid and very volatile
2843836 my tales of war are the stories most asked for around the fire at night but theyre the ones i least care to tell
2843837 you are continuing to build their business if you do that versus building your own

2843854 every rivet every girder was put in there to support education so im really excited about it the kids are going to be excited and the teachers are going to be excited about it
2843855 theyre really going to get to know their teachers i think theyre really going to get to know their administrators in that small learning community
2843856 it really came organically from the parents who thought it would be a good idea to make sure we had a very nice school culture in each of those schools and that it would support that
2843857 some things to adjust to but really some great things going on from an educational perspective
2843858 the first day of school is always a wonderful time its a time for new beginnings its a time to really put your best foot forward
2843859 scotland are certainly on a high at the moment they have a real momentum going and they are enjoying their success i know there is real optimism in their camp at the moment so this is going to be a really big challenge for us
2843860 england are a team in good form and they are unbeaten all season so this is going to be a big challenge for our boys we are confident we have picked a team who can do a job at musgrave park but its going to be tough
2843861 si vous les kuznetsovs tes russes pourquoi ne vous enfuyez vous pas en russie
2843862 entrepreneurial companies tend to put in their financial plan that their first exit is that somebody will buy them out and if theyre not going to be bought out then surely theyll do an ipo neither one of those really take into consideration what the real world is
2843863 we were disappointed with our performance against scotland as we didnt do ourselves justice in terms of the basics of the game and certainly did not reach the level of play that the squad can achieve
2843864 italy are a decent side as they posed wales plenty of problems in their last game and so will not be underestimated this ireland team certainly want to end the festival on a high note with a win to give the local support something to cheer about
2843865 i dont know what im going to do after this if i cant have tim gunn just pop into my life every once in a while
2843866 because yesterday was the 13th and they usually go in sequential order
2843867 que un presidente de georgia elegido democr ticamente y cito textualmente debe irse

2843870 me gustar a decir inmediatamente que cambio de r gimen es una expresi n estadounidense

2843878 app is widely considered the worst fibre manufacturer in the world
2843879 it leaves open the possibility that as soon as they think the coast is clear they will go back to selling unsustainable product made by asia pulp amp paper
2843880 it will not deal with the many satellites of asia pulp amp paper to assist them to launder illegal or unsustainable timber by routing it through different operations and countries
2843881 transparency is the only way for woolworths to demonstrate that it is genuine in its sustainability intentions and after so much pressure its the least consumers and shareholders should expect

2843896 we have kept a list of homeowners that have expressed interest in joining our rental program and we are just getting to the point where we can reconnect with these homeowners and offer our services to them within twelve months we are looking to have upwards of 40 properties on the south oregon coast from organic growth and we will be looking into acquisitions in this area
2843897 lol omg the look on his daughters face is priceless
2843898 know what on second thought mr president please dont make an effort to resolve the crisis in georgia okay i think well all be better off
2843899 the practice of mps using taxpayer money to smear their opponents in other ridings has got to stop
2843900 a document with an electoral intent and seems to contravene the bylaws
2843901 if mr holland is so concerned about tax dollars why isnt he looking for the 40 million stolen during the liberal sponsorship scandal
2843902 no youre going to have a hard time finding that bike
2843903 im here for my country first and foremost but also for everyone whos ever had to deal with this around the world
2843904 people kind of look at me as an inspiration but the people who send me those messages and stories theyre my inspiration especially since a lot of them are in far worse situations than im in right now
2843905 thats kind of been weighing on me the most since ive been here just the fact that i still have this in my body and there is still some risk to it the doctors have told me ill be fine ill be cured of it but i just want to hurry up and be done with it already
2843906 it does take away a little bit from this experience
2843907 ive just tried to minimize it as much as i can i dont want to think about it and i dont want to dwell on it but sometimes thats hard because its such a big deal
2843908 the first few days you feel bad for him then its almost like you forget he has it
2843909 hes part of the team i cant believe what hes going through but he still has that drive to be here and do his best
2843910 but his goal was to swim at the olympic games and hes excited were all supporting each other in everything we do
2843911 we were trying to figure out why he was being so coy and turning up to training late
2843912 the olympics look a lot smaller when youre dealing with something like cancer
2843913 it gives us an idea that what were doing here isnt as high on the pedestal as we sometimes put it on were going to be behind him every step of the way it doesnt end here
2843914 im really happy i did that it was one of the best experiences for a sporting event ive ever been to in my life
2843915 the coaches were worried about us being on our feet being hot but i dont care that was something i always wanted to do if i ever made the team
2843916 if its not cancer on my mind its getting up on that podium

2843923 john edwards also elzabeth edwards statement was edwards affair the explosive prez candidate story the la times sat on posted by gabrielle cusumano on sunday august 10 2008 9 28 53 pm the la times was sitting on a sex scandal story involving a democrat presidential candidate since last october everyone assumed that the sex scandal story that the la times was sitting on was hillary being a lesbian bet this is it particularly given the timing the la times was holding back on the story at about the same time that the enquirer broke it sitting on explosive prez candidate story
2843924 so i was down in dc this past weekend and happened to run into a well connected media person who told me flatly unequivocally that everyone knows the la times was sitting on a story all wrapped up and ready to go about what is a potentially devastating sexual scandal involving a leading presidential candidate
2843925 everyone knows meaning everyone in the dc mainstream media political reporting world
2843926 to read fiction means to play a game by which we give sense to the immensity of things that happened are happening or will happen in the actual world by reading narrative we escape the anxiety that attacks us when we try to say something true about the world this is the consoling function of narrative the reason people tell stories and have told stories from the beginning of time
2843927 the songs are beautifully crafted in that davies weller doherty english tradition
2843928 in romanticising seediness as on the splendidly louche buzzards and crows and surrendering to the fact that britain will never be the
2843929 sure theres a residual whiff of mediocrity here but carls clearly found something else in himself as part of this new gang and as dirty pretty things music grows in assurance it appears pete will remain a solitary man for some time yet
2843930 taking into account the great things expected of those once promising likely lads romance at short notice offers only more disappointment
2843931 carl barat must be nostalgic for 2001 when he was in the countrys best band and anyone could make a living out of smearing dickensian romanticism over chord sequences stolen from the clash nowadays his post pete doherty project evinces dreary futility he thinks hes morrissey but he sounds more like sandi thom
2843932 goods identified with cheap logos become the brunt of regular name calling and bullying the geek is isolated
2843933 a lot of advertising companies blatantly target children without any consideration for the parents of those children
2843934 it is incredibly sad to hear how many youngsters are bullied or isolated for not having the same clothes or accessories as their classmates
2843935 advertising and marketing have made our society increasingly image conscious and our children are suffering the consequences
2843936 schools and colleges should be places where all children feel equal but it is virtually impossible for schools to protect their pupils from the harsher aspects of these commercial influences
2843937 we are worried these pressures will further intensify as schools and colleges look for more help from commercial sponsors to provide it sports and science equipment teaching materials and food
2843938 advertising and marketing are just a small part of a much wider range of influences on children in todays consumer society childrens attitudes and values are primarily formed by the culture they live in and their personal contacts their families and friends
2843939 the advertising industry in the uk takes a responsible approach and there are strong and effective advertising controls that require special care to be taken as regards children
2843940 advertising brings many benefits it improves consumer choice ensures a diverse and pluralistic media and helps fund cultural and sporting events such at the olympics
2843941 the technology is there now to allow people to be connected and to be heard in ways that have never been done before
2843942 what were trying to do is use the power of technology to basically leverage peoples personal political power and make it that much stronger were not doing it from a party perspective were doing it from a people perspective
2843943 we had been thinking of this as a way to connect people to their politics in a normal way
2843944 everybodys got a video camera now we just figured be your own campaign strategist if youre sitting back on the couch what would you want to see on television
2843945 if thats what people want to do im not going to discourage it
2843946 were trying to make it easier for everybody to have more information
2843947 nehalem is going to be about more performance and people always want more performance
2843948 if you look at what intel is doing towards desktops and laptops chips by integrating graphics that could very well reduce power consumption
2843949 the core i7 brand is the first of several new identifiers
2843950 the anatomy of a subway hack breaking crypto rfids amp magstripes of ticketing systems
2843951 it probably took us less than five minutes to get the balloon airborne
2843952 the anatomy of a subway hack breaking crypto rfids amp magstripes of ticketing systems
2843953 we can go into a company if they need help with a security awareness program
2843954 there are an amazing amount of things that we could see by watching the traffic go by
2843955 we were saying there are so many of them they are everywhere
2843956 the court ultimately came to a very very wrong conclusion
2843957 the anatomy of a subway hack breaking crypto rfids amp magstripes of ticketing systems
2843958 the first notice that the mbta provided that they were going to the court was after they had gone to the court
2843959 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code programs or similar type of information to a computer and does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans
2843960 reflects the courts view that they believe that the massachusetts bay transit authority was likely to succeed on the merits we think thats actually not the case
2843961 courts have found that the first amendment covers these things
2843962 we believe that this is a protected speech activity when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that is something that should be protected
2843963 the patients love it we give them a pack developed with healthcare professionals which gives them quite a lot of information about what their condition is about and what they can do about it
2843964 we remind them about the importance of keeping warm the temperature to keep their room at exercising trying to avoid the low temperatures and seeking medical advice at an early stage
2843965 with a small adjustment to their lives in the run up to the cold weather they can significantly reduce the likelihood of their getting poorly
2843966 it helps the patients meaning they do not spend time going in and out of hospital
2843967 overall it has been fairly successful and patients are hoping it will keep going
2843968 the patients last year were contacted two or three times
2843969 this has helped the practice as well as the patients the patients are aware there is a three week period after the cold snap when they are at most risk and are more vigilant
2843970 we are more vigilant too and we know we may expect more patients
2843971 we are thinking of starting a register of weather and ailments because a lot of it so far has been anecdotal and in the distant past was perhaps dismissed by some parts of the medical profession
2843972 we are looking at asthma mental health cardiovascular disease strokes and angina which are all affected by the weather
2843973 if you are at risk of having a heart attack is there something that can be done following an alert from the met office to stop you having one thats an important question
2843974 if there is nothing that can be done to prevent it then it is probably better for the met office to stay out of it if there is then we may have a part to play
2843975 are mainly complementary as they have hubs in different us cities
2843976 remain confident that we will be able to finalize the merger by the end of the year
2843977 while every intelligence agency has grown there are now more civilian contractors than the entire civil work force and even the penetration of hostile countries intelligence is outsourced to giant corporations
2843978 but shes adopted i mean not by me i mean i placed her for adoption
2843979 ah so you have a 20 month old are you parenting her yourself
2843980 you are always excited about the final games at a tournament and this is no different were asking the boys to keep their focus until the final whistle tomorrow and if we do that we can do well
2843981 to win three out of three would be a great achievement and would be a reward for all the hard work that has been put in
2843982 we want to be more consistent throughout the game and play well throughout the team needs to be aggressive and strong in defence and we hope that everyone has learned a lot from the mistakes of the past two games good players dont make the same mistakes twice so we hope to be better in our final game
2843983 la complejidad de la segregaci n residencial y su impacto en los partos prematuros relacionados con la salud y los resultados han sido pasados por alto en la literatura de la salud
2843984 creemos que la asociaci n entre la segregaci n residencial y un mayor riesgo de parto prematuro est relacionada con el entorno de los barrios negros en los que las mujeres viven
2843985 we want to go home with at least one win under our belts we expect a tough game from ireland because they want to win a game as well but we hope to be better than we were against wales
2843986 the players are working hard during the training sessions and we want to win so it will be good to get the match underway
2843987 if there is a cold snap coming patients can get their shopping in beforehand or contact their doctors and get their prescription early so they are not exposed to the low temperatures
2843988 i found this system to be very useful in planning and ordering of medication and adjusting lifestyle to take account of the weather conditions
2843989 being aware of detrimental weather conditions enables people to plan ahead and avoid situations that could aggravate their condition
2843990 it should not be seen as a replacement for other important services such as pulmonary rehabilitation classes which increase lung fitness and specialist respiratory nurses which play a vital role in keeping people with copd healthy and out of hospital although access to them is patchy across the uk
2843991 we are proud that the te moak diabetes program has agreed to become a national showcase club for kids pace express
2843992 we are very excited about being the first native american facility in the us to offer this much needed program this reflects our commitment to our community by offering the highest quality equipment program and services this has taken a long time to develop but we are thrilled that we are finally here to help the kids
2843993 we are looking forward to introducing kids into fitness in a fun way and seeing the results the kids will experience with this new program with the kids pace express program there is no intimidation or peer pressure since there are no weight stacks or muscle soreness the hydraulic machines will match the effort of each child so everyone will be working at their own pace we expect to have lots of fun and to see lots of smiles and sweat
2843994 no matter how paranoid or conspiracy minded you are what the government is actually doing is worse than you imagine
2843995 i dont see how dan can live with himself i think hes americas player but it still doesnt make it okay he doesnt even feel bad about it

2844006 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2844007 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2844008 the vice president expressed the with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2844009 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2844010 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2844011 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2844012 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2844013 they are just working me in to see what i can handle what they gave me was pretty good
2844014 the doctor of the future will give no medicine but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease

2844021 the court did not characterize the constitutional right that the plaintiffs in that case sought to obtain as a right to interracial marriage and did not dismiss the plaintiffs constitutional challenge on the ground that such marriages never had been permitted in california instead the perez decision focused on the importance to an individual of the freedom to join in marriage with the person of ones choice it is a fundamental right of free men
2844022 if that were an accurate and adequate explanation for the absence of such a limitation it would follow that in instances in which the state is able to make a determination of an individuals fertility without such an inquiry it would be constitutionally permissible for the state to preclude an individual who is incapable of bearing children from entering into marriage
2844023 one trick ponies and knee jerk zealots of all stripes in all domains are always crashing bores the fact that the point theyre unimaginatively hammering away on might sometimes be a correct one is immaterial to me
2844024 simplistic bombastic haranguing uncritical categorical pronouncements and holy than thou posturing in the place of analysis and discrimination and thought does
2844025 shane you always mean well how much i appreciate the intensity you bring to the cause but your methods for rallying the troops is about as effective at getting our attention as driving a nail through our collective temples
2844026 if you are not part of the solution then you are part of the problem
2844027 arizona republics endorsement of aclu tim for county attorney predictable
2844028 these guys are amazing and this is the best team ive ever seen together just like john force and amatos teams in their time
2844029 its unbelievable not only have we won a lot of races but weve won some of the most difficult races with so much pressure and for whatever reason i feel like i am driving my best right now weve got a great team and a great car and the whole package has come together i dont want to be the weak link in our team so i am working harder than ever when you have the car thats supposed to win thats a lot of pressure i was even nervous in the first round today even though it was a bye run now we head to reading pa and the pressure will be even bigger with people asking how we are going to win five in a row
2844030 this is the toughest funny car era to be racing in so bad luck on my part
2844031 this is my first win at brainerd and im really happy to win here every round today was a big challenge to me and the toughest was racing john force hes a great competitor and it was a tough race like i thought theres never a dull moment racing him our car preformed well today and we had great conditions im just happy to win a race here today and give great entertainment to all these great fans
2844032 we were a little behind at first and kept working on it and the car kept getting faster and faster we had to make some small changes today but overall our chevrolet was pretty flawless we get pumped up to race here with all of our friends and family that come out and it does add some pressure but you just have to perform once i get inside the car its really easy to focus
2844033 we debuted a brand new bike this weekend and it ran great to be the no 1 qualifier and win the race that says it all it was a really fast bike well get these kidney stones cleared up and be ready for reading
2844034 i dont see how dan can live with himself i think hes americas player but it still doesnt make it okay he doesnt even feel bad about it
2844035 did getting jessie out benefit me does getting anyone out benefit me
2844036 sorry guys gotta have somethin of mine that i keep in this house cant be showin the marbles
2844037 who still gets pimples at 24 its me its me

2844039 i dont know what im going to do after this if i cant have tim gunn just pop into my life every once in a while

2844047 do you want to swim with the dolphins this afternoon burn off the calories
2844048 and youll receive tji updates directly via email dont worry although were strapped for cash we wont be selling your address to third party scumbag spammers
2844049 it is an easy way to network in person with other people around me in my job i meet lots of people i socialise with them so its quite natural that i give them my name cards so that they do not remember me and in return i collect their name cards
2844050 all these go into a box but before i put them away i always index them properly and i scribble on the cards when and where i had met the person its prudent that i do that so that i can remember how i met them
2844051 to me networking is important because you can never know when you may need their help either professionally or on a personal basis for example i actually landed my previous job through my network a friend recommended that i applied for the job because she heard that the company was looking for someone with a certain skill to fill a certain position so i did and i got the job
2844052 its gonna be 35 33 32 but dont ask me who is going to get which
2844053 vorig jaar versloeg ik tommy robredo maar dit is nog mooier vandaag deed ik alles goed ik weet niet of ik dit niveau zal kunnen aanhouden maar het is hoe dan ook een prachtige zege
2844054 ik ben blij dat ik hier de finale heb gehaald
2844055 zeker als je weet dat ik pas sinds zondag terug kan spelen nadat ik een poos mijn nek zelfs niet kon bewegen waardoor hij forfait moest geven voor cincinnati red
2844056 its a little bit unsafe to be honest i myself lock this door at night
2844057 the problem is that there is nothing preventing wasps from just billing a number out of the blue there are rules and an industry watchdog waspa but the rules are generally not enforced
2844058 when a cellular user complains about being billed for content they never asked to receive wasps typically refund them generally after a struggle and the complaint goes away juicy profits are made because countless users never notice the subtraction of these small amounts or simply dont know how to go about complaining
2844059 should a subscriber find any unauthorised wasp charges on their bills they should contact their mobile service provider to find out who is charging them for these services
2844060 it is the companys policy to be completely transparent with regards to its charging plans and at all times ensures that it is acting in a responsible manner when it markets its business
2844061 we do not have any consumer facing products so we dont bill anyone it is our clients who offer these services and bill the subscribers
2844062 in cases of the recycled sims we do investigate those complaints in detail we ask for proof of date of purchase and thereafter if we find that it is a recycled sim we then provide with a refund
2844063 in the case of monthly billed subscription services after the initial lack of funds response from mtn the wasp will only be permitted to re submit 24 hours after the first request should this re submit get a lack of funds response from mtn the wasp will be allowed to re submit the request 30 days later
2844064 should this last request receive a lack of funds response from mtn the wasp will be required to cancel the subscription services on the wasps systems against the service users msisdn
2844065 at school i couldnt have sat down and said what i wanted to do there were those kids who knew what they wanted to do and had their hearts set on it
2844066 anyware has said theyd like me to consider this as working on my own company so thats fantastic
2844067 new zealand stands on its own two feet they realise were a different market and theyre not putting on me that i follow the australian trend that means i can not just listen to my customers but action it
2844068 rather than having tunnel vision i can look outside the square it gives me a bit of an edge because i can look at similar circumstances now and say we could try this or try that as long as the employer is prepared to give you that bit of rope
2844069 in my experience in the spca you generally see the bad side of people you dont normally see the re homing and things like that which is a bit disheartening
2844070 i used to make the most of something older to make it perform as best i could so i guess when youre given the tools and finances to make it out of the latest and greatest it pays off
2844071 our competition was more the little corner shop operating on one mark margin now a lot of those corner shops are realising they have to make a bit more margin to stay in business so now theyre coming up in price or theyre disappearing
2844072 its only in the last month ive really started to feel comfortable in the role
2844073 everything has been tightened down like you wouldnt believe every parcel is checked
2844074 the south island is like another country its almost like the rivalry between australia and new zealand having a branch in the south island would be advantageous for us and weve got some strong adopters for anyware there
2844075 a high proportion of our business over the year has been secured through rigorous selection processes while it is extremely satisfying to regularly prevail the cost of sale can be significant it is important that we maintain a healthy balance sheet
2844076 i see the next 12 months as a consolidation period
2844077 weve had a lot of customers asking us to be in wellington the opportunity to act on these requests is fantastic
2844078 it is very exciting we cant see anything stopping us from expanding in our chosen target market
2844079 we are moving immediately to recruit in both those areas
2844080 it was an extremely successful reseller it had everything going for it
2844081 we will look to retain those and grow the business
2844082 by virtue of this acquisition there will be some larger customers that we will continue to nurture
2844083 when writing the business plan they decided to stay away from the notion of a personal computer since the bankers they were talking to had no idea what a computer was or wasnt
2844084 so for the first product they needed something they could get off the ground with existing technology but the notion from the get go was to build a personal computer firm
2844085 noyce said it was an intriguing idea and that intel could do it but it would be a dumb move
2844086 he said that if you have a computer chip you can only sell one chip per computer while with memory you can sell hundreds of chips per computer
2844087 could go to 16 000 bytes of memory and if you were going to spend that much on memory then there was no sense in saving maybe 50 on the processor by moving it out of ttl
2844088 these were industrial strength products they were trying to downsize mainframe business applications
2844089 roche said the idea that you can print a computer on a chip is astounding a profound innovation and we should own the intellectual property
2844090 they said why spend 50 000 for a product we cant use it was one of the worst business decisions in history
2844091 i can look at a current pc and still see the image of that original machine buried down in there with a lot of other stuff especially more registers
2844092 current ibm plans and directions which are subject to change
2844093 will combine with the flexibility and connectivity of the apple iphone to be built on the time tested ibm lotus domino web access infrastructure users will be able to quickly access e mail calendars and contacts through the rich apple iphone user experience
2844094 sustainability is all about saving for future generations and having people have the same things we have
2844095 music festivals generate a lot of waste and to go to zero waste is the easiest way for us to make a difference
2844096 a lot of rodeos you can win with a six second time here you have win witha four
2844097 one of the things the cowboys come here for is for the enter twice team roping that allows them to compete two times while the other rodeos only have one
2844098 theres a specialty event the hide race thats a lot of fun to watch locals get involved in it
2844099 for example an insurance adjuster can access claim details while on the road when previously this data resided in a terminal based application
2844100 were bringing forward a concerted effort to heighten the focus on the mobility capability that exists at ibm today to let customers access data and applications from the growing number of mobile devices
2844101 all my instincts they return and the grand facade so soon will burn
2844102 all my instincts they return and the grand facade so soon will burn
2844103 i still dont know what happened on that it was about a 10 hopper through the infield
2844104 it was almost like our guys froze ill have to take a look at it but in no way did i think that was going to win the game
2844105 i think thats the perfect example of a seeing eye single
2844106 i dont know if he didnt see the ball very well but he didnt get a good break from second
2844107 there are a lot of white shirts out there in the stands i dont know if gary saw the ball right off the bat
2844108 he had the play beat but his hand came off the bag
2844109 i was being aggressive i knew if i got a pitch to hit i was going to swing
2844110 once i saw wilson betemit break back to first base i knew it was getting through
2844111 it was one of those things where you can almost see it happening in slow motion
2844112 i think betemit has played on the left side more
2844113 that right side orientation sometimes takes a little getting used to cano was at double play depth and it just kind of squeaked through
2844114 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
2844115 there will be a level of redundancies theres obviously efficiency to be achieved
2844116 there is a voluntary offer on the table and we would hope that the voluntary offer would achieve the targets
2844117 the workforce had a very frank and open discussion with us afterwards and they have been given an explanatory statement outlining whats involved
2844118 last april we were looking at a very serious situation with over 400 jobs to be lost
2844119 now there is an opportunity to secure the majority of the jobs but there are issues which workers will have to reflect on over the next 48 hours
2844120 inevitable that interest rates will fall one hopes not too late
2844121 however the real problem is not the cost of money so much as the availability of it
2844122 will banks lend to each other and to new and old customers
2844123 we are at a daunting economic crossroads domestically and worldwide albeit at levels of prosperity we deemed impossible 20 or 30 years ago so the question facing the government and the country is quo vadis
2844124 the drama of the freddie mac and fannie mae in the us the two gigantic mortgage lenders the enormous crisis in the banking system which has led to write offs in excess of 250 billion in the capital of major banks in the us to date it has made a dramatic impact upon the psychology of americans and the capacity of its banking system to rally to the needs of america and of the world similar problems abound in europe and in ireland
2844125 ireland is now thanks to its tax status in europe and thanks to foreign direct investment of around 1
2844126 companies such as pfizer google dell microsoft and intel our financial services centres the eight pharmaceutical giants ranging from wyeth to merck sharp dohme and my former company heinz are all residents manufacturing in ireland for foreign markets
2844127 the good news is that exports are up by 4 4 per cent this year and these companies are largely unaffected by domestic sales though they are affected by world demand they will sustain a level of economic activity which was not present in past times when emigration was the sole refuge of so many people and which is i think locked in the folk memory of a great many of us in this room
2844128 would the ireland of today be a better country than that which we have achieved by our partition our fractures the bloodshed and the qualified reconciliation that we currently enjoy particularly in the context of a european community
2844129 without any tangible information coming out of the negotiations which have been shrouded in secrecy it is very difficult for zimbabweans to be optimistic that the current negotiations will yield anything for them because what they are looking at is the characters and the true record of the two political parties zimbabweans have experienced previous unity agreements before and they have seen the level of intransigence particularly on the part of the zanu pf and they are quite doubtful that anything is going to come out of these negotiations
2844130 because of the level of suffering in the country zimbabweans would want a solution to come out of it that is why they are waiting anxiously for it
2844131 they are quite right because over the last one and a half weeks the focus of the negotiations have been to say what is going to be mugabes role what is going to be tsvangirais role how long is going to be the transition or the government of national unity and i think the most important thing in these negotiations is to say who has got the mandate to be leading this process and what are the issues to be tackled what are we going to do with the perpetrators of violence are we going to grant them amnesty or is there going to be justice or what is going to be the framework of the transitional arrangement so all those issues have not been teased out
2844132 im now worried that we are now having political parties coming up with a deal that might be in their best interest and leaving behind the people of zimbabwe who should be major beneficiaries of it
2844133 i think the mdc is under immense pressure because if you look at what has been going on where the media has been talking about say there are very few issues that have been left under the current negotiations they are about to sign one of the pressures is coming from south african president thabo mbeki who is going to be taking on the chairpersonship of sadc southern african development community this week he would want to go to sadc with a deal to show that the negotiations of zimbabwe has worked
2844134 it tends to hide the fact that the vast majority of the work he did was for ordinary people
2844135 the taoiseach who is on holiday in galway was very upset for us because this is the second year in a row that we have had to pull the plug on the day before the event
2844136 a lot will depend on the morale of the committee which has been working flat out for months on this and of course the financial losses we have to face however it is the morale particularly of the key people like the secretary freda kinnarney
2844137 you might expect to get one very bad sunday in august now and again but not two in a row
2844138 my instinct would be to press ahead again and try and hold it next year come hell or high water
2844139 we brought in over a kilometre of steel trackway at a cost of 30 000 from scotland to run it around the site and we had to lay it ourselves over the bank holiday weekend
2844140 however we could not believe it when on saturday evening almost at the same time as it had happened one year before the sky opened and we were left with no alternative but to cancel because of the ground conditions
2844141 ive been in kara once someone beat me on the roll for those epic bracers so thats why im in greens

2844144 you know you can give 100 per cent today padraigs experience counts this is a mental test and a strategy test and that suits him
2844145 you tend to calm down a bit more and realise what you have to do we are not used to seeing this kind of set up at the pga but its still a major so youve just got to get on with things and keep playing hard
2844146 they set an exceptionally high standard we are very disappointed but it is no horror to lose to a team like that
2844147 id be the last one to be saying that it is going to take a huge performance from either tipp or waterford a huge huge effort i would say after that display kilkenny will be in the driving seat in the final against either of the two
2844148 there were a lot of serious questions asked at training in the last few weeks
2844149 and lads had to stand up and give answers today
2844150 it is brilliant to be involved in the all ireland final
2844151 its something we dont maybe appreciate hugely we live at a time when we are lucky to have this opportunity to prepare for an all ireland final
2844152 this is a massive ask again to take on the winners of tipp and waterford it is the be all and end all all ireland final day is the greatest day of the year we look forward to it and we will work towards it
2844153 the opening ceremonies for the 2008 summer olympics masterfully blended the historic richness of the silk road and the modern vibrancy of the hi tech world
2844154 beijing olympic organizers dazzled an audience of 91 000 at the birds nest stadium and another estimated 4 billion watching on television friday with a colorful imaginative opening ceremony that bridged ancient and modern chinese history
2844155 a spectacle so grand and details so small that it would have been shame to watch them in streaming video on a laptop
2844156 for 60 minutes more than 15 000 chinese performers marched and twirled and beamed with flawless precision
2844157 chinas athletic ascent like its economic growth can only be described with superlatives
2844158 this is the worst possible form of cost savings as it is hitting the most vulnerable members of our community
2844159 failure to provide this service could result in children being placed in extremely dangerous situations
2844160 if we are serious about protecting children we need a properly resourced 24 hour professional social care service
2844161 that service needs to include an early response mechanism when concerns are raised and a crisis response to emergency situations as they arise
2844162 nor do we want to see innocent children sleeping in a amp e departments or police stations as a 15 year old boy recently did because there is no care plan in place for troubled youngsters outside of normal working hours

2844178 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2844179 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2844180 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2844181 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2844182 there is a provision under section 3 n of the election offences act that says that any attempt to prohibit a person from voting is an offence those found guilty could be jailed two years or fined rm5 000
2844183 some situations take courageous decisions with regard to the political future
2844184 sometimes there are democratically elected or semi democratically elected leaders who do things which create grave problems for their countries
2844185 so sometimes those leaders should contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2844186 for me it confirms that what the russian federation is seeking through this military aggression and invasion is to change the democratically elected georgian government
2844187 the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe those days are gone
2844188 this statement ambassador is absolutely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
2844189 shows that the secretariat of the united nations and its leadership was not able to adopt that objective position that is required by the substance of this conflict

2844251 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area

2844339 first of all i call him mk because its easier to pronounce he had 14 sacks one year at washington state hes got some natural rush ability he did some good things we really signed him in case derrick harvey held out we were going to give him a chance and we told him when we signed him that look if harvey reports tomorrow youre going to be gone after one day but wed like to get a look at you and he was eager to get into camp and hes done a nice job for himself hes come in here and worked hard hes got some decent size and has a frame that he can grow a little bit and he has done a nice job representing himself taking advantage of the opportunity and given himself a shot to make a favorable impression so well see a couple weeks into it hes done a nice job working at it
2844340 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2844341 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2844342 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2844343 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2844344 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2844345 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2844346 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2844347 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2844348 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2844349 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2844350 one sees clearly only with the heart anything essential is invisible to the eyes
2844351 i played a very good week and today i played unbelievable
2844352 i dont think roddick was 100 per cent but i played unbelievable to win i beat tommy robredo last year but to beat roddick in the united states i think is the best win of my career
2844353 i could have played really well and i am not sure it would have mattered i missed a few returns but other than that i was ok
2844354 i would have thought that would make it extremely unlikely he said
2844355 i would have thought 12 wins would have to get you in the eight
2844356 i should go for a run i should go to the grocery store i should go scoop the litter
2844357 how about i want to i feel like it sounds nice to

2844396 putting waste water on our mountain is like pissing in a catholic church
2844397 dividing the number of instance of profanity by the number of pages of the sites on which they appear then multiplying the result by 100 yields what might be called a profanity quotient
2844398 thats quite a disparity liberals are more than 12 times as likely to use profanity as conservatives on the web
2844399 more than likely it is a reflection of how things are offline conservatives especially those who are more religious are less likely to use profanity in their daily conversation

2844405 by creating graphical displays you can show 900 times more information in the same amount of screen space
2844406 every time ive done a visualization ive been surprised with the result
2844407 if we overestimate the demand for our services and therefore overbuild our data center capacity our operating margins could be materially reduced which would materially impair our profitability
2844408 the problem in the past has been the expense of geothermal energy generation
2844409 the pipes affect the migration of wild animals and where we can graze our cattle
2844410 now they are drilling wells on either side of our valley it scares off the animals also the vegetation has changed
2844411 the huge benefits of course are that you are getting indigenous electricity which doesnt rely on expensive oil imports
2844412 the other benefit is that you dont get any co2 emissions
2844413 we have intensified exploration of geothermal resources because we want to find a way to bring the cost of power down and hopefully bring in investors by 2030 at least 80 percent of kenyans will have power
2844414 you find the same geological formations in southern sudan where there is a lot of oil
2844415 this bill requires the governor to proclaim may 22 as harvey milk day the designation of a day of significance triggers statutory encouragement for public schools to observe and conduct commemorative exercises suitable to the day
2844416 this bad bill will teach impressionable schoolchildren the anti religious homosexual bisexual transsexual agenda of harvey milk
2844417 if signed into law ab 2567 will mean an official day commemorating homosexuality bisexuality and transsexuality in california government schools this will harm children as young as children as young as kindergarten
2844418 weve identified and blocked the ability to link to the malicious websites from anywhere on facebook less than 002 per cent of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware

2844422 if you look at what intel is doing towards desktops and laptops chips by integrating graphics that could very well reduce power consumption
2844423 the core i7 brand is the first of several new identifiers
2844424 antivirus engines have complementary detection capabilities and a combination of many different engines can improve the overall identification of malicious and unwanted software
2844425 this model enables identification of malicious and unwanted software by multiple heterogeneous detection engines in parallel a technique we term n version protection
2844426 the genius of this is that its completely reusable they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over
2844427 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
2844428 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
2844429 this is not insanely technical these two guys are capable of the really low level technical attacks but this is simple and reusable
2844430 while most organizations care about reducing energy consumption and could achieve significant savings success comes only with sharp persistent focus on energy efficiency opportunities throughout the it organization
2844431 if your dsl equipment is connected to the boundary termination socket then the quality of the cabling plays a huge part in the sync speed that can be obtained the higher the quality cable the better

2844438 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2844439 i thought we came out very fast and i thought we finished even faster which was real important after the first scrimmage
2844440 especially with the heat it would have been a great opportunity for some guys to take a day off and pack it in and go through the motions we didnt do that and i was really really pleased
2844441 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now

2844445 no we did not receive any money back from the obama campaign at any time
2844446 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza

2844460 it put levels of particulate matter pm10 at 191 micrograms per cubic meter
2844461 this far exceeds the who target of 50 micrograms cubic meter and also exceeds the who target for developing countries of 150 micrograms cubic meter
2844462 however we are missing the point by having so much attention on the short term exposure while the long term exposure is really ignored that is where we have a problem
2844463 the fog you see is based on humidity and heat it does not mean that this fog is the same as pollution
2844464 not yet we are not through but we will continue tomorrow
2844465 best temporary measure to extricate the country from its worst situation
2844466 how does a western country publicly pronounce that they will not recognise a government unless it is led by a particular leader without undermining the credibility and integrity of that individual

2844470 in the beginners mind there are many possibilities in the experts there are few
2844471 i think it gives students a sense that it really is possible to have a career in art
2844472 it may be something a lot of students say i like to do that and when they see it firsthand they may choose to be a career artist
2844473 they the artists have a lot to offer in teaching how to accomplish an effect in a certain medium
2844474 some of this is really spectacular some of what ive seen is amazing

2844482 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2844483 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2844484 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2844485 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2844486 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2844487 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2844488 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2844489 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2844490 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2844491 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
2844492 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
2844493 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

2844498 i heard the crowd obviously we had offers but they were not enough so we decided he needed to stay with us
2844499 it is not positive that we may not have the players we want here before the champions league game the situation has been very difficult for us we have had a lot of players returning to training late after international games in the summer and now we have players at the olympics
2844500 i believe we are ready for the champions league tie the experienced players are ready but we know that we have quality from the young players
2844501 i think fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this draw
2844502 from a personal point of view it is disappointing but we have to concentrate on kaunas and not rangers
2844503 before the euros i didnt know how it felt to win but now that i have experienced it i know what it takes
2844504 chelsea hadnt won anything in many years they got experienced players in won the league and that gave them the confidence together sometimes that is the key
2844505 everyone said before last season that we werent going to finish among the top four and we proved them wrong but we were halted at the gates of success and thats hard it has to serve as a lesson this season
2844506 i have not spoken to any media so its frustrating to read quotes that i have supposedly said about my future
2844507 i think that some people are just trying to make mischief but my intentions are very clear i am happy here at arsenal my future is with arsenal and the priority is to achieve success and win trophies at arsenal

2844514 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

2844526 i thought we came out with some energy and we were knocking the ball around well up until the point where we scored
2844527 i dont know this was an important game its against a rival and its a league game there were no excuses looking past this one
2844528 jaimes back was hurting it was hard on him unfortunately we were chasing the game down so we wanted to match a couple of guys and unfortunately it didnt work that way we had to try to get back into the game
2844529 it was going straight towards the far end i thought i had it with my head but i went up for it and didnt get it and it went in theres not really much you can do about it it just kind of happens
2844530 i honestly couldnt tell you we were playing our game we were getting into tackles running balls but we kind of just faded out
2844531 i think that we got what we deserved all the guys today showed great commitment and they executed and carried out the way we planned the game
2844532 i think for me personally the best thing was that after we conceded their first shot on goal i thought the guys reacted very well to equalize the game and then end up at halftime up 2 1 that was very good to see that prior to this game every time we went down one to nil we didnt come out on top
2844533 we said that we wanted someone that could organize the back he did that and also showed some very good distribution which we have been lacking in the past so i think he was very committed and good on the ball i have to say that it was too early to get a yellow card but it showed his willingness to compete
2844534 it was even more valuable for the morale the way the game turned out to be was that it was more important to come back from the one nil deficit the game showed we are very resilient and that we have a lot of character because everyone competed and fought hard
2844535 i thought it was very important i stated before the game that it was important points wise but that team morale was very important that we believe in the way that we are playing it was huge that the team responded very well today i cant just go and praise anyone individually because it was a great team effort in the end we have to build on this and hopefully we can repeat the same performance on sunday and we will see what the outcome will be but we will build off this
2844536 we marked this game on the calendar we felt good we had a good week of training to get back home we havent had a lot of results go our way in the last five games i dont think weve won we knew it was an important game everyone was healthy everyone was fit we knew today that we were going to have a good result
2844537 i feel like my legs are getting healthy and my legs are more fit the team as a whole i cant say too much for myself obviously it feels good to get a goal but just to have the team come together like we did today is a good enough feeling as it is
2844538 the most important thing for the team and for me is that we won they say that d c is very good on offense and i think the most important thing is that we are more confident after winning this game i think that we showed some good football
2844539 i thought i played well i tried to organize the defense speaking a lot i think the team needed this i felt good after playing the football we played i think we can play with any team we played on the ground to juan pablo angel and to jorge rojas they can make a difference every time we went inside we scored
2844540 i think it was important to get a result today first of all we couldnt get a grip of the game at the beginning in the first 15 minutes then they scored a goal that wasnt the best case scenario for us we didnt want to concede a goal early but it happened then we showed something that we havent showed earlier in the year we showed character and resilience we won a very difficult game against a decent side

2844546 politics takes precedence over sport with the iranians and the olympic spirit is as far from them as east is far from west
2844547 my heart goes out to the iranian athletes in the athens olympics one of their sportsmen who was a gold medal favorite had to pull out because he was drawn against an israeli
2844548 theres no place for this kind of behavior in the olympic movement and its a shame it continues

2844582 this fund is an excellent choice to anchor most investors bond portfolios especially those unwilling to take on substantial credit risk it boasts low expenses broad diversification and experienced management

2844598 it was the first score in our olympic campaign here at home and ill always remember it it represents that we can keep our heads up in the face of really tough odds
2844599 ultimately yao and the rest of china went down 101 70 to the team of nba superstars but not without winning praise for his gritty play and enthusiastic support for his teammates
2844600 he did a great job defensively at the beginning of the game eventually we wore down on him
2844601 for yao ming it was really a historical match so its really very significant for all of us
2844602 it would have been different without him not as special
2844603 its the start of something that can be great weve been waiting for years for this moment
2844604 so had the chinese which was what made this night so special they had yao and a proud country of 1 3 billion on their side and they were determined to at the very minimum put on a show for the home fans
2844605 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honor to play in it
2844606 no one else knows for sure either nielsen ratings havent gotten as far as china just yet but in a basketball mad country the estimates ranged to the hundreds of millions
2844607 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
2844608 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey
2844609 that name is usa and this team is now 1 0 with seven games to go to gain redemption for the failure of athens and win the gold medal next up is angola which will go quietly but it gets tougher after that with games against greece and spain

2844616 whatever happened is between me and shah rukh its personal im not going to deny that there are issues between us im a primitive man born in todays time i cant fake anything if there is a problem then im not going to deny it weve had problems before but this time i dont think we can sort them out we are two different people our values and way of thinking are different i dont think we can be friends i think its better to declare that then put on a fake fa ade of being friends and back biting each other
2844617 shah rukh used to come to my home to ask me to appear on kaun banega crorepati and om shanti om i just mentioned it to him that itll be nice if he has the time to listen to the story
2844618 yeah but ive only been to his house twice in my life the first time i went on my own and the second time was when he came and took me to his house for a chat its very simple if you come to my house and you are being nice to me so why wouldnt i be nice to you i dont fake anything if im not in a good mood then that too shows on screen but bad mood doesnt mean that ive to behave badly i try and be a good host
2844619 he akshay is very hard working and keeps to himself and will work hard to bring himself up and not to bring someone else down
2844620 god i talk to him all the time i always get my answers from him sure there have been instances when he doesnt listen to me and doesnt give me what i ask for but he does that only when i dont deserve it ive observed that whenever god hasnt given me what i asked for its for the best no matter what happens i always thank god agar yeh nahi bologe toh aap nashukr ho if you dont say this then youre thankless god has given me so much and i just have to appreciate it
2844621 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2844622 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2844623 im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2844624 we took him out and are just easing him back in
2844625 he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2844626 trust me it is true i dont get paid enough im running around from place to place to shoot and i dont have a clue about my schedules its hectic but fun
2844627 i dont think i need to comment about a relationship that never existed i have never spoken about my personal life and i dont think i need to justify about it to anybody
2844628 i have been approached by some hollywood filmmakers but i havent got something that has really excited me
2844629 wij hebben ze een mes in handen gegeven en nu eens kijken of ze dat mes ook gaan gebruiken
2844630 a little out at sea i jumped off with a tyre around my waist and they turned around to fetch one from our group who was still on the beach my mother does not know about this incident i did not know how to swim and in hindsight it was perhaps a stupid thing to do but when i saw the boat going back i felt really alone and at peace i turned my back on the beach and looked out at the vast sea that stretched in front it was as if i was one with nature the fact that i could not swim did not bother me
2844631 ive never done an ebay auction before so i didnt know what to expect but i am upset and frustrated after someone from bristol bid 10m and ive since found out she hasnt got that sort of money
2844632 ive spoken to ebay and the bid stands there are also bids for 9m on there from other people but if the 10m bid is won then that person wont be able to pay for the estate and the auction will have been a waste of time it feels like people have been scuppering my genuine auction
2844633 people putting false bids on ebay should not be allowed however i have had more than 400 emails over the weekend wishing me well for my cancer treatment and many of them saying they are interested in buying all or part of what has been advertised on ebay
2844634 we made a change just before the start of the race and went with a harder front tire
2844635 that allowed me to use the front a little bit more and conserve the rear
2844636 im getting closer all i can do at shannonville is what i did today
2844637 jordans a smart guy and he has a lot of experience but racing is racing and there are a lot of other good guys out there
2844638 we made a change to the bike this morning and it was really comfortable for me
2844639 but i wish i was healthier about 10 laps in i could feel the pain in every transition
2844640 i just didnt want to do anything stupid i never actually planned to be on the podium today
2844641 down the hall take a left and its on your right
2844642 the body of a chinese man was found lying on a bed in the rear bedroom of the property and the body of a chinese woman was found lying on a bed in the front bedroom northumbria police said
2844643 police including senior crime officers pathologists and other specialists are now working to establish the circumstances surrounding the deaths and are conducting forensic examinations
2844644 the pair had both suffered significant head injuries said a police spokesman
2844645 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more said ishaopeng wu 31 a member of the chinese students and scholars association
2844646 it is a tough area but convenient for the university sometimes local children attack us i dont know whether it is because we come from another country
2844647 the body of a chinese man was found lying on a bed in the rear bedroom of the property and the body of a chinese woman was found lying on a bed in the front bedroom northumbria police said
2844648 i havent seen anything like this in my whole life
2844649 we had nothing to eat we just had a bit of bread a bit of water
2844650 we have nothing to feed them we give the little bread we have to the elderly they need it most
2844651 at least for now the national goal of reducing oil use trumps any effect on food prices from making fuel from corn

2844656 were just winding down the never surrender tour right now but to be honest were just winding up weve had killer shows every night and several sell outs so far we just dont want this tour to end having recently signed to demolition dr2 records weve been celebrating every night and there is a really great vibe between the band and crew also to share stages with bullet for my valentine and kids in glass houses on this tour has been insane meeting up with old friends getting drunk and rocking out what more could we want
2844657 supporting firewind is an honour theyre a band we all admire so were really stepping things up for this tour our fans can look forward to new tracks and new tricks so watch out

2844666 we are thrilled that paul has committed to supporting our effort to bring hope and healing to the forgotten poor of the world
2844667 an endorsement from an athlete of his caliber is special as it not only brings visibility to our cause but he will help to serve as a great example of success through hard work and focus
2844668 the government of sudan tried to convince the people of darfur that the non muslims in the south were our enemies and used us to oppress the southerners
2844669 but now that we darfurians are the victims lopez and other southern sudanese are doing what they can to stand up for our people despite the fact that their family members were killed by soldiers from darfur
2844670 darfurians will help build the school for southerners and southerners will welcome darfurian muslims into the community and school not as enemies by as their brothers
2844671 as a muslim and a darfurian it grieves me that darfurians were sent to southern sudan to fight in the name of islam i know much of lopez lomongs suffering as a lost boy was caused by soldiers from darfur that he would stand up for darfurians is an example to all of sudan that darfurians and southern sudanese are brothers and we should not ever again be used as enemies of one another
2844672 handoff the only way to win the race of life
2844673 if you drop the baton in a relay race youll probably lose
2844674 but in life the race keeps going and the next generation is at an extreme disadvantage when they receive a weak pass i wrote handoff to let adults know that it is critical to make the effort to mentor young people and to encourage them that it is never too late to do so
2844675 we re rounding the last curve in the track the next generation glances our way hand outstretched poised to burst into the sprint of life will we make the pass civilization is at stake what will our generation s story be
2844676 handoff the only way to win the race of life
2844677 young people arent looking for perfection theyre looking for a model of persistence
2844678 dont pretend to be something youre not just set the pace for doing what is right and be real let your mess be your message
2844679 whether you are a believer or not no one is allowed to enter the church when president bush comes tomorrow where can we do our sunday service
2844680 president bush is coming to preach the gospel to those who dont believe in the lord referring to those police officers and officials we are already believers so we certainly dont have to come here tomorrow
2844681 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing china you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2844682 and i want to thank the pastor for his hospitality and i want to thank this beautiful choir for singing amazing grace and edelweiss it was a touching moment its been a joy to worship here again i want to thank you sir and god bless you god bless you

2844690 it wasnt just people signing the petition with their names it was people leaving comments and full paragraphs i had a physician saying he was the director of an er and wanted to get an iphone for everyone in his department
2844691 there are just a lot of passionate people out there who wanted to have medical programs on the iphone
2844692 we were really persistent and proactive to work with the record companies making them investors with imeem
2844693 no one has done that before in a legal way
2844694 in terms of the distribution they have a very positive platform
2844695 they have created their own network and can also attract other users from different social networking sites
2844696 imeem wont be a widely profitable model unless they have other ways to distribute their service
2844697 people came to imeem so quickly because they had the music they want but they can go other places as well
2844698 as the industry changes we are looking for more different models for growing bands
2844699 its really hard to get people to spend money on music but going to sites like imeem is a good way to learn about the band before you buy tickets
2844700 if they were promoting our artists and we would be giving them content it would make sense to have some kind of relationship with them
2844701 big brands are willing to pay higher rates to reach customers and ad rates are actually higher than people realize
2844702 over time as long as sites continue to provide value for advertisers the rates are going to be sustainable
2844703 our education field has failed to create national integrity and social harmony our education policies have produced extremists warriors and suicide bombers instead of intellectuals and scientists
2844704 role of textbooks in promoting social and inter religious harmony
2844705 followers of other religions are often busy in garrulous manners on their festivals
2844706 they do not express their relation or devotion with allah on the contrary on one hand these two festivals of islam provide an opportunity of entertainment and joy to muslims and on the other hand they become a source to meet one another and to help the needy
2844707 you know im tired of going through life without an education tomorrow i think ill go to the university of missouri and sign up for some classes
2844708 then logically speaking because you own a weedeater i think that you would have a yard
2844709 and because you have a house i think that you might logically have a family
2844710 and because you have a wife then logic tells me you must be a heterosexual
2844711 i am a heterosexual thats amazing you were able to find out all of that because i have a weedeater
2844712 its great working with an independent developer on a video for their software they take great pride in their product and great interest in what we do making our job much easier and very effective

2844760 i dont what were going to do were going to have to see where we can go and weve got to get kids registered for high school tomorrow hes got school so well see how it goes
2844761 it went really well and heaps of people came and we got lots of orders afterwards
2844762 each time i have a collection i will have a launch and a parade because i dont stock in any stores
2844763 its just made to order so thats how i show it to my clients i give them a parade and then they can try on stuff
2844764 i had a range of sizes in the gallery about three of every shirt with three different sizes so people could see the collection and try it on as close to their size as we had
2844765 there were also at least three fabrics for each design and within those fabrics two or three colours
2844766 donald is my home town and i always said if i had a label i would produce it in donald
2844767 this collection was inspired by shirts and the factory in donald is sort of casually called the shirt factory because they used to manufacture fairmark shirts thats basically where it came from the collection features a lot of buttons bows and features that you would find on a shirt but sort of twisted into a more feminine way
2844768 some drivers do not realise what could happen when they try to out run police
2844769 drivers put the occupants of the their cars and themselves at extreme risk and put other road users at extreme risk
2844770 at that time of night there is a number of people in the horsham area and you would also have to note the road conditions because of the rain
2844771 this could be the last time we run it out to fill natimuk but we are about to start to run in the north east of the region which will quite possibly be the last time for both of them
2844772 as the pipeline comes on we dont need to run the channels in those areas so if the construction of the pipeline continues at the same momentum it has been then its likely we wont have to run the channels again
2844773 natimuk will get its future water supply via supply system six of the wimmera mallee pipeline which is scheduled for completion by early 2010
2844774 because the natimuk storage was last filled in late 2006 the water picked up a few bits and pieces just things in the channel as it ran
2844775 each gram could be cut down up to 10 times depending on the manufacturer and sold for 180 250 a gram
2844776 we have fears they will continue to manufacture amphetamines in horsham and fear they are flight risk and will abscond bail
2844777 he wants to obtain bail deal with the matters and get back to his family and re establish a family life
2844778 its the only time the child has been away from her parents she is currently in the company of strangers
2844779 there is a need for us to look at the issues for the public good and what is in the best interests of the community
2844780 that was well received by the representatives there even though they were firm about their objections
2844781 the students in grades three to six at halls gap primary school feel a keen interest in and responsibility for agnes and her memory within the community as a result they are attempting to have the name of the peak officially renamed in reverence of agnes folkes and her family
2844782 it is the childrens belief that agnes is of greater importance to the area and community
2844783 we are not in a position to comment directly on that at this stage however there is a process for place name changes in victoria through the vicnames authority and parks victoria will be in contact with the school to help get all the right parties together
2844784 they obviously have an attachment to the site i would be very happy to work through a process to see whether it can or should be changed
2844785 i have been involved in some of those discussions and we looked at either side of the traditional date but the festival is something that is booked and organised 12 months in advance changing it would not be fair to the event or the volunteers and organisers who run it the success of the event hinges on it having a weekend of its own
2844786 hes gonna ask if we want to join his froum why would we when we have this one
2844787 actually kinakabahan ako kasi pag pasok ko palang sa imperial suites hotel i feel like im walking to the valley of death but probably its just on my mind
2844788 naging comfortable eventually magaling kasi si jun de leon eventually i became comfortable because jun de leon is a good photographer
2844789 dirt is brown and grass grows in dirt so obama is a muslim
2844790 obama punishes success demonizes companies especially oil companies for making money again sort of a segway but the profits of oil companies should be celebrated not chastied
2844791 this year graphika manilas lineup of speakers aims to inspire attendees on their presentations on print and graphic design motion graphics and animation visual effects production design ideas and inspiration freelancing techniques and a lot more
2844792 well maybe after 9 11 but as soon as that happened we were expecting a rush this came totally out of the blue its scary
2844793 they say on the tv that this has nothing to do with us but you just cant trust those russians
2844794 i remember when they invaded colorado in the eighties those reds theyre good for nothing you cant trust them no further than you can throw them
2844795 we have to be alert and aware at all times and our forces are ready to act at a moments notice i have the national guard on speed dial i can tell you i very nearly made that call today
2844796 cnn monitors all news stories we become aware of and report according to what we deem as relevant we have all the information anyone could need on the situation in georgia the country of georgia that is cnn is the world news leader
2844797 we were overwhelmed with calls for a while there and we are still getting a few said official drew ossington
2844798 we did contact washington and from what we were told the president was informed of the situation
2844799 i think its important for people to remain aware and alert
2844800 fear is a good thing it keeps us on edge and ready for anything this may have been a false alarm but the next one might not be im very happy that our residents are so proactive
2844801 for whatever the mind can conceive and believe the mind can achieve
2844802 i have been coaching advisors for over a decade and i know that advisors who spend the time to set goals and then focus their attention on the achievement of those goals consistently outperform those who dont have meaningful goals for their businesses
2844803 if georgia falls europes hopes of energy independence from russia fall too
2844804 was that it was the kindest friendliest most human version they had ever seen
2844805 the guy who came over to light his cigarette was crying he was swept away by the rest of the performance
2844806 a feeling of empathy between people who have nothing in common
2844807 thats really my definition of art arts only mission is to make people feel closer
2844808 the need for laughter and tears is so natural and so strong especially for people who live in dictatorships
2844809 their first need is the feeling of empathy to find someone with whom they can share their deeper feelings for those people maybe going and attending the tazieh can be a way of relating to these very deep emotions there is a natural tendency for laughing and crying in everyone but specifically in countries in which people are oppressed
2844810 he told me youre very lucky to live in a country where there is still such innocence
2844811 i said the day that you show all my films you can also show this you cant just choose this because you consider it something religious you can use in a different way
2844812 its been getting worse and worse none of my films have been shown for the past 10 years in iran and this is not just about me its not that they have a problem with what i do its that more generally they cannot accept independent films
2844813 i am very lucky to be part of the team that is helping to continue the r evol ution here in nevada i am proud to say that we have sound constitutional candidates running in each of nevadas three congressional districts
2844814 ew gabe and any other gop member you better get used to following the rules to the letter there is a new brand of republican in this state and these republicans want to follow the rules that are in place and make others follow them as well
2844815 the corruption that i personally saw at the state convention makes me sick
2844816 the true conservatives are back in charge of nv gop and we are here to stay for a long time to come the message of true republicans will make our party grow so we can fight off the growth of the dems and their socialist agendas that will destroy this country and this state
2844817 a warning to all current gop members in nv if you are involved in any fraud and or corruption at any level quit now principles and truth are going to be the new brand of the nv gop a note for sue lowden hiding information from party members is corruption
2844818 i choose to stop voting for the lesser of two evils after the 2004 general election
2844819 but carl if you had voted or read the newspaper or even taken a moment to watch the local news youd know we already have a republican congressman
2844820 the evidence shows that the overwhelming majority of victims are women and abusers men taking action against domestic violence is therefore included as part of the cps violence against women strategy
2844821 there once was an old rancher who got bored and decided the best way to pass the time was to cross australia on his little ctx200
2844822 i was using the ctx regularly on my land but just found that i needed some extra room to carry tools and the like so one day i just welded up and fitted the sidecar and its never missed a beat since
2844823 this has definitely been one of my more fascinating journeys
2844824 i met aboriginal elders survived a cyclone as well as heat of up to 55 celsius and still managed to finish five weeks earlier than i had first planned
2844825 i only had about 30 cms of water underneath me the whole time but it certainly was a fantastic experience
2844826 there was a lot of sand dirt mud and grit from the river bottom which had the potential to destroy any rubber impellers and those are necessary to keep the motor from getting hot and seizing up
2844827 the honda was my preferred choice because it is renowned for long term reliability and as a seasoned traveller using honda products i knew it would be up to the task
2844828 the motor is environmental friendly being that it is a 4 stroke engine and will not pollute the water with any oil contaminants importantly it is also air cooled and very fuel efficient which gives a great advantage it is quiet and does not contribute to noise pollution
2844829 considering i was carrying 600kgs plus the weight of the two canoes it is real testament to the honda product no one else has achieved this river journey in these conditions
2844830 all over the world people have been saying that our country is the center of marine biodiversity this is the time to be proud and show the world what we have
2844831 we are largely an educational facility as much as possible we want to promote the conservation and preservation of marine species
2844832 to send a clear signal to china we should stop buying their cheap exports and buy british instead
2844833 fewer than 1 in 10 advisors spend more than 60 of their time in front of clients those who do realize annual net incomes that are more than 3 times those who spend only 30 60 of their time with clients
2844834 the most satisfied clients averaged 28 contacts in person by telephone by mail and by email with their advisors in a one year period dissatisfied clients on the other hand averaged only 17 contacts over the same period
2844835 both sides would enhance information exchanges on infectious diseases and cooperation on prevention and control of public health emergencies
2844836 what comes first transitioning my business to 1qa or from solo to ensemble
2844837 for many people whose hopes and dreams are based on entrepreneurial risk taking this will be a wonderful time to be alive it will be the greatest period of entrepreneurial opportunity in history it will be a time filled with excitement creativity success and satisfaction
2844838 the iraqi navy and coalition naval forces partner in critically important maritime missions which includes maintaining security and stability in iraqs territorial waters monitoring maritime traffic protecting commercial shipping into and out of iraqs ports and protecting iraqs coastline and infrastructure from any potential threats
2844839 iraqs two main offshore oil terminals are located in iraqi territorial waters out at sea about 19 miles from the iraqi coast
2844840 it is a mission that adm jawad and his sailors and marines take very seriously and are executing with great professionalism
2844841 great ability to lead and his professionalism in building the capacity of the iraqi navy that is now protecting iraqis vital interests
2844842 one ring to rule them all one ring to bind them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness find them
2844843 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
2844844 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
2844845 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
2844846 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
2844847 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
2844848 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
2844849 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
2844850 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
2844851 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him
2844852 depth variety and regular posts and a bit of politics too
2844853 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
2844854 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
2844855 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
2844856 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
2844857 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
2844858 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject
2844859 for the fact that he is in public office and combines council business and interesting outlooks generally
2844860 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
2844861 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
2844862 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
2844863 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
2844864 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
2844865 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
2844866 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
2844867 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective
2844868 where language literature and politics intersect some thoughtful musings on identity in relation to northern ireland from an irish ex pat
2844869 a tyrone ex pats whimsical blog where politics is viewed through the filters of sport travel identity and more recently fiction
2844870 a new collaborative venture by a number of bloggers braodly on the left it deals in political social and cultural issues as well as some humour
2844871 possibly the most impressive blog there are serious and thoughtful pieces virtually every day on a huge range of topics
2844872 serving up an interesting mix of investigative journalism and local interest
2844873 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute
2844874 the ira have clearly gone off the stage and have done so since 2005 but theres still attempts being made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly
2844875 if were trying to build a normal modern democratic european society there is no excuse for holding onto weapons and ive already started that debate
2844876 i have asked that they produce an ad hoc report clarifying its assessment of the completion of the transformation of pira as set out in its 18th report
2844877 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
2844878 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
2844879 the use of the word theory can mislead those not familiar with science
2844880 this is due to an increased disillusionment with current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification it is not just solely about policing i am disillusioned with the current political strategy
2844881 the future of dc tech depends on your answers to this survey
2844882 good friends are hard to find harder to leave and impossible to forget
2844883 were focusing on the health and welfare of the guests involved in this tragic accident we have established the following number 800 946 4946 to provide information and assistance to family members of those involved in the accident
2844884 there is still interest in takeo like i have been saying all along
2844885 it is going to be one of the strongest linebacking corps in the middle with him and patrick
2844886 as far as football goes he is just a leader he has got that quality about him
2844887 he knows his stuff he pays attention to his film study and he is prepared he is the type of guy you need on a defence
2844888 i would say about a 6 i need to work on my muscle tone before my number can be higher
2844889 unfortunately i am about a 3 gained 8 pounds in two weeks
2844890 id say 2 i could lose a few pounds i have a scar from burning myself when i was little and my parents never got me braces for my teeth
2844891 what would we say about these individuals why arent they easier on themselves
2844892 my goal is to have six of them a couple up here and a couple downtown including river front tours and washington park tours and im working with the aqua ducks and hes hoping to maybe compliment this as part of their tours
2844893 wacky hermits organic babies are even tastier than the puppies i put in my smoothies
2844894 we have trophies based on the generation for example the 50s 60s 70s but we also have special awards for peoples choice where you or anyone of the public can vote on their favorite corvette the one that strikes them the most
2844895 first payment date is invalid payments should begin before the age of 85 january 1 2045
2844896 to obtain a quote for this dollar amount please contact vanguard at 800 522 5555
2844897 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2844898 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2844899 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2844900 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2844901 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles
2844902 the notion that compared with their large and mid cap counterparts small cap active equity managers are more likely to outperform their market segment
2844903 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
2844904 hopefully we got the craziness out of the way and the regatta will proceed smoothly from now on
2844905 bishops from around the anglican communion to discover the deeper realities of the
2844906 frankly its boom blox original design was all about the control of the wii wand but there are other ways to implement that
2844907 i expect youll see it on other platforms in time
2844908 notion of that controller is a non trivial point that youve brought up that control and that familiarity is like comfort food from my perspective we lead we dont follow
2844909 as a brand nintendos got their thing and were not trying to get the senior citizen group to get into gaming were looking to convert the ps2 owners and the tens of millions of installed base that were playing dvds and playing games on their ps2 to now play blu ray movies and blu ray games with their ps3
2844910 it was more like 114 minutes i was on a long phone call with the big boss trying to get you users some better facilities
2844911 um i need to know how to rename a file
2844912 the arcbs fails to note that the surveys it cites to back up these statements have samples which are drawn from
2844913 ive wanted to donate blood since the ban was implemented in the 1980s however i accept the red cross decision is for the greater good no doubt id feel great about myself through the selfless act of giving blood but its even more selfless to accept that under the circumstances i cant
2844914 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2844915 ah one of lawrence sanders archy mcnally books i havent read
2844916 morgans 25th century earth is convincing while the questions he poses about how much self is tied to body chemistry and how the rich believe themselves above the law are especially timely
2844917 everyone has to have a counter to the spread offenses
2844918 what you cant do is come out and play with a bunch of big linebackers against all these teams spreading the field all the time
2844919 its a three safety package that kind of is a counter to not having to change personnel every time a team comes out there and spreads you out what youre trying to do is match athleticism with athleticism
2844920 for the most part unless im running into a big lineman
2844921 the big difference is raeshon has a significant level of experience
2844922 both have very good athleticism both have very good coverage skills the one thing is whe gary is running on the show team last year and cant hit anybody all you see him do is cover
2844923 also if youre on the show team if somebody runs by you its not like 80 000 people are in the stands oh well gave up a touchdown well theres no oh wells anymore if somebody runs by you now it counts raeshon has had to do it for real gary hasnt yet the first thing gary has to do get used to playing again where it counts
2844924 has a personal health issue and has had to put the deal on hold
2844925 its hard when everyone says i should be kicking and the coaches game plan is just letting dan kick
2844926 im working on it im practicing my kicking personally i just have to apply it to the game really its like anything when you are trying to add a lot of strings to your game eventually you just have to do it in the game
2844927 i hear a lot of stuff out there its really hard to take at times
2844928 we dont really get that time and space in dunedin we didnt get any lineouts to work off and they are physical at the breakdown someone like schalk burger fires up out of the line and tries to smash everyone its hard
2844929 we just have to adapt to what is going to happen we arent always going to get clean ball and good lineouts so we have to find a way to look for other stuff as well
2844930 but their line speed is pretty you can see how butch james defends and hes a good tackler
2844931 we have just got to look after our ball that is going to be crucial
2844932 they always try to pinpoint who is the best ball runner in the opposition and try and flog them they try to get them mentally as well as physically
2844933 i dropped a few balls in sydney there were a few errors in sydney as a team i had to lift my game in auckland for the team and the coaches really i was pretty stoked that i didnt make a mistake or drop a ball
2844934 i was really concentrating its about doing one job at a time rather than thinking about making a break or making a gap for someone
2844935 were not through yet but weve taken a break mr mugabe said as he left the talks overnight at a harare hotel being mediated by south african president thabo mbeki
2844936 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2844937 were not through yet but weve taken a break mr mugabe said as he left the talks overnight at a harare hotel being mediated by south african president thabo mbeki
2844938 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2844939 it is going to be a long day so i just have to stay patient
2844940 i am going to relax and get off my feet and get a little rub down
2844941 i am four behind at the moment and i would take that as long as there are not 20 guys between me and three under
2844942 as long as there are not too many bodies ahead of you you can make up quite a big amount in the last round of a major
2844943 going into this game we will be the underdogs weve seen that home turf counts for a lot in this competition and they the springboks have a great record in south africa
2844944 yes and no its good in that everyone gets the opportunity to rest up but not so because you lose momentum
2844945 they have had rugby and game time and thats an advantage
2844946 the key thing for us is we prepare in a genuine fashion if your preparation is honest and bone deep then you are going to be ready
2844947 they played pretty well after a rusty first 30 minutes and dominated the pumas and scored some wonderful tries
2844948 but their game hasnt changed much its easier to get up for south africa than australia because you know its such a huge physical challenge
2844949 thats not to say the wallabies are not physical you saw what they did to us in sydney but sometimes with australia you can tend to think you are expected do the job in the forwards and you struggle
2844950 lo siento mucho son las 3 me voy a comer y a echar la siesta
2844951 the dogs were with a male and by the time we got there the dogs and the male had disappeared
2844952 that depends on the dog were the dogs scared do the dogs have a past history it could result in a fine for the owner or as drastic a step as having the dog put down
2844953 an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of all forces to the status quo
2844954 russia must affirm that its aim is not to change the democratically elected government of georgia and that it accepts that territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
2844955 to bring up publicly the idea of president mikheil saakashvili stepping down may be an interesting signal
2844956 sometimes there are democratic leaders who do things which create great problems for their country
2844957 sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2844958 could not allow georgian attacks on civilians and russian peacekeepers
2844959 this is completely unacceptable especially from the lips of a representative of a country whose actions we are aware of in iraq afghanistan and serbia
2844960 inside georgia according to first estimates it is more than 10 000
2844961 the australian chamber of commerce and industry and the business council of australia have called for greater emphasis to be placed on what theyre calling employability skills and they are things like communication problem solving planning and organising teamwork developing skills for life
2844962 what were hoping for today is to start a conversation nationally about what we should expect every student to achieve what are the basics how can we set minimum expectations for all students
2844963 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2844964 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2844965 the real breakthrough here is that were no longer required to use animal products which sometimes contain viruses that we cant detect
2844966 if thaksin really doesnt come back the conflict in our country will lessen which implies that our prolonged political trouble will come to an end soon
2844967 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
2844968 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds
2844969 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
2844970 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2844971 there is a name every day that is the nature of the business
2844972 i cant answer it because ive not got a direct answer
2844973 its possible we could sign someone this week we are trying weve got one or two options we are looking at and hopefully we can get something done before the start of the season
2844974 it has been pressing since the end of last season we like to operate with four strikers and we have not been able to do that
2844975 rio is now the best centre half in the world by far
2844976 that was an exemplary performance he did not give one foul away and intercepted every ball that came towards him
2844977 he broke out of defence in comfort so many times it was unbelievable he is a magnificent player
2844978 he is 30 now and because he has experience his potential is now being fulfilled in a big way
2844979 i was down and he stamped on me i thought he could have avoided me there was no need for it that was why i reacted and why i grabbed his leg
2844980 we came here with just 18 players and we know we are going to need a bigger squad because of the extra demands on the uefa cup which is new ground for us

2844982 conduct awareness through schools existing conservation groups youth groups community groups churches and sporting clubs
2844983 americans while occasionally willing to be serfs have always been obstinate about being peasantry
2844984 you californians have all hat and no cattle everyone goes around pretending to own things with money they dont make
2844985 everyone is trying to get in now on a three year lease hoping that chrysler financial will get back in the game by the time their lease is done
2844986 trade up because it will always go up in value
2844987 the latest casualties in the so called casual dining sector considered a cut above fast food
2844988 but the franchisees now find themselves owning a brand with no corporate cousins
2844989 we associate the newsboy look with urban poverty street kids of the 1930s
2844990 given that were in an unstable economy and an uncertain political landscape its possible that a retro style has come back as a way to connect with our heritage
2844991 stealing from the rich is a moral duty not a crime
2844992 really one night der wuz a real bad storm an da dragon got struck by lightning right in da head we heard him thumping around outside da main tower

2844999 four days later i got the operation a double bypass
2845000 i couldnt even pick up an empty cardboard box without getting out of breath i decided i needed something aerobics was boring
2845001 here i was an old guy and theres my instructor with a shaven head and three earrings
2845002 he doesnt get any special treatment nor would he accept special treatment
2845003 i think everyone looks at him as a great inspiration in the school as do i
2845004 he has a seniors class and im in his seniors class he even gets mad at me because i dont practice enough
2845005 i think with the number of home invasions that fear that society has placed on seniors this gives us the opportunity to fight back
2845006 its ugly and excessive a slap in the face to roman citizens if it was up to me id demolish it completely but because we havent got the money this is not possible
2845007 if attention is not paid there is the possibility they will be destroyed
2845008 floods and rain in spring and snow in winter all end up around the minarets
2845009 later now go on and while i clean up the kitchen
2845010 the problem in the past has been the expense of geothermal energy generation
2845011 business leaders are increasingly finding that theyre at the sharp end of the credit crunch and need to take stock of how they run their organisations in order to get the best from their employees
2845012 in these tough financial times employers are facing a difficult challenge to keep their staff motivated with many trying to find low cost incentives to encourage and reward productivity
2845013 by the time i was in he was out and he counterpunched
2845014 if you can keep your head when everyone is losing theirs
2845015 the third step for a de escalation would be the withdrawal of all troops on both sides but a withdrawal accompanied by observers

2845022 the weakened us dollar translates to savings from expenditure incurred abroad which can be fairly hefty for bigger families
2845023 respect for the rules and the sovereign will of the people is above personal interests
2845024 the results have to be respected and allow for a new political scene
2845025 the best of times it was the worst of times
2845026 i felt this thrill going up my leg i dont have that too often
2845027 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could save just as much
2845028 senator obama opposes off shore drilling he opposes reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel he opposes storage of spent nuclear fuel so he is dr no of americas energy future
2845029 there is an abundant supply of oil resources in the view of the people who are in the business that could be exploited in a matter of months we all know that the comprehensive solution is wind tide solar all of the things that all of us believe in but it also means offshore drilling and it also means nuclear power and it also means clean coal technology in the meantime as we develop all of these alternate sources of energy it will be vital that we continue oil production at a high level including off shore drilling
2845030 n s nos comportamos bem no primeiro tempo mas n o conseguimos aumentar a vantagem
2845031 n s nos comportamos bem no primeiro tempo mas n o conseguimos aumentar a vantagem no segundo tempo infelizmente levamos os dois gols temos de trabalhar durante a semana para pensar no atl tico mg
2845032 est vamos bem no jogo mas no segundo tempo o time deles veio para cima com um jogador a mais era um jogo de seis pontos que poderia nos deixar mais perto da sa da da zona do rebaixamento mas n s perdemos
2845033 dif cil porque jogar com um a menos complicado o fluminense tentou jogar forte desde o come o mas infelizmente n o conseguimos segurar o resultado

2845039 the hot and humid weather of the past few days is unlikely to occur
2845040 the sports leadership grants for women program is one important way the government is addressing the under representation of women in sport
2845041 these grants will enable more women to undertake accredited sports leadership training in areas where they traditionally tend to be under represented
2845042 for example a grant to the lakemba sports and recreation club in sydney will help the club train 60 women in a soccer coaching course significantly all the women are from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds where sport is not a traditional pathway for women
2845043 many of the successful grant recipients are role models in their communities or sporting clubs
2845044 australian sport stands to benefit from having a greater number of women in leadership and decision making roles it contributes to the depth and diversity of australian sport
2845045 the women leaders in sport that we provide assistance to today will in turn help to coach and develop the future generations of australian olympians who will possibly compete for gold in the 2020 and 2024 olympics and beyond
2845046 we call for an immediate halt to the hostilities and strongly urge all parties involved to display restraint in words and deeds and to respect national boundaries
2845047 these peoples see their history as inextricably bound up with the fountainhead of slavic civilization represented by the kremlin
2845048 russia in turn has given them limited diplomatic political and military support in their respective struggles for self determination and kept the georgian wolf at the door however saakashvili in his bid to create a greater georgia and prove his usefulness to the anti russian alliance of nato nations is taking the offensive even as he jails the opposition cracks down on the media and seeks to label anyone who fails to march in lockstep to his authoritarianism a russian spy georgia creeps closer to full nato membership first ukraine then georgia the creation of a cordon sanitaire around the former soviet union requires just a few more links
2845049 we should not forget that 90 of the population of abkhazia and south ossetia are russian citizens
2845050 millions of people opted for russian citizenship that was their right and prerogative
2845051 washingtons policy over the past 15 years has been to support ethno separatist movements much like the one in south ossetia the best example being our military campaign on behalf of the kla culminating in george bushs official recognition of the islamo mafia cesspool known as kosovo spain notably didnt follow bush in legitimizing kosovo as it worried that this might encourage basque separatists within its own borders i wonder if president saakashvili is wondering whether the incoherent foreign policy of his american patron might have done much to inspire the south ossetia rebels who are now such a pain in his side
2845052 moscow has argued that what the west considers acceptable in kosovo or montenegro namely the right of self determination should be equally acceptable to trans dneister abkhazia or south ossetia the breakaway regions of moldova and georgia
2845053 the construction of an oil pipeline that somehow avoids traversing russian territory is the dearest dream of the chevron wing of the republican party and would please to no end the clintonian democrats who youll remember set up a special office of the us government devoted to making that pipeline a reality
2845054 in the geopolitics of energy security nothing like this has happened before the united states has suffered a huge defeat in the race for caspian gas the question now is how much longer washington could afford to keep iran out of the energy market
2845055 what is being decided here is whether bordering russia and simultaneously being a us ally is a suicidal combination whichever way this works out the dynamics of the entire region are about to be turned on their head
2845056 secrecy self reliance and a well stocked cabinet full of hefty bags
2845057 the morality of work is the morality of slaves and the modern world has no need of slavery
2845058 this is the morality of the slave state applied in circumstances totally unlike those in which it arose no wonder the result has been disastrous let us take an illustration suppose that at a given moment a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins they make as many pins as the world needs working say eight hours a day someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price in a sensible world everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight and everything else would go on as before but in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing the men still work eight hours there are too many pins some employers go bankrupt and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work there is in the end just as much leisure as on the other plan but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked in this way it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness can anything more insane be imagined
2845059 dont waste your credits we better go off now bye

2845069 communities are terrorized by ice immigration and customs enforcement immigration raids
2845070 on behalf of the 26 000 members of the federal law enforcement officers association fleoa i take great exception to your disparaging remark communities are terrorized by ice immigration raids
2845071 while the dedicated men and women of ice endeavor to carry out their dangerous and noble missions you somehow felt compelled to characterize their efforts as something akin to terrorizing
2845072 its one thing to remark intelligently on the need for immigration reform but its quite another to berate ice law enforcement officers who are risking their lives to enforce the laws passed by congress
2845073 your bi partisan fumble should not translate into labeling our members as terrorists by implication
2845074 ice employs patriotic men and women who are outstanding law enforcement officers not rampaging home wreckers
2845075 that those carrying the ice shield are heroes and not terrorists
2845076 i was banned for no reason no warning no nothing does the site owner know about this
2845077 i was banned for no reason no warning no nothing does the site owner know about this
2845078 as far moses on mount sinai is concerned it was either a supernatural cosmic event which i dont believe or a legend which i dont believe either or finally and this is very probable an event that joined moses and the people of israel under the effect of narcotics
2845079 the bible says people see sounds and that is a classic phenomenon
2845080 family members believe it is a medical condition that might have led to his death mr hayes was being treated for a number of medical issues
2845081 keep on charging the enemy so long as there is life
2845082 i admit after page 400 the be learning curve takes a sharp upward turn
2845083 in brightest day in blackest night no evil shall escape my sight let those who worship evils might beware my power green lanterns light
2845084 and by the time i made the decision to transition my gender dissonance had gotten so bad that it completely consumed me it hurt more than any pain physical or emotional that i had ever experienced when i made the decision to transition i honestly had no idea what it would be like for me to live as female the only thing i knew for sure was that pretending to be male was slowly killing me
2845085 crowley having nightmares of tumbling from the face rattling his body like the bars of a cage
2845086 no one understood why i didnt feel at fault but id only introduced you to the glory of mountaintops
2845087 why were you so obsessed with this now youre free to give back all the time you wasted out on the seven summits
2845088 when you let it go its actually quite nice the shivering subsides and everything feels fine you will meet your wife and kids so you can say goodbye to everything you knew

2845092 were not just talking one or two bottles but 200 300 human waste filled containers along a 25 mile stretch of the freeway between ontario and huntington police think long haul truck drivers might be to blame
2845093 este es un tema que conversaremos en su oportunidad l jayo nos dijo que no se sent a c modo por la situaci n que pasaba en alianza pero vamos a esperar porque tiene contrato con g lvez y lo importante es que era un asunto importante de l tendremos que conversar al respecto con el profesor p ez y el tema econ mico no ser a un problema a m lo que me parece correcto es salir de este mal momento esta situaci n es lamentable y hay que solucionarla con todo lo que se pueda
2845094 ese tema lo he conversado y en las pr ximas horas hablaremos al respecto
2845095 lo de jayo ha sido una situaci n fuera de lo l gico es un jugador representativo del f tbol peruano y alianza lima que sali por un acto de indisciplina que se hizo p blico y sufri las consecuencias de este acto siendo separado del plantel por razones bien obvias hoy est con una situaci n conformada por la misma necesidad que tienen tanto jayo de regresar como alianza lima de rescatar un jugador de su carisma y liderazgo
2845096 la tercera fase ser a una retirada de las tropas de ambos bandos pero una retirada acompa ada por observadores internacionales

2845098 pese a las provocaciones permanentes el comportamiento de pueblo boliviano ha sido totalmente exitoso hoy domingo en este referendo revocatorio en bolivia
2845099 la lectura preliminar del referendo es que se va a profundizar much simo m s la crisis pol tica y la tensi n en el pa s
2845100 si bien el presidente ha obtenido una votaci n alta los prefectos que son adversos al gobierno logran una votaci n que legitima sus posiciones y los fortalece
2845101 si l no quiere salir por las buenas entonces tendremos que sacarle a las malas y eso quiere decir sacarle a patadas a este prefecto
2845102 hoy admitimos estos resultados preliminares porque son contundentes pero me preocupa mucho la unidad nacional veo todav a un pa s muy confrontado
2845103 if they had a contractor buddy who needed to get rid of cement theyd say bring it on here
2845104 said suzanne goode a senior environmental scientist with the california department of parks and recreation
2845105 those that show up are faced with barriers and bad habitat
2845106 quite often they cannot get back downstream and theyll be trapped in pools that start to dry out
2845107 theyre actually the first ones that evolved and they are able to tolerate the warmer waters that we have in southern california
2845108 this is really significant because of climate change the fish up north cannot tolerate the warm waters so as northern streams become warmer we may hold the key to having steelhead trout
2845109 fish show up in places they havent been in years as soon as you give them a place to come
2845110 theres exotic grasses crab grass fruit trees it looks sort of like peoples backyards
2845111 then you have dry creek bed for thousands of feet that has these arundos growing on both sides instead of the willows that it should have
2845112 the problem in the past has been the expense of geothermal energy generation
2845113 the pipes affect the migration of wild animals and where we can graze our cattle
2845114 now they are drilling wells on either side of our valley it scares off the animals also the vegetation has changed
2845115 the huge benefits of course are that you are getting indigenous electricity which doesnt rely on expensive oil imports
2845116 the other benefit is that you dont get any co2 emissions
2845117 we have intensified exploration of geothermal resources because we want to find a way to bring the cost of power down and hopefully bring in investors by 2030 at least 80 percent of kenyans will have power
2845118 you just have to take it on and give it a go
2845119 when i started making putts i just stuck in there and it brought my game up the more i got into it the better i played
2845120 i was comfortable with my game in winning the open this week i havent been as confident and comfortable but i knew i had the ability to win if i got a chance
2845121 apparently came from coleman natural beef whose nebraska beef processing plant was previously subject to a nationwide recall for e coli 0157 h7 contamination
2845122 assurances from coleman natural beef that no product delivered to whole foods market was linked to the previous recall
2845123 based on the statements by family members that mr hayes had been treated of late for a number of medical issues we believe that led to his death today there are no plans for an autopsy
2845124 when i finished the house was on its feet man and i was a hit so i started pursuing music big time
2845125 at the end of the day we are responsible for our own lives
2845126 if anything happens to us dont blame somebody else backtrack and look at what you did to contribute to that you also contribute to your successes once you learn that youre on your way
2845127 vamos a plantear que se modifiquen procedimientos de los procesos en tica que si se trata de salvaguardar el honor de congresistas que la investigaci n que realiza siga siendo de car cter reservada pero cuando la comisi n de tica hace una propuesta de sanci n al pleno sta sea p blica
2845128 se va plantear que stas sesiones en el pleno sean p blicas y que cada bancada asuma su responsabilidad
2845129 lo que pasa es que ha habido especulaciones con relaci n al ltimo proceso electoral interno de la mesa directiva del congreso
2845130 el pa s ha expresado que las dos visiones tienen que ser compatibilizadas creo que lo mas importante es impulsar el dialogo y no seguir intentando desconocerse una a la otra
2845131 la lectura preliminar del referendo es que se va a profundizar much simo m s la crisis pol tica y la tensi n en el pa s
2845132 si bien el presidente ha obtenido una votaci n alta los prefectos que son adversos al gobierno logran una votaci n que legitima sus posiciones y los fortalece
2845133 es un perfeccionamiento del resultado del comicio general del 2005
2845134 estoy en atenas he venido a ver todos los papeles del contrato y reci n el martes me estar n presentando
2845135 fue de lo mejor el recibimiento del presidente del club y un poco que me sorprendi que llegaron unos diez hinchas del equipo al aeropuerto a darme la bienvenida y la verdad que me siento bien hay expectativa por empezar una liga para m que es desconocida pero ya tengo la experiencia del caso
2845136 washington leads the nation in accountability with some of the most rigorous academic standards in the u s
2845137 el partido aprista tiene una gran capacidad de copamiento del estado porque es fuerte pero en este gobierno la peculiaridad es que garc a tiene la capacidad de nombrar ministros y viceministros algo que en su primer periodo se lo impuso el apra pero en la pol tica de clientela su agrupaci n sigue teniendo mucha capacidad por ser un partido grande y organizado
2845138 y por eso necesitan a alguien ah arana cumple esa funci n
2845139 necesitan operadores eficaces y parece que el se or arana es el que trabaja mucho la cuesti n organizativa y las campa as no tienen cuadros tan eficaces como l y por eso insisten siempre en colocarlos en estos cargos no creo que sea otra la raz n no es un cuadro t cnico calificado parece que es un ingeniero simplemente que no conoce mucho de las pol ticas sociales
2845140 all the gold that leaves our village is headed to mali to this one man
2845141 he has the means to take it out we dont
2845142 for a long time hes worked with the white people
2845143 we dont live in the bush so we have nothing to do with child labor
2845144 i can assure you that what he declares is only a fraction of what is going out
2845145 if i am wrong you can cut off my head and put it on a platter
2845146 i buy some grams some kilos from here and there
2845147 service or even accept gold from a mine where children work
2845148 it comes from africa and it arrives in the swiss banks thats all you need to know
2845149 there is a desire to deal with this but the question is how
2845150 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
2845151 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
2845152 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
2845153 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold
2845154 i cant wait i just want to go out and have fun
2845155 lets not irritate the physicians or else theyre going to take their patients to another hospital
2845156 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2845157 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2845158 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2845159 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2845160 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one
2845161 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2845162 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2845163 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2845164 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2845165 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run
2845166 now it seems as if he is in another world
2845167 the hardest things that there isnt any connection between me and my child
2845168 when i told him to talk to me he doesnt have any response
2845169 i see him grow up in front of my eyes
2845170 in order to recognize his state and in order to learn me how to practice with him
2845171 who will take care of him if i die for example
2845172 maybe i go in the street out there and a bomb in my way and ill die especially in these situations so who would take care of him in his situation who would take care of him
2845173 11 6 45 8 4 82 8 6 82 trilogy

2845179 presenten durante el transcurso de la semana una propuesta salarial en torno a nuestro pedido
2845180 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
2845181 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
2845182 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2845183 its very unjust never once did i attempt to thrust atheism on these children i was scrupulously careful not to do that i was simply trying to persuade them to look at the evidence it was a pro evolution point rather than an anti religious point
2845184 i do get a bit exasperated at people hearing what they expect me to say rather than what i do say
2845185 perhaps the most powerful idea ever to occur to a human mind
2845186 we find no vestige of a beginning no prospect of an end
2845187 if you actually look at the god delusion including those bits people think are strident and shrill and so on i like to think theyre actually funny
2845188 a petty unjust unforgiving control freak a vindictive bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser a misogynistic homophobic
2845189 its a bit like the dilemma of a doctor who has a patient who has terminal cancer and the doctor has to decide whether to tell the truth or regard the patients private consolation as outweighing the truth if i were talking to an individual who had recently been bereaved i probably would hold my tongue in a way that i dont for anybody who chooses to read the book
2845190 you cant appreciate english literature for a start unless youre pretty knowledgeable about the bible if you dont understand what it means when someone alludes to
2845191 just glorious and its not just the music the drama of the passion of jesus as a work of fiction is something you can lose yourself in just as one can reading a novel you dont have to believe that heathcliff and cathy really existed to get caught up in the emotion
2845192 but if your main object is to understand how the universe works the question of whether or not theres a god in the universe is profoundly important
2845193 so i wouldnt wish to muzzle myself or anybody else for the sake of a skirmish in american schools about evolution
2845194 when he said no she apologized and assured him that she would find him later
2845195 daddy only gave me four dollars because my summer day camp went to mcdonalds after we left build a bear and i always get a cheeseburger and a sierra mist because daddy says coke makes me crazy and one time on spongebob patrick didnt take spongebob to the doctor when he had the suds and then oooh look a butterfly
2845196 excessive caloric expenditure has limited implications for substantially reducing body weight independent of nutritional modifications
2845197 we get a tremendous amount of pressure to eat for reasons other than nurturing ourselves and over time people lose sensitivity to hunger fullness appetite signals meant to keep them healthy and well nourished its hard for people to come to a healthy sense of themselves given the cultural climate and nutritious and pleasurable options for healthy food are not as easily accessible as less nutritious
2845198 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a home wrecker
2845199 as far as steffan transferring to the university of idaho i would hope so
2845200 hes going through a situation where hes trying to figure out what hes going to do next has there been conversations between steffan and us yes but theres nothing official yet
2845201 theres nothing going on in the legal aspect of it
2845202 its just like every kid that we recruit and will recruit during my time at the university of idaho weve checked his legal background and he doesnt have a record from what ive found out and pacific is not able to comment too much on it theres nothing there
2845203 i definitely feel like my name has been hurt but people know what type of person i am
2845204 thats why im not trippin about trying to plead my case i have a lot of fans and they know me they already know what the deal is i really dont care what the outsiders think
2845205 if it was forcible rape do you think i would be at this school
2845206 do you think they would want me to come back
2845207 although personally i am quite content with existing explosives i feel we must not stand in the path of improvement
2845208 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2845209 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2845210 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2845211 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2845212 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2845213 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2845214 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2845215 twelve small problems that happen in just the right order
2845216 one should ask which came first the propane facility or the suburban develoment
2845217 we now represent a really candid cross section of what america is
2845218 i think many of our problems as a country would be solved if people had thick passports
2845219 theres just no substitute for actually going and seeing things
2845220 you start to feel a level of responsibility to direct attention to things that actually matter more than to silly things like who youre dating
2845221 for a lot of actors our biggest fear is that were going to start talking about things we dont fully understand and sound like idiots
2845222 in the long run ill do much more good if when i open my mouth i have something worth saying
2845223 i realized that because of president bush s malaria initiative this baby had survived
2845224 when you go to a country and see your fellow americans feeding people or getting clean water or saving their lives you are really seeing the best of us we are exporting the best of who we are and who we should be
2845225 i remembered as a kid sitting with ben affleck dreaming of someday going to new york and becoming actors
2845226 for a lot of actors our biggest fear is that were going to start talking about things we dont fully understand and sound like idiots
2845227 this is a replacement for a lost or stolen passport
2845228 this girl is a fucking idiot and this passport must be stapled to her forehead
2845229 this is a replacement for a lost or stolen passport
2845230 this girl is a fucking idiot and this passport must be stapled to her forehead
2845231 this is a replacement for a lost or stolen passport
2845232 this girl is a fucking idiot and this passport must be stapled to her forehead
2845233 one of the most purely entertaining hamlets i have ever seen
2845234 the doctor is scarred by losing his race he cant seem to hold on to anyone he is entirely alone even with the ones who do stick with him he is to all intents and purposes eternal thats his tragedy
2845235 its too easy to become defined by your press cuttings
2845236 im much happier going on a radio show and talking nonsense for 20 minutes i am an actor after all
2845237 he was 22 and had only just started acting yet his confidence and determination were extraordinary
2845238 often when we go out together large groups of women will visibly go weak at the knees
2845239 assume that growing up in a manse must be a puritanical existence
2845240 i was a junkie a doctor who junkie every saturday evening at 5 35 i could not be disturbed any noise or distinctive movement would be met with the wrath of a furious nine year old i was worshipping at the shrine
2845241 i didnt say a word to anyone apart from my doctor who doll
2845242 he was a very bright boy quick and witty he was an accomplished actor from early on
2845243 im the only scottish actor alive who hasnt been in taggart
2845244 you feel the weight of history there and its scary
2845245 wed established that we were both fans and he seemed the obvious choice i think david brings to it a fantastic sense of humour he can find lightness even in the darkest of scenes
2845246 with the firefighters rule the reasoning is that they voluntarily agreed to undertake these risks they know going in that fighting crime or fighting fires is dangerous
2845247 additionally they are paid well to encounter the risks theyre given a whole packet of benefits to compensate them if theyre injured so allowing them to sue citizens would almost be like double taxation
2845248 if people worry that they might be sued by police officers or firefighters they might hesitate to call on them for help and that would be bad public policy
2845249 i went through my own hard times and i did some soul searching
2845250 my job was to protect that day and thats what i did thats the risk i took and i know the price i paid i cannot imagine what karen mies went through burying a husband and a son
2845251 he was very sick he needed help too i had nightmares for a while when i decided not to be part of the lawsuit my nightmares stopped
2845252 i do think its going to relieve that yes and as this community grows then this school will become larger school i believe because theyre really making subdivisions and new developments i really think its going to grow
2845253 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock

2845256 gives little reason to expect a september rate hike which we previously had thought was possible
2845257 while the committee is undoubtedly concerned about inflation the statement points to an expected moderation in inflation and implicitly notes the recent fall in energy and some commodity prices
2845258 the first leg of the decline in commodities is under our belt
2845259 the big overarching message is how robust the pipeline is and how were developing on all fronts and moving in some unexpected directions
2845260 i suspect were going to have to hit the pathways at multiple steps kind of like combination chemotherapy for cancer
2845261 weve collected very valuable data on the progression of the disease in its earliest stages we are confident that the results of this study will help researchers in their quest to develop new and better treatments
2845262 this is a continuing question in alzheimers research how do you monitor peoples progress
2845263 there has been a focus on moving the detection threshold earlier and earlier into asymptomatic individuals to accomplish that we need biomarkers to tell who is at greater or lesser risk as people age
2845264 living in a couple relationship is normally one of the most intense forms of social and intellectual stimulation if social and cognitive challenges can protect against dementia so should living in a couple relationship
2845265 each of these risk factors has a low predictive value we need to figure out which combination of risk factors has the best predictive accuracy
2845266 were it not stopped in its tracks we would have seen some real problems with respect to beneficiaries getting the access to care that they traditionally have had
2845267 this will increase the work for my staff and the hospital discharge planner and will result in a delay in the patients discharge which will ultimately cost medicare more in the long run
2845268 i dont believe they can tweak the program enough to get it to the point where we can outbid the big companies
2845269 its clear under south dakotas doctrine of informed consent that patients are entitled to all the available relevant information about a procedure be it good or bad
2845270 why should we apply a different principle to abortion than in every other medical context
2845271 goes beyond what any doctor should have to discuss with his or her patient and does not help the patient make the best medical decision for herself
2845272 imposes unprecedented restrictions on women seeking abortion and unprecedented demands on their physicians
2845273 i began cutting costs by turning off the lights when patients were out of the office and putting the computers on power saving mode you need to try and save every penny you can these days
2845274 i dont keep the temperature ice cold in the summer or too hot in the winter and when at all possible i open the windows for fresh air im on the second floor so there is no issue with people looking in
2845275 they are 12 14 years old max and they line them up for the world and having the government back them
2845276 since they forced an age limit it has gotten worse and worse the fig is running away from the age problem they set an age limit and now they cant control it
2845277 i know from working in a totalitarian state that the government will falsify documents that allow for child abuse so the solution is to get rid of the age requirement
2845278 im sure bela saw injuries but if you were injured bela didnt want to see it you had to deal with it i was intimidated he looked down on me he was 6 feet something and i was 4 foot nothing
2845279 you know she one of the chinese competitors begged her parents to come home but they didnt let her and we are lucky they didnt because we got to see that performance
2845280 prime healthcares ongoing practice of putting consumers in the middle of billing disputes between providers and health plans is the largest example of this egregious practice weve seen to date and it must be stopped
2845281 consumers who have purchased health coverage in good faith deserve to know that it will cover them in a medical emergency and not result in crushing medical debt
2845282 if insurers are allowed to unilaterally set payment rates and physicians have no way to respond insurers can underfund not only physicians themselves but the whole health care delivery system
2845283 right now the burden is on physicians to chase the money and it should be reversed because insurers are supposed to bear the risk and be responsible for paying their enrollees bills
2845284 the term contracting provider refers to physicians who have freely negotiated a contract with health care service plans
2845285 the simple way to keep patients out of the middle is to have hmos pay fairly and properly
2845286 there is a very wide variety of what hospitals and physicians are charging for the same procedure even in the same region
2845287 any process variation for which a recurrence would carry a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome
2845288 already been used to remove from the medical staff physicians who have a different opinion from administration
2845289 if somebodys not a team player individuals will try to remove them from the team and the disruptive physician policy is one mechanism by which that can be done
2845290 intimidating and disruptive behaviors include overt actions such as verbal outbursts and physical threats as well as passive activities such as refusing to perform assigned tasks or quietly exhibiting uncooperative attitudes during routine activities such behaviors include reluctance or refusal to answer questions return phone calls or pages condescending language or voice intonation and impatience with questions
2845291 undermine team effectiveness and can compromise the safety of patients
2845292 i think the new disruptive behavior standard puts a lot of physicians particularly ethical physicians at great peril
2845293 its an issue that needs to be addressed hospitals have been reluctant to confront some disruptive physicians because they are often heavy admitters
2845294 managing disruptive physician behavior impact on staff relationships and patient care
2845295 people tend to have a different feeling about ads in journals than industry supported symposia or minority fellowships or even the exhibit area free pens and other things that are made available
2845296 when people complain and say they want the apa to not accept pharmaceutical revenue theyve not done it head on in the sense that we would have to cut some activity
2845297 many people who go to these symposia can guess very very quickly based on the title of the symposium and based on the speakers that are hired which company funds them even without looking at the logo that the company has to display to disclose that theyre funding it
2845298 my sense of the mandate of the work group is that everything is on the table
2845299 health industry practices that create conflicts of interest a policy proposal for academic medical centers
2845300 given what we know about the dangers of smoking it is astonishing that tobacco products are one of the least regulated products in our society
2845301 congressional action to provide the fda with strong and effective regulatory authority over tobacco products is long overdue
2845302 trying to make cigarettes safer through a billion dollar bureaucracy is a waste of time and money
2845303 running is never considered a goal for outpatient rehab but it is a goal for our patients
2845304 i dont know how we can deny them that opportunity and that training
2845305 these are complicated patients who are going through a lot were here to provide them the best care and motivate them
2845306 we encourage amputees burn patients and limb salvage patients to be as active as they can thats going to make them healthier in the long run
2845307 is a blessing for anybody in my situation if you look at the old amputee clinics and you look at this one this is so much more of an upgrade
2845308 were really trying to meet their needs at every level
2845309 its very accurate data that we can feed back to prosthetics or other physicians
2845310 we can look at muscle activation we can do metabolic testing how much energy are they using
2845311 were barely scratching the surface of what we can do with that
2845312 the camaraderie within the rehab environment is critical to the improvement of our patients
2845313 we try to make it easier on the patients here by bringing all the different specialties that take care of them together at one time so that they dont have to go to different clinics and different appointments
2845314 it also makes their attendance much better it makes everybodys job easier and then we can also talk to each other
2845315 casualties of war military care for the wounded from iraq and afghanistan
2845316 well be tasked im sure to prove that these things are valuable in functional progression but thats ok were up for that challenge
2845317 i would hope that it would be able to bring out research to help civilian amputees improve function and quality of life
2845318 this is an area where it is increasingly clear that we can see the beginnings of the characteristic end organ complications of diabetes that may ultimately lead to blindness kidney failure or amputation
2845319 we dont mean to create a brand new illness but we mean to draw attention to this gap between what is clearly normal and what is disease
2845320 we all agree that lifestyle is the first way to go but we have to recognize that in those at the highest risk lifestyle might not be enough

2845328 we need the vitamin d that sunshine provides to help us absorb calcium and avoid osteoporosis
2845329 it may also be useful in prevention of heart disease breast and prostate cancer boosting the immune system and have anti ageing effects
2845330 and according to irish researchers it can reverse the inflammatory effects associated with age related memory decline
2845331 not getting sunburnt the body can store vitamin d for 60 days after gentle daily exposure
2845332 this could be due to other factors such as relaxation a change of climate or diet
2845333 however sea water has antiseptic properties and may reduce an infection associated with the eczema it may also help to heal the skin but you need to be extra intensive with emollients before and after swimming to prevent any drying effect wash the salt off afterwards then moisturise

2845386 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2845387 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2845388 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2845389 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2845390 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2845391 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2845392 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2845393 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2845394 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2845395 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2845396 but i was a willing participant you can call it lust i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded
2845397 i gave out lots of hugs and saw tons of smiles its great the way this town has our back there is no better feeling that giving back to all these fans i cant wait to see all of them for the season opener
2845398 we are running backs you know we like to run the option we figured fans can go left or right they choose and if they are lucky they might get to hit both lines hopefully it is speeding things up

2845411 the earlier start of the academic is having an impact on when families take their final summer vacations and as a result more people are traveling in the deadliest period of the year however this august may not be as deadly as we are seeing a trend of motorists cutting back on their driving due to higher gas prices
2845412 some people are legitimately stranded and although ive never seen a report in prince william of anyone getting victimized for stopping to assist someone my best advice is to contact police
2845413 fear is causing the altruistic motorist to become a dying breed
2845414 six in 10 62 percent drivers would consider stopping and helping someone at the roadside but more than half 53 percent of these charitable motorists admit theyre less likely to stop today and help a breakdown victim than they were 10 years ago
2845415 close to three quarters 71 per cent of charitable drivers believe british people are more aggressive now than in 1996 and among all drivers 31 per cent would never consider pulling over to help a fellow driver in need with more than half 59 percent of these drivers believing its just too risky to open their car doors to talk to strangers
2845416 the rent we owe our fellow citizens is to at least extend the courtesy of asking do you need me call anyone
2845417 you have failed to make progress with orientation thus far

2845419 well yea who needs them i will go work somewhere else
2845420 hes been phenomenal in getting that program up and running
2845421 hes a hard worker he connects with the community and he cares about what he does

2845429 while the current science establishment has churned out many a study demonstrating the relationships between co2 and global temperatures or warming oceans and hurricane frequency there have been very few studies that attempt to predict the consequences of climate change on the regional level the research we now need the most studies that examine the future of glacial run off in afghanistan or the viability of future large scale rice growing in southeast asia is the research that is hardest to find if we truly want to thrive in a warming world it is time for scientific institutions to stop trying to prove that global warming is bad it is and start giving policy makers data they can use to save lives

2845460 nuestra postura es completamente contraria a la propuesta de revisi n actual planteada ya que no tiene en cuenta el contexto de desaceleraci n econ mica el precio del combustible ni la limitada aportaci n del transporte a reo a las emisiones que no llega al 3
2845461 la propuesta es equilibrada en tanto en un primer momento exige una reducci n moderada de las emisiones por otro lado la sujeci n a un r gimen de comercio de derechos de emisi n es una opci n que permite compatibilizar la eficacia en el logro del objetivo ambiental con la flexibilidad para las empresas a la hora de dise ar sus estrategias de cumplimiento frente a otras opciones como el empleo de tasas o medidas regulatorias que impongan determinados niveles m ximos de emisiones

2845470 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2845471 i am only weeping for the fact that people will continue to be fasting and performing prayers after my death while i will no longer be in a position to do likewise
2845472 when the month of ramadaan enters gates of paradise are opened gates of hell are closed and devils are chained
2845473 by allaah if not because of waking up in the night and performing prayers i would not have loved this world for the night is precious because of its darkness and performing the prayers during the night is one of the characteristics of righteous people
2845474 nobody abandons night prayers except that it is regarded as a punishment for a sin he has committed
2845475 nothing brings allaahs blessings and prevents his punishment than obeying him moving closer to him through acts of ibaadah and being kind to his creatures
2845476 it is a strange thing that muslims should abandon itikaaf while the messenger of allaah e never skipped it right from the time he entered madeenah until his death
2845477 obama connects with the plate lunch spirit on hawaii vacation
2845478 he went off and voted with minority leader harry reid on the democratic substitute and i wrote him the now famous letter
2845479 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere
2845480 im embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble
2845481 that was one incident where he thought i had undercut him i had a completely different view of it
2845482 we had to take tough votes sometimes against the majority of our own party in order to preserve the coalition
2845483 when colleagues disagree on an issue the notion that its cause for attack is mistaken i felt very strongly that the guest worker program was not in the best interests of the country i voted against it he voted for it i respect senator mccains right to take positions different than mine what i dont do is abuse his integrity for doing so
2845484 i think he made it look much easier than it was
2845485 i didnt think i was going to get to it
2845486 i took off running in a dead sprint and tried to pick it up later i picked it up later and with a little luck it fell in my glove
2845487 he was looking back into a high sky with sun
2845488 when that balls hit he knows hes the only guy with a chance for it which helps somewhat he knows hes going to go as hard as he can
2845489 if he doesnt get it its a huge run with rivera down there in the pen
2845490 i was pumped i gave a little emotion i didnt want to do i was trying to be the first to get to him he backed me up good that was an awesome play
2845491 they pitched me tough this series working me in and away
2845492 he left a fastball over the plate and i hit it good to left center i was thinking about going for two there and i might have had a chance but i stayed at first and it worked out for us
2845493 i didnt think it should have got through the infield
2845494 without seeing the replay its hard for me to tell exactly but i didnt think it should have gone through
2845495 youre not going to take pitches off him you have to swing the bat and put the ball in play hopefully itll find a hole
2845496 i was being aggressive and that was a perfect base hit
2845497 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy im just glad its out of the way now
2845498 now we can settle back in and really focus on our next opponents the game was just over the top
2845499 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you
2845500 we are going to crack jokes thats what we do it was a very light conversation his family was there his father his wife his daughter
2845501 he did his homework he knew that some of us he had met before he had the scouting report on the other guys
2845502 even on a rainy and humid game night excitement was palpable
2845503 we could sense the enormous pride that the chinese have in their team
2845504 im sure it was difficult for them to cheer for the us but they wanted to see an entertaining game they wanted to see two teams go at it
2845505 this is a personal olympics for me everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people were cheering
2845506 if you write a book and you said how am i going to start this game out yao hitting a three with the fist pump with the excitement it was great it was great for basketball and we couldnt do nothing but smile on the sideline
2845507 we came out a little tight we knew it would be a very emotional game for both teams especially china
2845508 we withstood the storm and calmed down and played a lot better basketball
2845509 i have been fortunate enough to play in nba finals and numerous big games but it was just a different energy man it felt like there was just so much more support because it was the usa and obviously how proud the fans were of their country china
2845510 we understood that it was just bigger than the game it wasnt just a finals game it wasnt a seventh game it was bigger than that
2845511 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2845512 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2845513 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2845514 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2845515 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2845516 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2845517 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2845518 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2845519 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac

2845526 i really did like the fact that no other european has won two majors consecutively i hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special to me
2845527 this was a different win to the one at birkdale
2845528 something had me a little off my stride this week at birkdale i was quite assured of what i was doing here i really didnt know
2845529 i definitely felt like i played well enough to win
2845530 to shoot 69 68 in the last two rounds of a major on a course like this i think thats pretty positive
2845531 as long as i could hang in there i knew id get my opportunity even though i was two or three shots behind and it was looking like sergios day i kept in there
2845532 im glad i gave myself an opportunity to make birdie and finish second alone it just didnt happen
2845533 what can you do there can only be one winner im fine

2845575 the federal government has published long awaited draft regulations that make up an important part of the conservative green plan
2845576 critics have said the regulations are long overdue but their release helps the tories avoid increasingly frequent criticism from the liberals that the government is dragging its heels on the environment file we should have had the detailed regulations for industry in place long ago instead we have a draft of a very small piece said david mcguinty a liberal mp and his partys environment critic that the government released this on the friday night of the opening of the olympic games is telling canadians a lot about this governments action on environment they hope canadians wont notice that they are doing nothing
2845577 were choosing to go after big polluters said mr baird the liberals are going after the middle class
2845578 to offset the higher prices caused by their new tax the liberals plan offers consumers a massive income tax cut
2845579 mr baird conceded that some forms of energy would be more expensive under his governments approach but instead of tax cuts the conservatives are setting up a technology fund that businesses can tap into to develop new ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions
2845580 once a law or regulation is noted in the gazette ignorance of it is no longer a legal defence
2845581 the government released this on the friday night of the opening of the olympic games

2845594 senator john mccain likes to present himself as the candidate of the straight talk express who does not pander to voters or change his positions with the political breeze but the fine print of his record in the senate indicates that he has been a lot less consistent on some of his signature issues than he has presented himself to be so far in his presidential campaign
2845595 has also expressed varying positions on immigration torture abortion and donald h rumsfeld the former defense secretary
2845596 it sounds like hes trying to have it both ways and its not convincing anyone
2845597 neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer reaches of american politics and the agents of intolerance whether they be louis farrakhan or al sharpton on the left or pat robertson and jerry falwell on the right
2845598 an olive branch to christian conservatives who could impede his presidential ambitions
2845599 a fter mccain accepted the invitation critics accused him of pandering for political purposes

2845624 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area

2845649 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2845650 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2845651 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2845652 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2845653 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2845654 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2845655 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2845656 the increase in wind speeds here is due to the depression over orissa normality will be restored in about two days
2845657 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2845658 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2845659 the vice president expressed the with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2845660 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2845661 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2845662 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2845663 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2845664 i remember my younger sister savannah was born at 6 29 p
2845665 he said at his canton home on a recent furlough
2845666 but i met someone i grew up with and i didnt know his name
2845667 when i woke up i didnt know my last name my rank or what a square was
2845668 he had lost 40 pounds and was still black and blue
2845669 we were numb our son was the shell of who he had been
2845670 i say come spend a few days with us and you will see
2845671 his problems didnt bother me they drew me to him even more
2845672 i thought she would think i was stupid because i stuttered
2845673 i told her once that she needed to leave i didnt deserve anyone
2845674 i tell them to focus on respect compassion and love for each other
2845675 i told him that he came out pretty darn good though and people look up to him for his honors
2845676 i was sick before the trip even started and stayed sick for 10 days i didnt think there could ever be anything worse than that but as soon as we got to guadalcanal i learned better
2845677 i know i never want to pick any cotton again thats for sure
2845678 we werent at war but it was still good training and i enjoyed it
2845679 but after a while we could tell the difference in japanese and american planes so we knew when to worry and when not to
2845680 we had official control of the islands but there were always some enemy there and you never knew how bad things were going to be
2845681 you had to have a sense of humor it helped everyone survive
2845682 those guys knew how to get it done and thats all they cared about
2845683 it was the best group you could have picked for that job
2845684 we were under constant attack and we never got a day off it was work every day and get bombed every night without a break it really screwed up your eating and sleeping schedule after a year or so you just made up your mind to live with it and move on and get the job done
2845685 it was great to have that good food in the middle of all that mess it was just wonderful
2845686 wed done a good job but wed lost some friends too and it was great to hear it was all over
2845687 well when youve been with a ball club for so long and you have had a lot of success obviously its kind of tough to break ties and go in a whole new direction
2845688 but again as weve seen throughout this whole saga its a business and sometimes organizations try to put a leash on you and try to control everything thats there and i guess if it happens to brett it can happen to all of us
2845689 its a lot different than last year a lot different than last year and it will show but thats not what its really about its about just going out and trying to make plays and trying to win games
2845690 it was an experience it was a learning experience i got a chance to see how fast the game was i only got a taste of it in practice
2845691 you know it really was tough because you couldnt get in a pass rush rhythm
2845692 they werent dropping back much they wanted to run the ball and we held our own
2845693 well i thought the whole offensive line did a great job in the run game and in the pass game and that includes max
2845694 he was excited about his performance and we were excited as well
2845695 they take extraordinary measures to avoid it if faced with the object of fear they may become unable to perform even normal tasks and get panicky break into a sweat experience rapid heartbeats and even difficulty in breathing
2845696 instead of self help seeking the help of mental health professionals is recommended for early diagnosis intervention and relapse prevention strategies
2845697 if you notice avoidance reactions excessive anxiety distress associated with anxiety secondary depression and disruption of daily activities and interference with work school performance you need to seek medical help
2845698 the idea is to systematically desensitise the person about the object or situation he fears
2845699 minimum standard of living necessary for health efficiency and general well being of workers
2845700 a just minimum wage good for workers business and our future
2845701 raise the floor wages and policies that work for all of us
2845702 a just minimum wage good for workers business and our future
2845703 i had to go out for shopping on sunday because i remain busy in the rest of the week but the incessant rain spoiled my day
2845704 this reporter was sound asleep in my bed early saturday when my phone rang at 5 15 a m bringing me the sad sad news that chicagos beloved and brilliant comedian actor bernie mac aka bernard mccullough had succumbed to pneumonia
2845705 a source close to the grieving family told me his beautiful and devoted wife of over 30 years rhonda mccullough and their beloved only child jeniece were at his bedside when he made his transition
2845706 but the fact is that no one is taking her candidacy seriously so her offer is kind of moot
2845707 shes been trying for years to keep herself on the front page of tabloids and glossy gossip magazines to no avail

2845728 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2845729 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2845730 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2845731 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2845732 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2845733 other people might look at him with pity but he has dealt with it he could handle anything
2845734 hes living his dream he runs the property he wanted to run he has a daughter and were in the happiest place we have ever been

2845748 its completely untrue ridiculous ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false

2845762 ibrahim hooper indicated in a 1993 interview with the minneapolis star tribune that
2845763 asked in an america online sponsored chat in august 1998 mr hooper wrote
2845764 when asked in a subsequent phone interview with this columnist mr hooper said
2845765 when asked by the washington post in november 2001 mr hooper responded
2845766 asked by the pittsburgh post gazette in february 2002 mr hooper called such questions
2845767 ibrahim hooper spokesman for the council on american islamic relations was on paula zahns cnn show tonight with dennis prager and christopher hitchens
2845768 appearing on fox news recently the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations cair ibrahim hooper said
2845769 how would you feel if your children came home from school and told you about this
2845770 fighting for freedom fighting for islam that is not suicide
2845771 the only specific accusation is that hlf funds feed the orphans of suicide bombers along with hundreds of other children
2845772 the most trusted and largest islamic charitable organization in the u s sends a wrong message to muslims all over the world basically that israel gets to dictate our foreign policy
2845773 really makes american muslims feel that they are not going to get a fair shake in the justice system
2845774 american muslims view yesterdays action as just one of a long list of attempts by the pro israel lobby to intimidate and silence all those who wish to see palestinian muslims and christians free themselves of a brutal apartheid like occupation
2845775 we believe the genesis of this raid lies not in washington but in tel aviv
2845776 a growing disparity and climate of injustice for muslims who we feel are being selectively prosecuted and given unfair sentences precisely because they are muslim or arab
2845777 this campaign has been orchestrated to serve as a wedge between america and islamic countries
2845778 his past speeches and participation in fund raising activities could be supportive of terrorist organizations
2845779 the whole muslim community today is under a microscope of scrutiny
2845780 ive never heard violence preached ive never heard anti semitism or anti americanism preached

2845782 theyre making money on wall street but theyre not generating oil and not increasing supplies to reduce the cost at the pump
2845783 you cant hold a team like that down forever we had a couple of bad breaks you lose a ball in the sun in the first inning it could be a different game
2845784 but i dont mind cause thats the way ive been feeling
2845785 were trying to provide an opportunity for people to come up north and contribute to our economy google is not going to move to west branch
2845786 we dont want a lot of people going home angry because they got a ticket because of confusion
2845787 make way for atvs new law will put more off road vehicles on road shoulders
2845788 the icing on the cake relief joy exhaustion the culmination of 14 years in the sport and still being able to do it eight years after i got hurt
2845789 now that ive gotten a little taste of it i dont know i guess i may have to negotiate a little with my husband
2845790 shes getting pressure from her coaches to keep going because she hasnt peaked yet
2845791 its only been a year since shes been able to compete full time without issues in her back from the old injury shes still got the best in her the coaches are licking their chops and i can see why its hard to retire when youre on your way up
2845792 nothings been decided so we dont want to close any doors
2845793 attending the olympics is a sign of respect to the chinese people
2845794 el balance es positivo pudimos haber ganado el partido demostramos que tenemos variantes pero soy consciente de que tenemos que seguir trabajando
2845795 el equipo se tiene que ir acomodando a las ausencias de carrizo ortega y abreu por eso es probable que a sus funciones las deban ir asumiendo y cumpliendo otros jugadores
2845796 the whole reason why this project came about is because we have to fix our levees
2845797 no one is more concerned about border security than those of us who live and raise families on the border
2845798 i just want the damn fence built ill let the libs and the intellectuals sit around and worry about irony
2845799 i was simply acknowledging that in the construction industry a pretty significant percentage of workers are obviously undocumented
2845800 you may find that there could be an individual on the job site that is not legal even though you went through various processes to check
2845801 the politicians and the business leaders are finally starting to realize that all this violence theyre having right across the river in reynosa and matamoros in tamaulipas is caused by the drug trade
2845802 if the fence will stop the drugs from coming across here well then the drug people will go someplace else
2845803 theres no way im going to be able to understand how those physics work just watching the trailer made my head hurt
2845804 the difference is theyre based around the same myth not the same universe or whatever else
2845805 controls are too much fun to waste on just one set of game rules
2845806 no it hasnt been determined yet as of the moment
2845807 well like to make a game thats fun to play and looks cool

2845811 aix s com una guerra sha datacar per tots els fronts al mateix temps
2845812 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2845813 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2845814 im thankful we werent here our grandkids came up to visit us for the week none of them were in the building im just so thankful for that
2845815 this is just me personally i was very big for the second we got kameo out for hitting the deck running and going right were doing kameo 2 were going to take 12 to 18 months to do it bang its done
2845816 but for one reason or another we didnt do that in the time frame where you could hit that sweet spot so shes got to take a hiatus
2845817 that is the unknown it could be short it could be long it depends on the team it depends on the market it depends on the portfolio from other studios theres so many factors that get involved in making that decision that its impossible to say at any one time
2845818 i could say to you now no 18 months at least in reality everything might come into alignment at the end of next week and suddenly its like yeah go and start doing that and it might be out of our control it might be because suddenly theres a massive gap in the portfolio where theres no games like that at all coming down the pipe in two years time
2845819 and then if the resources were there lets say banjos finished but they decide they want to do something different and then theres this opening for kameo what im saying now could be completely wrong in three months four months time but its not something that one studio can just go yes we are going to do this now because if you do that thats when you might time it wrong
2845820 all of the key scenes the things anyone is going to take a screenshot of are going to look exactly the same on both platforms theyll get the high quality compression
2845821 but if you go into some areas in the wasteland like behind a fence where nobody will typically go and explore this is where the 360 version may look a little blurry compared to the ps3
2845822 were pretty much resigned to the fact that were going to make it fit onto two dvds on the 360
2845823 plus there would be a lot of disc switching if we went to three dvds and since the game is split between two different wasteland environments two dvds should work well thats the only thing the ps3 has going for it over the 360 more gigs
2845824 little or no differences only differences on area when players usually wont seing
2845825 this rating would act as a deterrent to most to build and the cost implications are seen to be large
2845826 they the comments were in the speech that was posted but she never gave that speech
2845827 paid work is the route to independence and well being for most people and is the best way to reduce child poverty
2845828 long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
2845829 instead we will be going one better and will focus on long term unemployed by requiring them to get paid work and get off the benefit
2845830 within 12 months of taking office national will require everyone who has been on the dole for more than a year to re apply for their benefit and undergo a comprehensive work assessment
2845831 brain injury from a short distance fall can be consistent with the features in this case
2845832 we recognise that short distance falls can cause this type of injury frankly they are rare but they do occur
2845833 osetia del sur si esto no es guerra no s qu es

2845836 amendments to the present charter shall apply to all members of the united nations if issued with the consent of two thirds of the members of the general assembly and ratified by one third members of the united nations including all permanent members of the security council
2845837 settle disputes through the political process instead of through violence
2845838 its probably going to be fairly important to have elections within the coming year as a means of regulating this competition
2845839 they are by their very nature an intense struggle for power
2845840 demand the security council get out of iraq under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations
2845841 let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless in facing them let me not beg for the stilling of my pain but for the heart to conquer it
2845842 concentrate put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket
2845843 in our back catalogue ive made no secret about the fact that if i was to do another xbla game because that fitted in with what we do which it doesnt at the moment and that is at the moment because id done jetpac and wed already got a fairly strong idea for lunar jetman id kind of like to do that providing i was given a hard deadline of six months so it was really tight and quick mainly because theres that idea already there
2845844 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
2845845 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
2845846 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly d ue to the defense ministers personal involvement
2845847 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
2845848 the goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists make no mistake about it we intend to keep bashing the dead white males and the live ones and the females too until the social construct known as the white race is destroyed not deconstructed but destroyed
2845849 if white men were not complaining it would be an indication we werent succeeding and making the inroads that we are
2845850 the game will utilize a new server architecture 6 to support online battles with up to 256 players with users divided into 8 player squads

2845855 in 1997 part of this act was overturned by the united states supreme court because it overstepped congresss power to enforce the fourteenth amendment the roman catholic archdiocese of san antonio wanted to enlarge a church in boerne texas but a boerne ordinance protected the church as a historic landmark and did not permit it to be torn down the church sued citing rfra and in the resulting case city of boerne v flores 521 u s 507 1997 the supreme court struck down the rfra stating that congress had stepped beyond their power of enforcement in response to the boerne ruling congress passed the religious land use and institutionalized persons act rluipa in 2000

2845857 it got really windy and the rain started hitting and they started try to figure out what to do with the windows and the next thing you know it hit so hard we didnt know what to do
2845858 you could hardly see the wind was blowing hard and debris was flying all over the place
2845859 we noticed the rain was coming down and someone said the trash can was blowing away so we came out to grab it and someone said look out and the roof was coming off the building it came down pretty good
2845860 its more than just the roof theyre going to inspect the wiring or whatever else there might be for water damage

2845877 in our earlier study areas of stress were largely located at the outer suburban mortgage belts where car dependency is high
2845878 in this study we have seen the number and geographical range of vulnerable households creep inwards as fuel costs and interest rates rise
2845879 worse the deficits in urban infrastructure and services meant the more vulnerable households had less ability to adapt to higher fuel costs by taking public transport
2845880 across australias cities public transport is bursting at the seams during peak hour which gives clear evidence people will use public transport when it becomes just too costly not to
2845881 state governments nationwide are debating measures such as underground loops and light rail which is great but will only assist inner urban residents who are already the least vulnerable in society we need to get new trains and buses into our outer suburbs
2845882 since world war ii australias cities have been planned on the presumption that cars running on low priced fuel would be the dominant means of transportation
2845883 the australian senate estimates peak oil to occur by 2030 so a broad comprehensive plan to reconstruct australian suburbs to reduce petrol reliance must begin now
2845884 we expect solid organic growth as we build upon our strong position in our core markets and expand into new ones
2845885 we remain well placed to benefit from record spending in essential infrastructure in the asia pacific region ongoing growth in the australian resources sector and the global trend for outsourcing of non core services
2845886 we are mindful of global economic uncertainty and the challenging cost environment but barring any unforeseen factors our current forecasts suggest another year of double digit earnings growth in 2009
2845887 our balance sheet is stronger than ever and we continue our bias towards lower risk alliance contracts and blue chip partners
2845888 the issue of work rights and higher wages is shaping up as a significant one for our members and other working people and the national party is doing all it can to shut us out of public debate on their negative policies
2845889 the union will not be wasting any more time or resources on nationals legal challenges
2845890 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2845891 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2845892 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2845893 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2845894 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year
2845895 good lawd did you load this into the cah yself i aint gonna sass you none

2845899 isaac hayes was our emissary to the world for over four decades
2845900 his music and his love of his fellow man transcended all racial boundaries his contributions to this city and its culture were many and his friends were even more numerous i was fortunate enough to have him as my friend and i was blessed to have his support in my most recent election
2845901 we believe the business model employed by bendigo and adelaide bank is strong and unique
2845902 our non negotiable focus on customers communities and partners and a strategic focus on growth at profitable prices means we are able to create value throughout the business cycle
2845903 we remain predominantly funded by retail deposits our credit quality remains sound and our prospects for growth remain solid
2845904 the bendigo bank retail network continues to expand by around 25 branches each year and with a high proportion of branches yet to reach maturity future income growth is to some extent locked in
2845905 we are also taking the opportunity afforded by the current disruption to wholesale markets to reshape those businesses for growth and improved margins once funding begins to flow again
2845906 the current market conditions demonstrate the strength and flexibility of the merged bank
2845907 while current conditions have challenged our wholesale businesses we have been able to leverage the strength of our retail franchise to sustain our momentum
2845908 equally as conditions improve for our wholesale businesses they will be well placed to ride the upswing
2845909 daarom is er uitvoerig onderzoek gedaan en wordt nu eerst een proef gehouden

2845911 the stocks most sensitive to oil prices are the ones doing the best today but its also a really broad rally
2845912 investors are responding to the decline in commodity prices that weve seen recently
2845913 theyre rotating out of the fundamentally strongest groups and into sectors that may benefit going forward if oil prices continue to retreat
2845914 i dont think the u s consumer is going to come roaring back but some of these sectors are really depressed
2845915 a stronger dollar would be very bullish for stocks in terms of restoring faith globally in the u s marketplace
2845916 if the australian dollar continues to fall in the way that it has you could get that heightened pass through
2845917 surveys suggest a softening in business activity and there have also been some early signs of an easing in labour market conditions
2845918 the rise in australias terms of trade that is currently occurring is working in the opposite direction adding substantially to national income and ability to spend at the same time high prices of oil and a range of other commodities have added to global inflationary risks
2845919 i think while it will be a policy consideration its clear the rbas policy focus has shifted away from inflation concerns to deteriorating domestic activity and growth
2845920 whereas previously the dollar had come under pressure because of risk aversion and the credit crunch now were seeing a global decline in demand
2845921 our outlook for 2009 is extremely cautious however we are coming off a strong financial year and we have an established strategy in place
2845922 we expect solid organic growth as we build upon our strong position in our core markets and expand into new ones
2845923 we are mindful of global economic uncertainty and the challenging cost environment but barring any unforeseen factors our current forecasts suggest another year of double digit earnings growth in 2009
2845924 already we have locked in a large portion of our revenue target for the year and bidding opportunities are at record levels
2845925 we expect solid organic growth as we build upon our strong position in our core markets and expand into new ones all our sectors present significant opportunities in this regard
2845926 meanwhile our balance sheet is stronger than ever and we continue our bias towards lower risk alliance contracts and blue chip partners
2845927 organic growth from uniteds core engineering and property services businesses underpinned the result while us based facilities manager ugl unicco made a strong contribution
2845928 we remain well placed to benefit from record spending in essential infrastructure in the asia pacific region

2845933 right now the jewish communists socialists zionists and bundists are presenting an unprecedented affront to g d why should we orthodox jewry have to fast because of their sins
2845934 the medrash says clearly that since we are all in the same boat it doesnt matter if it is someone elses fault that we are sinking because he has decided to drill a hole to save ourselves we have to undo the damage made by the other person
2845935 we find on taanis 19a that rabi yosi said that the sages didnt declare a fast because a tragedy had already happened rather they declared a fast because they were able to see that a potential tragedy was looming on the horizon they declared a fast because wolves had devoured two young children on the far side of the yarden rabi yosi said they werent eaten they were seen if the chachomim felt that just spotting the wolves is enough of a reason to declare a fast surely our situation is no less threatening and we pasken like rabi yosi

2846002 but american diplomats conceded that the us had few options and ruled out military intervention on behalf of georgia
2846003 we need russias co operation over iran and derailing that over a localised conflict in georgia makes no sense we just have to hope that diplomacy prevails the next necessary step is for russia to respond positively to georgias ceasefire declaration
2846004 a white house spokesman says the u s and french presidents share the same position on the escalating conflict between georgia and russia over south ossetia he says both want to see a cease fire disengagement and respect for georgias territorial integrity
2846005 national is committed to a benefit system that is a genuine safety net in times of need we also recognise that many people on a benefit will never be able to work because of illness or disability
2846006 national is going to have an unrelenting focus on work
2846007 paid work is the route to independence and well being for most people and is the best way to reduce child poverty long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
2846008 national will extend the part time work obligation to two groups of beneficiaries dpb recipients once their youngest dependent child is aged six or over and people on sickness and invalid benefits who have been assessed as being able to work part time
2846009 these beneficiaries will be required to spend at least 15 hours per week in employment training or job seeking activities
2846010 national will not be introducing a work for dole or community wage scheme instead we will be going one better and will focus on long term unemployed by requiring them to get paid work and get off the benefit
2846011 within 12 months of taking office national will require everyone who has been on the dole for more than a year to re apply for their benefit and undergo a comprehensive work assessment
2846012 all long term unemployment beneficiaries will be required to do what it takes to secure employment this may include practical training attending a basic skills course or attending drug and alcohol rehabilitation
2846013 after that they will be required to actively look for a job go to any job interview they are referred to and accept any suitable offer of employment if they dont comply with these obligations their benefits will be reduced in the first instance then suspended then cancelled
2846014 currently work and income case managers have with few exceptions only one option and that is to stop payments of a persons benefit altogether
2846015 this is a severe sanction and has very significant effects on peoples lives case managers have to think long and hard about whether they apply this sanction especially to single people and those who have only part time work obligations
2846016 therefore national is going to introduce a more graduated system of sanctions for people who do not comply with their work obligations we will introduce at least one intermediate step which will be a reduction in benefit before a full suspension
2846017 this step or steps will give work and income case managers more flexibility and additional tools to encourage beneficiaries to comply with their work obligations details of these graduated sanctions will take some working through given the complexity of the benefit system
2846018 national also wants appropriate incentives in the benefit system so those on benefits actually want to work national will therefore make the benefit abatement regime more generous
2846019 beneficiaries and their partners can currently earn up to 80 a week before their benefit is affected
2846020 benefit abatement is a necessary part of the system but the high marginal tax rates it creates are a disincentive for people to work even a few hours a week so national will raise the earnings threshold and allow beneficiaries to earn up to 100 a week before their benefit begins to be abated

2846038 ross alderman was an outstanding public servant he was totally committed to excellence in the performance of the public defenders offices crucial role in the criminal justice systems ross was devoted to the lawyers and other members of the public defenders staff ross was an excellent trial lawyer he was intelligent fearless and highly ethical ross and i worked together for many years in the public defenders office when i was the public defender i created the position of deputy public defender and asked ross to take the position i valued his friendship his legal skills and his ability to be a mentor young attorneys i relied on his excellent judgment ross has served as the public defender since 1999 he did an outstanding job he was a strong leader and advocate for the office ross worked with other agencies and departments to improve the criminal justice systems as a whole judges district attorneys police officers and others respected his thoughtfulness and sound judgment on a personal level ross will be remembers for his dry wit sincerity and his wide range of interests ross was a very hard worker he was almost always the first person to arrive at the public defenders office or any other metro office in morning ross is the thread that runs through the modern history of the public defenders office my thoughts are with his wife patsy and son noah my thoughts are also with the staff of the public defenders office they will miss him enormously as a city we owe him deep thanks for his matchless dedication to justice and public service it was a privilege to have been his friend and colleague
2846039 i have heard and although i am out of town it has stunned me
2846040 nashville has lost an honest approachable leader a hardworking professional and an advocate for anyone seeking a fair hearing in our justice system we lost a good soul ross was a dedicated public servant and a wonderful guy one thing thats always struck me about the nashville public defenders office under his leadership is how motivated and loyal his employees are often under tough circumstances its a strong office full of dedicated attorneys what a great legacy he leaves well miss him
2846041 its hard to find the adjectives to describe him he was a consumate professional
2846042 i had tremendous respect for ross he was an outstanding lawyer and administrator he made an invaluable contribution to justice in davidson county and was a true public servant in every sense of the word
2846043 i have known ross for over 30 years i hired him as an assistant federal public defender in the 70s he had the best work ethic of anyone i ever worked with he had a passion for public service he was a true advocate for the poor he had never run a contested race until a couple of years ago he turned out to be the real candidate he actually ran proudly on his record with no apologies for fighting for the rights of the poor he won he was the best mentor of young lawyers in the city he believed in his work and was generous always with his time i traveled extensively with him over the years he loved traveling reading justice and his family he will be terribly missed
2846044 ross alderman was the trusted leader his only desire was to serve and he committed himself completely to those who needed him most no matter the risk or the cost in an office with a history of excellence ross alderman is today the model for the public defender and he always will be
2846045 the tragic and untimely death of ross is a real loss to the legal community and the community at large he was a fine lawyer dedicated to equal justice for all who will be greatly missed and hard to replace
2846046 ross was the ultimate public servant he cared deeply about doing the best possible job on behalf of his clients and he was equally dedicated to serving the taxpayers well he balance a difficult challenge with great finese
2846047 ross alderman was a superb public servant he chose a difficult job and did it with strong advocacy and excellent management ross was one of the true stars of our communitys legal system however his loss will be felt well beyond community service and professionalism he will always be remembered for his gentle manner his subtle sense of humor and his loyalty in short ross was a wonderful friend

2846060 better than the surrealists is good old nick roerich whose joint at riverside drive and 103rd street is one of my shrines in the pest zone there is something in his handling of perspective and atmosphere which to me suggests other dimensions and alien orders of being or at least the gateways leading to such those fantastic carven stones in lonely upland deserts those ominous almost sentient lines of jagged pinnacles and above all those curious cubical edifices clinging to precipitous slopes and edging upward to forbidden needle like peaks
2846061 the last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy stirring great barren peaks of mystery looming up constantly against the west as the low northern sun of noon or the still lower horizon grazing southern sun of midnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow bluish ice and water lanes and black bits of exposed granite slope through the desolate summits swept raging intermittent gusts of the terrible antarctic wind whose cadences sometimes held vague suggestions of a wild and half sentient musical piping with notes extending over a wide range and which for some subconscious mnemonic reason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible something about the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing asian paintings of nicholas roerich and of the still stranger and more disturbing descriptions of the evilly fabled plateau of leng which occur in the dreaded necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred i was rather sorry later on that i had ever looked into that monstrous book at the college library
2846062 the party reported that the titan barrier range extended endlessly to right and left alike without any diminution in height or essential structure on some of the peaks though the regular cube and rampart formations were bolder and plainer having doubly fantastic similitudes to roerich painted asian hill ruins the distribution of cryptical cave mouths on the black snow denuded summits seemed roughly even as far as the range could be traced

2846073 the essence of league tables is you take one little thing and whack it in a list and say thats all you need to know about your local school
2846074 what we want to know is very comprehensive information about who is in each school because that would tell you something about educational need
2846075 we need to know where that disadvantage lies and we need to know the best methods of addressing it

2846104 ive never done an ebay auction before so i didnt know what to expect but i am upset and frustrated after someone from bristol bid 10m and ive since found out she hasnt got that sort of money
2846105 ive spoken to ebay and the bid stands there are also bids for 9m on there from other people but if the 10m bid is won then that person wont be able to pay for the estate and the auction will have been a waste of time it feels like people have been scuppering my genuine auction
2846106 people putting false bids on ebay should not be allowed however i have had more than 400 emails over the weekend wishing me well for my cancer treatment and many of them saying they are interested in buying all or part of what has been advertised on ebay
2846107 i dont think its worth me getting what i would call premature stress over something that may not occur
2846108 but that doesnt mean im not going to give it serious thought in the meantime
2846109 and both said basically you know were not here to sweeten you up about whether you want to support us or not

2846118 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities mr hotchkies said on the sidelines of a notorious annual defcon gathering of hackers in las vegas
2846119 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2846120 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty said hotchkies who saw a spike this year in the number of defcon attendees carrying macintosh laptops
2846121 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2846122 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple hotchkies said
2846123 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2846124 jail break because it liberates iphone models from the shackles of deals apple has with telecom giants providing exclusive service to the devices in varying countries
2846125 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software hotchkies said
2846126 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2846127 its one thing to move out in such a hurry but it is quite another to steal things from the house that you moved out of regardless of how insignificant the things you took were
2846128 in my day i carried hand grenades now i carry fruit bars
2846129 no zonca no crying dont let them see you cry dammit
2846130 forget the 192 days inn youre staying in cinderellas castle
2846131 i have been crucified with christ it is no longer i who live but christ lives in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
2846132 i could force you to download child porn or send subversive material to china
2846133 the exploitation is almost limitless google has to fix it
2846134 it turns out a lot of people who develop these things arent good at security
2846135 weve been telling google about these vulnerabilities for years and they have not made corrective actions
2846136 they chose to open the doors and insomuch put a lot of consumers at risk
2846137 we must study to show ourselves approved a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth
2846138 not one of you is going to enter my promised land instead youre going to turn around now you are going back into the wilderness to make another lap around the desert
2846139 lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief
2846140 surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which i sware to give unto your fathers
2846141 shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth luke 18 7 8
2846142 you will spend your years as a tale that is told
2846143 owen travels through it his subject with the elephants grace and solid step if sometimes also with his ungainly motion
2846144 to believe in the power of man in the work of regeneration is the great heresy of rome and from that error has come the ruin of the church conversion proceeds from the grace of god alone and the system which ascribes it partly to man and partly to god is worse than pelagianism
2846145 whatever is laudable in our works proceeds from the grace of god
2846146 ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only
2846147 in the grammar of theology it is proper to proceed according to the meaning of the words not the matter of the words themselves we bring in the sense of them the voice and letter of the spirit
2846148 all scripture is to be interpreted for christ as keep the commandments in christ for without him you can do nothing
2846149 then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet jeremiah saying
2846150 we may now take up the words of the prophet
2846151 on land at sea at home abroad i smoke my pipe and worship god
2846152 whatever is laudable in our works proceeds from the grace of god
2846153 show us your mercy o lord and grant us your salvation
2846154 why wasnt god watching why wasnt god listening why wasnt god there for georgia lee
2846155 i do not think it means what you think it means
2846156 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2846157 this is an extraordinary swing and it underlines the disillusionment australians are seeing and feeling with the lack of leadership from the new federal labor government a government that promised so much
2846158 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2846159 and all weve got is one watch after another fuelwatch grocerywatch and who knows what the next watch exercise will be
2846160 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2846161 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2846162 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2846163 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them i think the lesson from this election as prime minister kevin rudd has said and its a lesson for all politicians is youve always got to be in touch with the electorate and cant take anything for granted
2846164 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2846165 were not through yet but weve taken a break mr mugabe said as he left the talks overnight at a harare hotel being mediated by south african president thabo mbeki

2846171 i also intend to include veterans that were exposed to agent orange in neighboring countries as well as this bill moves forward if this bill passes through congress and the president signs it into law it would ultimately allow all combat veterans exposed to agent orange to get their just and equitable compensation

2846180 this is serious business instead of running ads about britney amp paris they should go talk to some energy experts
2846181 i cant wait i just want to go out and have fun
2846182 todays game was overall not a comfortable game from a personal standpoint
2846183 i knew that barring something like that happening for me i was probably going to go home and have a pretty rough night
2846184 now i can go home and look forward to tomorrow its a nice feeling
2846185 he comes into situations like this and hes just not making pitches
2846186 at first i thought it was going to stay fair for sure then i saw it had kind of had a little lean to it
2846187 i wasnt positive whether it would stay fair im glad it did
2846188 all the time i wait for this kind of moment
2846189 this guy had a no hitter going into the sixth inning without his best stuff
2846190 he ran his pitch count with those five walks but were so happy for this kid weve got a pitcher here hes got four pitches and he can throw them for strikes
2846191 theyre a good team obviously it was a devastating series for us but weve got to rebound
2846192 every game is a playoff from now on weve dug ourselves a huge hole but weve got to come out fighting and play with a lot of urgency weve been in this situation before and were going to show what this team is made of
2846193 i never count that team out but it just shows how well were playing right now
2846194 it starts with the pitching and today we just found a way to score enough runs to win
2846195 its frustrating i hate it that i wasnt able to hold them down better than i did
2846196 they figure out a way to win and thats what good teams do
2846197 it was 100 the right move to make i mean on the road you have to play to win
2846198 i had a good jump the catcher made a perfect throw i stole the base and everyone knows that the umpire had great position on it he just simply missed it
2846199 i thought we had a pickoff play going with richie and there was a serious miscommunication there he was actually talking to alex and alex was probably standing right behind me at third base it screwed up the inning big time
2846200 i mean he could have given up and let the yankees get a few more runs but he stepped up huge and kept us in the game
2846201 i feel like we have a very good lineup from top to bottom and its a complete team effort
2846202 not at all hes fine his hitting is going to come around
2846203 to do it in a situation when we needed a hit and a run is just icing on the cake
2846204 i thought he kept the ball down changed speeds well it was encouraging to see
2846205 i was looking for the oxygen tank at third base
2846206 to get him for me was like milwaukee getting cc sabathia
2846207 hes one of those guys you dont want to see because hes got a tremendous angle on his fastball and a good assortment of pitches i was kind of hoping wed get a little rain take him out play big but it didnt work out that way
2846208 i made some stupid pitches and when i did they made me pay for them uggla came up and swung at the first pitch it was supposed to be down and away and it was up
2846209 every now and then you get lucky and get a base hit
2846210 we have to win as many games as we can the way the division is its crucial for us to keep playing and keep plugging along
2846211 we had a chance to get to him and they got out of it with a double play
2846212 to win three out of four against their pitching staff is pretty good
2846213 theyve got an outstanding staff and getting three is big
2846214 i made some terrible pitches with guys in scoring position
2846215 that first inning went a long way toward getting us moving in the right direction
2846216 early runs and brandon webb on the mound usually ends up being all good in the end
2846217 this is something i will treasure as a memory for the rest of my life
2846218 i played a very good week and today i played unbelievable
2846219 i dont think roddick was 100 percent but i played unbelievable to win i beat tommy robredo last year but to beat roddick in the united states i think is the best win of my career
2846220 its always pretty fun to be able to walk the dodgers off the field
2846221 the intensity that was here in this series and the crowd you could hear them even when we came in after the eighth the sense and feel in the dugout was hey we can do this theyre fighting and thats all you can ask
2846222 its a feeling of if we dont get something started were going to find ourselves in a long september just being so far behind that were not even playing for anything
2846223 we had an opportunity to make something happen with someone in front of us right in our own yard
2846224 were going to have to reach down and reach back its how you come back
2846225 we and russia will have to live with the consequences of russias use of force for a long time to come
2846226 no state has a right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state the obligation to protect people lies with the state in which those individuals are located
2846227 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and that is why it is so important that this doctrine is emphatically dismissed
2846228 bristol and richmond are without a doubt my two favorite tracks on the schedule
2846229 i think we can do well at those two places and get ourselves locked into the chase in the process
2846230 i consider bristol and richmond real racing the kind most of us grew up on
2846231 weve been running pretty well but i really feel comfortable with those two places coming up
2846232 youd like to have things in hand before richmond because it gets a little crazy there when theres so much on the line and its such a tight track and all
2846233 todays game was overall not a comfortable game from a personal standpoint
2846234 i knew that barring something like that happening for me i was probably going to go home and have a pretty rough night
2846235 now i can go home and look forward to tomorrow its a nice feeling
2846236 he comes into situations like this and hes just not making pitches
2846237 at first i thought it was going to stay fair for sure then i saw it had kind of had a little lean to it
2846238 i wasnt positive whether it would stay fair im glad it did
2846239 all the time i wait for this kind of moment
2846240 this guy had a no hitter going into the sixth inning without his best stuff
2846241 he ran his pitch count with those five walks but were so happy for this kid weve got a pitcher here hes got four pitches and he can throw them for strikes

2846269 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
2846270 youre breaking up with me and you cant even give me a proper reason
2846271 well i think that so called reason you just gave me wasnt proper enough
2846272 so you think that this what we had for more than a year almost one and a half year now that i think about it isnt serious enough
2846273 no that is not what i mean it is more complicated than that
2846274 im an adult you are starting your fifth year at school school i have a job there is too much of an age difference between us
2846275 i know but now it seems like i dont want this i dont like this being away from each other and so on and to tell you the truth i want a little bit more freedom you understand how can i ever be happy if my girlfriend lives in another country and i am able to see you like two months in a year and on top of that all you should be with someone else someone like my brother someone your own age
2846276 the truth is christophe that i dont want to be with your brother i want to be with you
2846277 oh okay so err oh yeah whats your favourite animal and where does it come from
2846278 christophe who by the way broke up with me half an hour ago got it for me from the zoo artis in amsterdam when he was there for his work
2846279 who did you think then a death eater in disguise
2846280 you have to take me to leahs with side along apparition
2846281 because a im your daughter and im asking you for a favour and b because i cant use the floo network to get to her place because her parents have decided to block their fireplace because you know who has returned
2846282 yes i know that so just apparate at the square in front of their house
2846283 so if that is true what did i get you for your 15th birthday
2846284 maybe you should just be glad that he broke up with you he sounds like a real loser
2846285 but then i remembered again how great and gorgeous and marvellous and fabulous he really is
2846286 jools has just broken up with her boyfriend and she realty doesnt want to hear about all you happy stuff and so on
2846287 tell me alice cheer me up if you can anyway
2846288 his names carlos and hes spanish and he is so cool
2846289 but why this christmas already isnt that a bit early for your doing
2846290 well we first wanted to do it summer next year but that brat of a flear delacour is going to marry too then and i heard her talking about it in diagon alley and it looks like she wants almost the same wedding as i want and i dont want people to think that i stole her ideas
2846291 whats fleur delacour doing in diagon alley discussing her marriage
2846292 so basically the only thing that will be different is that she will have french guests and i will have spanish guests and that my wedding will be in spain
2846293 this is jools by the way and jools this is carlos
2846294 well it has only been one hour at least give me some time to grieve
2846295 actually i know something that might cheer you up a little for now
2846296 i was just wondering if you wanted to be one of my bridesmaids
2846297 but dont you want sophie and anna to be your bridesmaids
2846298 well anna is too busy living in america and with her job and so on so she doesnt really have time to come and ive lost touch with sophie so merlin knows where she is and besides its great to have you and leah i mean leah represents my side also known as the english side and you with your foreign looks which are quite the opposite of leahs will represent the spanish side
2846299 and you being made a prefect i can understand but jesse there must have been a mistake im absolutely certain
2846300 you have no idea how happy that makes me feel
2846301 i just thought that you hang out with dan way too often to be you know a normal person who knows what rules are and so on
2846302 i think i have a rather good influence on him thank you very much
2846303 that doesnt make me feel like a dog at all
2846304 are you sure you dont want to come down to eat something
2846305 you dont have to take that tone with me you know
2846306 its not my fault that you got dumped so you could be a little nicer to me
2846307 i know i could be a little nicer to you and i know that i dont have to drown in sorrow right now but that i just have to pick up my life again where i left off the only thing is isabelle that christophe was my life and now that he isnt here anymore he has practically taken my life with me and even if he feels sorry or whatever he doesnt have to come to me and start rambling about that it is all for the best and so on because he has now officially ruined my life the only thing i have to do now is find another reason to live and then move on but that really isnt that easy so isabelle i dont care if youve come to make me feel better or whatever just leave me alone okay
2846308 you dont love someone because theyre perfect you love them in spite of the fact that theyre not
2846309 family members believe at this point it is a medical condition that might have led to his death
2846310 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities

2846330 how can i improve my code homemade php application framework
2846331 i thought it was just a normal crash then i couldnt lift my arm
2846332 he threatened staff for cash and got away with an undisclosed amount of money
2846333 he walked in and said give us your money and one of the staff members said youre joking and thats when the second offender produced a hand gun
2846334 they were in there for about 30 seconds and had it over and done with
2846335 he is no doubt very distressed by the whole thing and very upset but i can say he has handled himself very well throughout the whole thing
2846336 he didnt interfere with their demands and didnt put himself at any more risk than what he was put at by the offenders themselves
2846337 they were last seen fleeing on foot but experience tells us a car was used and we are appealing for witnesses who were in the area at that time who may have seen any cars speeding or burning out
2846338 when measured across the state from the toughest streets in melbourne to the quietest country towns 66 5 per cent of victorians felt safe walking at night compared with only 61 1 per cent of ballarat residents
2846339 likewise where ballarat recorded 6649 crimes against property per 100 000 population geelong recorded 4739 and bendigo only 4433 similar offences
2846340 the police association have expressed concerns that ballarat is 98 officers short of the levels needed to provide adequate policing
2846341 victoria police has analysed the figures and methodology of the data collection and believes there is inaccuracies in the way the data has been interpreted and is therefore misleading
2846342 ballarat police continue to provide a high level of service to the community and if residents have any safety concerns they are encouraged to contact their local police
2846343 victoria police will release its official crime figures in the near future
2846344 given the very cold mornings we are having people need to be extra careful and drive to the conditions whether it be icy or raining or foggy
2846345 of late we have also had ice in the middle of town it can occur anywhere at any time of day whether it be in the morning or even when we get a cold snap in the middle of the afternoon
2846346 our heritage isnt as long as the british army but its important we have an example of the past we value that strongly and its reflected here today and the fact they have commemorated their history going back 150 years
2846347 its important we trace our history and its important for our soldiers to know they have a history and where they have come from
2846348 i think its a great privilege to command australian soldiers especially with a unit like this that has such a great history
2846349 without the soldiers you dont have the tradition you dont have the spirit they are the core and the whole essence of the battalion
2846350 the 2008 results show that council is holding the strong position we have been working to build up to over previous years
2846351 in terms of our median overall result moorabool performed exactly in line on comparison with other councils in our group
2846352 would stretch from here to the hillendale golf course and every shape and size rv secrets 2
2846353 ironically our biggest advance this year was with a plane that didnt fly
2846354 next year well be emphasizing fuel efficiency as the ultimate goal with planes that maintain the characteristics of practical aircraft
2846355 the push to develop a diesel engine is worthy because of the limited availability of aviation leaded fuels
2846356 nos altres no estem per fer caure el govern de zapatero al rev s estem perqu duri molt de temps i reculli molts xits per aix tamb dep n de la seva capacitat per respondre als compromisos adquirits i de des envolupar lestatut
2846357 home la cosa no es mou com abans per arribarem al nostre objectiu en un termini de 6 o 7 anys
2846358 el pla no estar acabat fins daqu a uns tres anys
2846359 tal com van arribar van haver de marxar cap a casa la cosa est molt malament

2846362 tota la vida aqu i no havia vist mai una cosa aix sembla que el poble estigui en venda
2846363 els andalusos i els gallecs saben b de solidaritat i de laportaci que van haver de fer perqu espanya progress s
2846364 el govern ha mogut pe a i ho ha fet en una bona direcci en funci del que diu lestatut dandalusia i el de catalunya
2846365 necessitem molts m s diners i m s recursos i lindicador de refer ncia ha de ser el de la poblaci real
2846366 hem rebut amb una grand ssima satisfacci la not cia de la prestigiosa operaci dels investigadors de n pols en estreta col laboraci amb les forces policials espanyoles que ha portat fins a la detenci del fugitiu patrizio bosti dirigent del clan camorrista ricciardi contini
2846367 s molt dif cil viure sense ell per el meu marit i jo no tenim opci
2846368 estic molt contenta aviat anir a la xina i podr veure per fi el meu nen
2846369 per als emigrants xinesos la feina s el primer v nen aqu a fundar un negoci s n conscients del preu que sha de pagar per aconseguir un futur a espanya per aconseguir ho estan disposats a treballar totes les hores que faci falta
2846370 en la fase dassentament quan arriben a espanya els xinesos tenen assumit que han de treballar per a altres xinesos gaireb en r gim dexplotaci per poder estalviar diners i m s tard obrir el seu propi negoci
2846371 quan el marit i la dona treballen des del mat fins a la mitjanit s inviable que socupin dun nad
2846372 vaig estar 10 anys sense poder veure el meu fill
2846373 vaig arribar a espanya un dissabte a les dotze del migdia aquell mateix dia a les set del vespre ja vaig entrar a treballar en un restaurant xin s
2846374 vaig creure que la gent seria prou honesta per veurem com alg que estava intentant fer el b
2846375 la meva mare sempre em va ensenyar que havia de dir alguna cosa bona o no dir res per ara crec que vaig confiar massa en la gent
2846376 ens ho vam passar tan b va ser com en els vells temps
2846377 me preocupa el olor del envejecimiento y saber hay productos para combatir el olor y del tipo anti envejecimiento pero no los he comprado
2846378 cada vez m s se est n convirtiendo las personas a preocuparse por su olor corporal
2846379 jap n se est convirtiendo a la tendencia hacia limpieza y una sociedad sin olor y el nombre kareishu es el rotulo que define esa tendencia de estos tiempos
2846380 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
2846381 what other way is there to hold institutions such as this accountable when they do the wrong thing would not this behavior continue without drawing attention to it
2846382 there was nothing to provoke this kind of reaction freddy was a good boy who has never done anything wrong
2846383 people want to know if they werent armed why such force
2846384 weve seen many cases where blacks and other minorities have been shot for no reason people are angry but more than that they want answers
2846385 you can see where the glass was smashed on the police car
2846386 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2846387 you have to get focused and give it a go
2846388 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2846389 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2846390 i dont think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that
2846391 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
2846392 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
2846393 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
2846394 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families
2846395 because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
2846396 thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
2846397 desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity
2846398 that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expense of the american family for decades weve had politicians in washington who talk about family values but we havent had policies that value families instead its harder for working parents to make a living while raising their kids its even harder to get a break
2846399 i believe the most significant reason is the difference in profile before they get to the olympics
2846400 gold medals typically get some awareness and attention in canada
2846401 it doesnt mean its a bag of riches for them that is for very few athletes in this country
2846402 ive seen deals that bring maybe 50 to 100 per cent more dollars to the winter athletes
2846403 its a challenge for a lot of the summer olympians
2846404 how many people are kayakers how many are trampolinists all the summer disciplines are difficult to identify with
2846405 and i suspect that if they had a chance to increase budgets they would be spending more in vancouver not splitting it
2846406 i told him this would be my last 400 im he said it has to end on a record in my opinion that was my last one
2846407 i mean this is the tiger woods of swimming here hes a superstar hes one of a kind and at the same time he makes everybody else better by going after him
2846408 i wanted to sing on the medal podium then i started crying
2846409 it was everything that happened ryan lochte is coming on like a freight train i was happy to get the first one under my belt
2846410 at 6 30 this morning i was going to the pool at the village and i said to bowman ive got to break 4 05
2846411 were going to get there brian johns in the 400 metre im heats that was the ninth fastest time in history and the womens 4x100 relay team is the seventh fastest time ever were pretty good thats how good this meet is
2846412 when you see that you want to be there too
2846413 if it looks too good to be true it probably is
2846414 almost always people who are on fixed incomes the people who dont have a lot of disposable income
2846415 theyll cash the check which is a crime and wire a portion of money they dont really have
2846416 against their better judgment they hope its legitimate or that they wont get in trouble
2846417 initially its disbelief it can range from embarrassment to anger to frustration in finding out that youve been taken advantage of
2846418 you really have to work hard to tell if its a fake check a lot of these checks do look real
2846419 it takes a little bit of extra effort and time but its worth it
2846420 story is about principles not rules a rule says you must do it this way a principle says this works and has through all remembered time the difference is crucial your work neednt be modeled after the well made play rather it must be well made within the principles that shape our art anxious inexperienced writers obey rules rebellious unschooled writers break rules artists master the form
2846421 one day your life will flash before your eyes make sure its worth watching
2846422 hurry up im starving im not like you who can fill up just by drinking blood
2846423 hurry up or were going to be late for our appointment with lucky

2846433 blue like sapphire beneath a morning sun burning with passionate soul a laughter that never quite reaches inside where secrets weather touched gold
2846434 do you want to look through the menu or are you ready for me to take your orders
2846435 ok youre right its just that i never would have imagined use together you know

2846502 a vegades lhem de calmar s massa lluitador i agressiu el fet de casar se i tenir una filla li ha anat molt b per al car cter
2846503 tenir el cap fred compta molt en aquest esport la medalla ha arribat en el millor moment perqu diuen que entre els 27 i els 33 anys s la millor edat

2846506 police are still investigating the deadly shooting that brought the west indian festival and parade to a screeching halt
2846507 this is the first incident thats happened in the 30 years of the event so were taking it very seriously
2846508 optimists believe this is the best of all possible worlds pessimists fear that it is true
2846509 i love my dog but my doctor say we cannot make babies i guess well adopt children and just have sechs
2846510 the individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the group if you try it you will be lonely often and sometimes frightened but no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself
2846511 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2846512 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2846513 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2846514 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2846515 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2846516 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2846517 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of cheques with our show making fun of christians
2846518 the statistics have been derived from the narrative of 142 victims who were counselled by women psychologists each of the survivors was in counselling with us for at least six months
2846519 the more recent cases show a greater degree of violence during the rapes in several cases victims are battered and bruised
2846520 for instance a victim might switch on the tv and pretend to be watching a programme so that everybody in the family thinks she is back to her usual self
2846521 in some cases the perpetrator had given indications of coming back this is what had caused the fear
2846522 a victim might switch on the television and pretend to be watching a programme so that everybody in the family thinks she is back to her usual self and leave her alone
2846523 in some cases the perpetrator had given indications of coming back this is what had caused the fear
2846524 they felt an intense sense of disbelief and horror at what someone was doing to them many had difficulty explaining why they could not shout or scream and described as if their voice had frozen at that time although they could feel an inner resistance against the offender
2846525 which is why many victims also faced difficulty explaining to the police and the court why they did not shout or raise their voice the truth is that not being able to scream during a threatening event happens with many victims during counselling when the victims were told about this they felt better
2846526 at the police station itself often a survivor is made to relive the incident several times
2846527 this will stop a victim from having to relive the nightmare before different officials
2846528 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2846531 i approached the commission after utiamc replied that all its three entities uti mutual funds uti trustee company and uti asset management company do not fall under the ambit of the rti act
2846532 even though the entire share capital of utiamc is held by four public sector banks utiamc is a company registered under the companies act and is neither financed by the government nor controlled by it
2846533 in other words utiamc is owned by four public authorities an institution wholly owned by a public authority could be considered to be a public authority under the rti act
2846534 from the purpose and object of the rti act it is crystal clear that there should be transparency in the functioning of any institution in which public money is deployed

2846543 russia certainly demonstrated its capacity for good timing when it decided to make war against georgia on the same day that the olympics began in beijing i dont know specifics about the balance of forces between russia and georgia but my gut tells me that while the russian military outclasses the georgian one it isnt by much and the experience of recent russian military adventures informs us that perhaps just perhaps moscow might have chosen yet again to get over its head militarily
2846544 bush really premised so much of our foreign policy on his personal relationships with leaders and i just dont think thats the way a great country engages in diplomacy this is the president that looked in the soul of putin and i could have told him he was a kgb agent by definition he doesnt have a soul i mean this is a waste of time right this is nonsense but this is the world were living in right now

2846560 anyone who says i love god and hates his brother is a liar since a person who does not love the brother that he can see cannot love god whom he has never seen so this is the commandment that he has given us that anyone who loves god must also love his brother

2846607 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honor to play in it
2846608 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
2846609 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey

2846616 we expect solid organic growth as we build upon our strong position in our core markets and expand into new ones
2846617 we remain well placed to benefit from record spending in essential infrastructure in the asia pacific region ongoing growth in the australian resources sector and the global trend for outsourcing of non core services
2846618 we are mindful of global economic uncertainty and the challenging cost environment but barring any unforeseen factors our current forecasts suggest another year of double digit earnings growth in 2009
2846619 our balance sheet is stronger than ever and we continue our bias towards lower risk alliance contracts and blue chip partners

2846622 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2846623 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2846624 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2846625 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing

2846629 nos interesaba utilizar la gen tica para reconstruir la historia de estas poblaciones por dos razones
2846630 para documentar el proceso de mestizaje de la regi n y para identificar los genes de las enfermedades m s frecuentes en los ind genas americanos
2846631 ste afirman los autores en la revista plos genetics es el estudio de mestizaje m s amplio que se ha hecho en latinoam rica hasta el momento
2846632 encontramos por ejemplo que hay una variaci n muy grande en la proporci n de la ascendencia ind gena en las distintas regiones
2846633 pero quiz s lo m s novedoso de la investigaci n afirma andr s ruiz linares es que pudimos evaluar la cercan a gen tica de las poblaciones mestizas con determinados grupos ind genas
2846634 pudimos ver claramente que los mestizos mexicanos tienen un componente gen tico muy cercano de la poblaci n ind gena de m xico
2846635 y ste es muy diferente al componente ind gena de los mestizos chilenos que se acerca m s a los ind genas aimaras
2846636 en las grandes aglomeraciones urbanas como por ejemplo la ciudad de m xico hay una heterogeneidad enorme
2846637 algunos individuos tienen un componente ind gena muy alto y otros un componente europeo muy alto agrega pero las poblaciones m s peque as son mucho m s homog neas
2846638 el mejor ejemplo es la diabetes tipo 2 explica el investigador que tiene una frecuencia muy alta en la poblaci n latinoamericana
2846639 parece que el pez utiliza los cortos veranos ant rticos para ganar suficiente energ a a trav s de la alimentaci n para pasar el invierno
2846640 este estado parecido a la hibernaci n es presumiblemente un mecanismo para reducir sus requerimientos de energ a al m nimo
2846641 la pregunta interesante que a n tenemos que responder es por qu esos peces comen mucho menos en el invierno a pesar de que disponen de mucho alimento a su alrededor
2846642 nos sorprendi que el impacto fuese tan grande para un per odo tan corto
2846643 con lo que sabemos ahora vale la pena evaluar a los pacientes que tienen problemas para dormir

2846646 i thought man im feeling exactly the way he feels
2846647 thats a guy you love to coach because when you tell him something he takes it to heart he takes it personal
2846648 those are the guys who usually are the good players because theyve got the intangibles in life that some other guys dont have he certainly has those qualities
2846649 the desire to beat the other person off the ball
2846650 we all think hell be an all american by the end of the season
2846651 the first morning we got it he shared his cereal with it
2846652 i think at first i tried to talk her out of it but i am willing to try anything to help might make it easier
2846653 the flights are ongoing to redeploy the elements of the georgian contingent so that they can deal with the security issues in their country
2846654 we can accommodate that obviously it was not expected but it is something the effects of which we can certainly mitigate
2846655 creo que es muy importante que convirtamos este proyecto en un verdadero xito comercial
2846656 si lo logramos creo que estaremos desbloqueando esa pared que levant el sector privado frente a los lanzamientos espaciales y la tecnolog a espacial
2846657 esto podr a compararse a las escalas de inversiones que se volcaron en las tecnolog as de tel fonos celulares e internet cuando pasaron del mbito militar al privado
2846658 el hecho de que este sistema sea capaz de transportar a la vez turistas y sat lites a bajo costo es de una importancia tremenda
2846659 we had two scoreboards that had been there for some time and the 16 000 light bulbs of which they consisted needed constant replacement we also had a temporary video screen which was brought in for major matches so when we decided to replace the two scoreboards the decision was made to add a third and set them all up to be capable of showing video
2846660 this was a fantastic project to be involved with that really delivers the first truly end to end amx solution and demonstrates the real value behind amxs continuing strategy of integrating end to end solutions with our technology portfolio it was also a great opportunity to work with lighthouse leds and extend our signage solution into this arena
2846661 every american to be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2846662 this system is so badly broken it cannot be repaired
2846663 we cant fix the health care problem by selling more insurance
2846664 each one of us could make a documentary we have so many tragic stories
2846665 we know what works social security works medicare works we want to extend it to all americans
2846666 theres not democratic health care discrimination and republican health care discrimination theyre all catching hell
2846667 i feel sorry for any legislator who legislates like that you show go into something else
2846668 how the hell did they fit everything in that tiny little 2 room apartment and the only piece of furniture they have is that one small 3 drawer dresser that never seems to be full because they can hide big packages in there for each other and they have no couch or even comfy chair to sit in and no tv
2846669 our emergency room teams efforts to resuscitate him were not successful and our hearts go out to his family and legion of fans worldwide
2846670 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2846671 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2846672 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2846673 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2846674 i am shocked we have lost not only an incredible talent but a wonderful leader to his community and a dear friend
2846675 isaac hayes was our emissary to the world for over four decades his music and his love of his fellow man transcended all racial boundaries his contributions to this city and its culture were many and his friends were even more numerous
2846676 isaac was unique and an inspiration to us all his accomplishments as a musician are unparalleled but more than that he was a very dear friend and great supporter of the soulsville foundation mission particularly the work we do with children we will miss him and his wonderful presence more than we can convey at this time

2846678 the impairment adjustments will flow through to our full year earnings and combined with the ongoing deterioration in global markets will mean that babcock amp browns 2008 earnings are now not expected to exceed 2007 group net profit of 643 million
2846679 we will look to provide more detail on the 2008 outlook with our interim result to be reported on 21 august 2008
2846680 i gave it my all unfortunately sometimes things dont want to go the right way
2846681 the vice president praised president saakashvili for his governments restraint offers of cease fire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country
2846682 the vice president told president saakashvili that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2846683 you just have to take it on and give it a go
2846684 when i started making putts i just stuck in there and it brought my game up the more i got into it the better i played
2846685 i was comfortable with my game in winning the open this week i havent been as confident and comfortable but i knew i had the ability to win if i got a chance
2846686 inflation has reached 4 5 per cent yet paramedics are being offered annual increases of 3 25 per cent basically theyre being offered a pay cut how can they accept that
2846687 hoped to see a considerable amount of progress in the next four weeks
2846688 certainly i would think in the next four to five weeks if there has been little progress i think were left with no choice but to go to the industrial relations commission and mount a case for putting industrial action to a ballot of our members
2846689 the ultimate action would be stop work action if it got to a serious point
2846690 in our earlier study areas of stress were largely located at the outer suburban mortgage belts where car dependency is high
2846691 in this study we have seen the number and geographical range of vulnerable households creep inwards as fuel costs and interest rates rise
2846692 worse the deficits in urban infrastructure and services meant the more vulnerable households had less ability to adapt to higher fuel costs by taking public transport
2846693 across australias cities public transport is bursting at the seams during peak hour which gives clear evidence people will use public transport when it becomes just too costly not to
2846694 state governments nationwide are debating measures such as underground loops and light rail which is great but will only assist inner urban residents who are already the least vulnerable in society we need to get new trains and buses into our outer suburbs
2846695 since world war ii australias cities have been planned on the presumption that cars running on low priced fuel would be the dominant means of transportation
2846696 the australian senate estimates peak oil to occur by 2030 so a broad comprehensive plan to reconstruct australian suburbs to reduce petrol reliance must begin now

2846700 hi holly thanks so much for sharing and maya again thanks for inviting me to participate in this show i am truly loving this discussion via the comments so thanks to to pippa for bringing it up
2846701 i mean really can i paint another bear or a bird
2846702 is this my true inspiration and is this something that will sell
2846703 we are aware of this matter and necessary measures have been taken against them
2846704 we have clear guidelines for all employees in funcom not least those who work with customer service and if the guidelines are broken leads to the consequences
2846705 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all

2846710 some of the things theyve been working on throughout the year are the exhibit areas we try to keep it affordable
2846711 the plan is basically aimed at the working uninsured people that maybe work two or three jobs with no health insurance
2846712 after our millage 75 a household spread across the county
2846713 now we have over 67 of the uninsured covered in genesee county its a great program
2846714 but they have access to healthcare to basic affordable healthcare
2846715 these results demonstrate the continued rise of the greens in australian politics
2846716 it also demonstrates the greens are a credible alternative to the two old parties as voters increasingly embrace the policies and energy of the greens
2846717 the for itself is what it is not and is not what it is
2846718 universal essence that can be called human nature there is nevertheless a human universality of condition
2846719 nearly 80 per cent of people do their shopping in supermarkets
2846720 although native flavours are starting to appear in chutneys sauces and spice blends you wont find crocodile meat in the cold cabinet or lemon myrtle on the spice rack let alone fresh warrigal greens or kakadu plums alongside the salad mix and packham pears
2846721 theres a difference between experiencing something unique once and putting it on the weekly shopping list
2846722 research shows that we gravitate to flavours that taste the most familiar
2846723 with such conservative palates australians are not going to embrace challenging new native flavours

2846792 from milk toast internationalist to brave mccain like warrior in under 24 hours mccain on crisis in georgia updates
2846793 its particularly a moment where john mccain can claim to have been prescient
2846794 david broder is this a 3 a m moment for foreign policy for these candidates
2846795 it is and its particularly a moment where john mccain can claim to have been prescient because in his basic foreign policy speech two months ago and in an interview that i did with him last week he draws a very sharp line when it comes to russia he says these people are being aggressive and imperialist there is no confusion in his mind about the character of the putin medvedev government and he is prepared i think to make the case that this is a demonstration of exactly what he has been arguing for
2846796 appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
2846797 when violence broke out in the caucasus friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position it has been a rough few weeks for mccain on the foreign policy front paging dr maliki but he appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
2846798 its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks
2846799 and its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks hes been in contact with the leaders involved in these places for many many years so its really sort of a perfect thing for him and so the question is each time something like this pops up randomly we may see a cautiousness on the one hand by senator obama who has not been dealing with these things for years and maybe a little more aggressive voice from senator mccain and ill just tell you his favorite thing to say about vladimir putin is when i look into his eyes i see a k a g and a b hes been very very tough on putin for quite some time
2846800 mccain was right about putin he warned about russia under putins ambitions he wanted russia excluded from the g 8
2846801 certainly their initial responses they were as you say different mr obamas initial response was to say that both should show restraint the invader and the invaded thats not whats going on here
2846802 certainly their initial responses they were as you say different mr obamas initial response was to say that both should show restraint the invader and the invaded thats not whats going on here what is going on here is an enormous world historic moment ballistic missiles according to the united states administration including plus a naval blockade tanks heavy artillery and strategic bombers operating by russia against a european nation
2846803 i know from my own reporting he does understand whats happening in that region hes been in georgia i know hes met with opposition leaders in georgia
2846804 mccain came out strong against russia almost as soon as the crisis in the caucasus ignited now more world leaders are there including bush and obama whose new statement casts the blame more clearly
2846805 the mindless slaughters being conducted by a russian military that seeks to reassert itself not only in the former soviet union but also to extend its reach throughout what used to be the former soviet union in an attempt to fold back into the russian empire those countries that have broken away from it most notably georgia
2846806 first lets talk about chechnya the chechen people are now subjected to a level of slaughter and massacre that we have not seen in europe perhaps since world war ii the mindless slaughters being conducted by a russian military that seeks to reassert itself not only in the former soviet union but also to extend its reach throughout what used to be the former soviet union in an attempt to fold back into the russian empire those countries that have broken away from it most notably georgia which is headed by one the great men in the history of the world mr shevardnadze also t his obviously has a great effect on the next election in russia the russian prime minister now is playing this to a great political gain the russians must be told that they will not only not be anymore imf funding there will not be any more export import funding and the united states will gauge its relations on the treatment of the chechnans because what is happening right now is an unconscionable set of circumstances which if allowed to continue will then encourage russia and the military to continue to this kind of expansion into the region and overthrow the embryonic nations that are there the russians have to understand that this is not something that we can turn a blind eye to and we must have it stopped otherwise it will have severe implications for our relations for years to come
2846807 im very concerned about mr putin im afraid mr putin might be one of those who wants to make the trains run on time
2846808 senator would you meet with assuming mr putin is elected in march would you want to meet with him as a candidate other candidates have gone overseas while running for office or right before the campaign begins
2846809 im not sure that would be necessary might be an interesting experience because i know whats going on in russia so do a whole lot of my friends well we know he was a apparatchik we know he was a member of the kgb we know that he came to power because of the military brutality and massacre that is taking place in russia today i mean in chechnya today we know that he worked a deal with yeltsin so that yeltsin would have immunity and he would be assured the presidency rather than basically a contested im very concerned abo ut mr putin im afraid mr putin might be one of those who wants to make the trains run on time so yeah i would meet with him as a candidate but i think that what i would really like to do is send a message to mr putin that we expect certain behavior out of the russians and particularly whats going on in chechnya today a cessation of that brutality and that its a very important strategic part of the world for us

2846813 we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates
2846814 but if interest rates were to fall then we would expect the banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2846815 elders future will be built around its core network network related and complementary operations
2846816 we have evaluated assets and operations which are peripheral to that or which are unlikely to meet our performance targets
2846817 work is ongoing on other elements of the strategy enunciated by the board with the intention of further divestment of non core assets and realisation of capital within the current financial year
2846818 i had a run and i went underneath him and he just didnt give me a whole lot of room
2846819 maybe i shouldnt have been in there but were racing hard to stay in the top 35 in owner points and try to get back into the top 35 thats what we needed to do with our car
2846820 its unfortunate and im sorry for the fans and all the cars that got wrecked there and then they had to wait through that red flag i was just racing hard and really it doesnt look much different than how it was with kyle busch and jeff burton yesterday but im sure theyll make a big deal out of it
2846821 i just cant thank toyota enough i cant thank the guys at joe gibbs racing it was fun to be able to race out there and i had a great time racing with my friend and teammate tony stewart there im really going to miss seeing him at the end of the year and wish he would have stayed
2846822 i knew he was going to be tough to beat i was racing against the same stuff so i knew it was going to be hard
2846823 i thought yesterday was great but when i wound up there on that red flag i realized where i was
2846824 i was behind tony and in front of all those other great drivers we came up out of the truck so well yesterday in practice we were too scared to change anything and the car was flopping around a lot during the race
2846825 it had a lot of grip it was just real tough to drive so i just tried to stay clean as best i could there and pass cars cleanly and just pick away at it you know i really had no idea where we were at until the last pit stops we cycled through about sixth place so its just a great day all along
2846826 we got a little messed up on the second pitstop
2846827 im not sure about what happened the pitstop itself was ok but the pit stall that we were in screwed us up a little bit and we lost some spots
2846828 when you have to go back out and pass five or six guys that youve already passed you just kill your brakes and makes it hard to run good laps other than that we had a really clean race
2846829 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2846830 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2846831 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2846832 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2846833 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2846834 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2846835 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2846836 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2846837 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
2846838 well see where they are tomorrow its still an evaluation stage were going to take a good look at this tape and see where we go with the quarterbacks
2846839 we were in much better position we put pressure on the quarterback all day long and those are good things
2846840 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2846841 hayes was about to begin work on a new album for stax the soul record label he helped build hot buttered soul
2846842 activities in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
2846843 i think that god used this tragedy to strengthen our faith i truly believe that
2846844 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2846845 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2846846 the vice president expressed the with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2846847 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2846848 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2846849 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2846850 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2846851 to try to go ahead with the fight against poverty or it could just entrench the situation further
2846852 not yet we are not through but we will continue tomorrow
2846853 best temporary measure to extricate the country from its worst situation
2846854 how does a western country publicly pronounce that they will not recognize a government unless it is led by a particular leader without undermining the credibility and integrity of that individual
2846855 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2846856 you have to get focused and give it a go
2846857 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2846858 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2846859 i turned to my caddie on 16 and said god this is a lot of fun just to watch
2846860 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2846861 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2846862 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever

2846867 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2846868 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
2846869 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2846870 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2846871 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on
2846872 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on an unprecedented scale
2846873 i cant wait i just want to go out and have fun
2846874 the last time i had five dunks in a game i was 17 thats all because of the energy of this crowd
2846875 the atmosphere here is great and that helps a lot
2846876 i was very comfortable with my game there here that wasnt the case i wasnt happy with the way i was swinging something had me a little off once i holed a few putts it was a question of adrenaline keeping me focused keeping me pushing ahead
2846877 the only thing i know from experience is that no one goes without making a mistake in a major
2846878 i knew if i could hang in there i would get my opportunity and if it happened i would take the opportunity
2846879 i knew if i holed this putt i win the pga
2846880 i shot 69 68 on a tough sunday at a major
2846881 so im pretty happy about that unfortunately i obviously came up a little bit short the only thing i can do now is go home with my head up high and keep working on it i felt like i gave it my best i felt like i responded well he was obviously very good on the back nine and things just happened his way
2846882 i think i am playing very good and my confidence is very very high
2846883 i hope to be good for the u s open because its the most important tournament of the rest off the year
2846884 all in all its been a good week for me
2846885 considering that i hit on sunday for about 15 minutes and wasnt sure if i would even be able to play let alone win its been good
2846886 i have got a few matches in hopefully i can build on this in washington next week and then go to the u s open with enough matches under my belt
2846887 i played a very good week and today i played unbelievable
2846888 i dont think roddick was 100 percent but i played unbelievable to win i beat tommy robredo last year but to beat roddick in the united states i think is the best win of my career
2846889 in reality conservatives and liberals need each other conservatives maintain many lines that should never be crossed while liberals destroy many lines that should never have existed
2846890 desde que vi santoro em cena sabia que ele faria muito sucesso
2846891 it is incredibly sad to hear how many youngsters are bullied or isolated for not having the same clothes or accessories as their classmates
2846892 a lot of advertising companies blatantly target children without any consideration for the parents of those children
2846893 they need to be up to date otherwise they get left out and have low self esteem
2846894 it is often the children who you would expect to have least such as a family on benefits who have all the branded stuff and tease others
2846895 schools and colleges should be places where all children feel equal but it is virtually impossible for schools to protect their pupils from the harsher aspects of these commercial influences

2846951 the vice president praised president saakashvili for his governments restraint offers of cease fire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country
2846952 the vice president told president saakashvili that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

2846958 allaah has forgiven my ummah for mistakes and forgetfulness and what they are forced to do

2846960 a fascinating portrait of aisha child bride of the prophet muhammad who overcame great obstacles to reach her full potential as a woman and a leader
2846961 we thought it was not a good time with tensions running as high as they do to publish this
2846962 in my opinion dr sebastian charles is an idiot yeah you can quote me c u d d y
2846963 it wasnt as good a day as the six previous but weve been going at it for seven straight days and we were bound to have a dip the test is what we do in the morning in full pads in practice number eight
2846964 you are going to have ups and downs you cant have terrible days and this wasnt one of those
2846965 the tempo wasnt what we need to get enough progress we need better carryover from the meeting rooms to the field than we saw today weve got about 80 percent of our package installed and theres no doubt that a lot of the young guys are thinking too much and that hopefully works itself out with time
2846966 well get todays practice back we have to make up the ground we didnt cover well enough today
2846967 the players knew it the bulk of this team is mature enough to handle that reality and know what we have to do
2846968 now that looked good we moved the ball down the field pretty nice
2846969 lets face it the guys not in great shape hes old hes constantly bleeding but because he can bilocate i mean that just doesnt seem fair i could be miles ahead of him and then boop there he is in front of me at the finish line
2846970 me and that donkey jawbone will give them what for
2846971 the government spent about 45 million buying up water and the biggest water grab was from the lachlan where not one drop will reach the lower lakes at the mouth of the murray even in a good year
2846972 they had almost 1000 offers to sell water and pursued about 120 of those for 34 gl
2846973 the government doesnt have a plan for this buyback that wont be ready until 2011
2846974 it means theres no idea about targets in terms of water purchases this seems ridiculous
2846975 without a plan theres no benchmark and how do they know theyre buying water from the right areas
2846976 theres no plan about what theyre buying or why accept that its for the environment and obviously they have bought the cheapest water possible hence the lachlan which has had virtually no irrigation for five years
2846977 rather than running around spending millions of dollars buying water and destroying communities they should be making sure infrastructure and water monitoring and metering is up to scratch to avoid water losses so we know where the water is and where its being used
2846978 by far the most extraordinary thing is that there is currently no structural adjustment package for rural communities who stand to lose their lifeblood and economic driver which is water
2846979 de haber conocido antes lo que aqu se ha hecho lo hubiera aplicado en el resto del pa s

2846984 many actually believe quite simply that things have to be the way they are if this should happen to mean that they are obliged to commit injustice then they believe that others are responsible for this reason i am convinced that it is still best that i speak the truth even if it costs my life these few words are being set down here as they come from my mind and heart and if i must write them with my hands in chains i find that much better than if my will were in chains

2846990 i cant wait i just want to go out and have fun
2846991 adjusting and constantly evolving expanding and trying to stay as young as i can
2846992 could use a little more substance like we had in the day
2846993 theyre standing on our shoulders some of them dont realize it because they sample me so much
2846994 i started to walk out i thought it was a disney thing i had never heard of this thing
2846995 toward the opening i started having trepidations oh my god what have i done ive ruined my career but when it aired the ratings went through the roof

2846998 everybody is trying to stop the title record stores are gonna have a problem in this day and time selling a record with that title who knows whats gonna turn out and be on that title who knows what that title will be
2846999 im sorry but when someone calls you something that ignorant and that offensive you have to bash their head in with a microphone
2847000 we may not buy it ourselves but we can find investors who will be interested in buying it these could be investors who believe in our vision for the company or like minded people so to say
2847001 let the ranbaxy daiichi deal settle down we can discuss it after that
2847002 that is a pure commercial arrangement that we have with any of our customers and partners around the world
2847003 we should have at least two new molecules by 2010 which can then be licenced to other manufacturers

2847005 over the next two years the company will be putting in 2 billion for setting up nationwide gsm network we are rolling out the network very quickly wherever we have been given spectrum so far
2847006 we do understand that there are security concerns in some of the states circles where spectrum cannot be allocated but wherever it is available there should not be any delay as the government had earlier announced in january this year that enough spectrum is available in most of the circles to accommodate all the new players as well to meet the needs of the existing operators
2847007 microsoft as a company has shaped the evolution of the global computing industry over the past 30 years and is poised to play a leading role in the coming decade too i am thrilled to be joining the microsoft india team at such an exciting time

2847009 ive known her for years besides she is also a cousin and i completely trust her choice
2847010 it was one of those conventional houses with arches everywhere
2847011 but i wanted something that was more contemporary plainer and with clean lines
2847012 the arches are covered with solid wrought iron pillars over which there is a layer of plywood and on top of which is what you see outside slats of seasoned teakwood coated with pu and melamine
2847013 instead of iron i used moulded stainless steel because it is more new age and weathers better
2847014 i didnt want to put in a solid partition it would have cut space whereas i want to build on space
2847015 i couldnt do much with it so i simply made this
2847016 these are just pieces of wood that ive cut and stuck together it has an interesting texture and makes a change from the usual paintings on the wall
2847017 rajshree and i picked up that over sized copper bottle
2847018 i felt like i should treasure everything that i have because you never know
2847019 i want to make sure any program will reduce demand
2847020 is there a way to calculate savings and are they predictable
2847021 for how long will it lead to savings we call that persistence of savings how long will it take to reduce the peak demand and save energy
2847022 the easiest thing for the average customer to do is nothing
2847023 you get your energy delivered to you its all done with public funds and financed over thirty years and if you dont do another thing the lights will still come on
2847024 when im scratching my head trying to figure out whether to invest in an improvement the rebates help the contractors close the deal and youre making an individual contribution to help the public good
2847025 the incentive program as far as generating business and being able to sell energy efficiency upgrades is huge
2847026 they have a reputation for being very progressive but theyre probably more conservative than their reputation they have to make sure the spending is justified
2847027 the solar guys sold the city on relatively expensive rebates you have to be a bit careful about whose kool aid you drink but by and large rebates are important to increasing the adoption rate of efficient equipment
2847028 if comedy is the new rock and roll it certainly isnt perceived as a healthy profession
2847029 whether its true or not comedians are seen as people who stay up late travel around the country stopping to eat at service stations and we thought we should use comedy to promote more positive health messages
2847030 they are real health checks by real nurses to encourage people to think a bit more about their health
2847031 i think the main thing will be encouraging healthy eating and lifestyle changes but a lot of younger comedians are already taking that message on board
2847032 focusing on one possible distraction could very well create a false sense of security
2847033 it would be most effective to look at all the possible problems that can arise in situations that drivers could be confronted with and deal with them comprehensively
2847034 that i think is what pushed us over to decide that its not a question of hands free or hand held
2847035 its just a question of talking on a cell phone
2847036 to take into account the studies that conclude that it is a distraction and to ignore those that would conclude the contrary doesnt do the whole debate justice
2847037 to look at one potential behavior and highlight it and ignore dozens of others that are extremely common is not dealing with this situation as effectively as it could be
2847038 im not sure that any law can be too strict when youre talking about protecting the children in these school zones
2847039 the highlands and islands have strong military connections going back to jacobite times and since culloden right through to world war i up to the modern day
2847040 when people need to cut back they want to cut back on price first and quality last and if they have the opportunity to get bargains from the stores they like and also get the selection they want they will look to the outlet centers
2847041 i used to bring the kids out here for back to school shopping because the deals are pretty good and you can just sit down give the kids money and tell them to go get what they want
2847042 a brief history i first went to cafe la taza by myself during an eye doctor appointment across the street at dr
2847043 this is the easiest way to run a coffee shop
2847044 i seem to recall saving your life on more than one occasion mr
2847045 i mean that even though youre absolutely brilliant with centuries of accomplishments behind you and poised to stride out among the stars youre possibly the least logical species in the universe curiosity triumphs over caution and love over fear
2847046 i travelled across the world from the ruins of new york to the fusion mills of china right across the radiation pits of europe and everywhere i went i saw people just like you living as slaves but if martha jones became a legend then thats wrong because my name isnt important theres someone else the man who sent me out there the man who told me to walk the earth and his name is the doctor he has saved your lives so many times and you never even knew he was there he never stops he never stays he never asks to be thanked but ive seen him i know him i love him
2847047 dont worry old friend well get you fixed up in no time she just needs a bit of rest well let the smoke clear then we can get her back to her old self

2847113 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
2847114 i think they knew that history was being made tonight obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity

2847117 i dont need to drive if i live in the city
2847118 a cute little store packed with everything for your pets
2847119 it happens all the time ill take care of it
2847120 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2847121 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2847122 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2847123 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2847124 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2847125 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2847126 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2847127 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2847128 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2847129 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2847130 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2847131 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2847132 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2847133 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2847134 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2847135 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2847136 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2847137 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2847138 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2847139 it seems that half the times ive visited north beach ive eaten at the lobster shack
2847140 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2847141 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2847142 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2847143 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2847144 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2847145 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2847146 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2847147 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2847148 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2847149 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2847150 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2847151 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2847152 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2847153 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2847154 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2847155 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2847156 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2847157 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2847158 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2847159 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2847160 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2847161 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2847162 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2847163 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2847164 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2847165 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2847166 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2847167 who are open to doing something on the production side
2847168 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2847169 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2847170 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2847171 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2847172 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2847173 i go here every christmas eve with my parents what a cliche because this is some of the best chinese food in the city
2847174 okay if they are really talking this place up thre must be somethng good
2847175 i was so hungry i could have eaten anything and i really did eat anything
2847176 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2847177 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2847178 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2847179 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2847180 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2847181 i recently attended a sf symphony performance for the first time in years and was reminded of how much i love the symphony
2847182 just blinked for a long second amp opened my eyes to find ive somehow escaped the city for the afternoon
2847183 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2847184 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2847185 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2847186 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2847187 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2847188 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2847189 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2847190 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2847191 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2847192 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2847193 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2847194 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2847195 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2847196 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2847197 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2847198 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2847199 as much as bush keeps drumming up and wants to isolate china and divide her people the backlash will be stronger with the arrogance of the mainstream western and u s media of printing everything 95 percent of the people know the truth of how evil the western and u s governments are
2847200 it is contrary to what the olympic ideals stand for the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for
2847201 the support were getting so far from home is humbling
2847202 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2847203 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2847204 the problem in the past has been the expense of geothermal energy generation
2847205 the pipes affect the migration of wild animals and where we can graze our cattle
2847206 now they are drilling wells on either side of our valley it scares off the animals also the vegetation has changed
2847207 the huge benefits of course are that you are getting indigenous electricity which doesnt rely on expensive oil imports
2847208 the other benefit is that you dont get any co2 emissions
2847209 we have intensified exploration of geothermal resources because we want to find a way to bring the cost of power down and hopefully bring in investors by 2030 at least 80 percent of kenyans will have power
2847210 coal is the dirtiest and most inefficient fossil fuel there is
2847211 rbs is providing the financial means for companies to build unabated coal fired power stations and dig new coal mines all over the world yet still refuses to disclose full information on the fossil fuel projects it helps finance or to take any responsibility for the emissions that result
2847212 people are coming from all over the country to protest against the proposed new coal fired power station at kingsnorth if rbs and the other banks dont stop financing such climate trashing projects they risk a similar public backlash
2847213 most significant impact on climate change is the investment and lending decisions we make
2847214 banks have a duty to give the public a full disclosure about fossil fuel financing so that account holders can choose whether they want their money to be used to support new coal projects like kingsnorth power station
2847215 we fund a balanced portfolio of generation assets that covers a spectrum from being the biggest funder of renewable generation projects globally to also supporting the oil sector which supports 300 000 jobs in the uk and our generation sector on which the uk depends
2847216 the result will be a significant drop in brazils farm exports
2847217 if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
2847218 working together and with the best data we can manage this problem
2847219 the process should really lead to the beginnings of a fundamental restructuring of how cities consume energy
2847220 cities compete in the market for business investment talent all sorts of things and finding ways to profit by tackling climate change can make them attractive
2847221 if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
2847222 working together and with the best data we can manage this problem
2847223 the process should really lead to the beginnings of a fundamental restructuring of how cities consume energy
2847224 cities compete in the market for business investment talent all sorts of things and finding ways to profit by tackling climate change can make them attractive
2847225 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2847226 you have to get focused and give it a go
2847227 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2847228 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2847229 i turned to my caddie on 16 and said god this is a lot of fun just to watch
2847230 im so excited last year was really tough not winning
2847231 and having to kind of not deal with it all year but getting reminded of it so i feel this kind of erases that and now when people talk to me about the u s am instead of condolences it will be congratulations you played great so im just thrilled
2847232 it was such a long week of golf its kind of like a golf marathon and youre required to play well every single day im very proud of myself for how ive played and to be able to keep up not just physically but also mentally that kind of endurance and also kind of hold up under the pressure
2847233 my duke golf coach dan brooks said after yesterdays semifinal match that i showed great patience against erynne lee and that was going to be the key for today that i just needed to be patient
2847234 because i just need to have confidence in my game and not really try to push anything or try to make things happen but just keep playing solid keep making pars and rolling them in to give myself chances for birdies
2847235 well i mean im happy because i played good but obviously im sad because i lost
2847236 i gave my best and thats all i could do
2847237 she didnt play that great but she had ups and downs from everywhere
2847238 she played like that all day she made pars pars pars and when she hit the green she made birdie she played really good i dont think she played that great but she had a good score she gave everything
2847239 i definitely wasnt going to make this like the cornerstone of my entire amateur career and saying that i didnt deserve those awards or not
2847240 going into today i knew it wasnt going to be the end of the world if i didnt win it and that it wasnt going to erase everything that i had done it was just something very nice to have accomplished
2847241 if we get to a four degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
2847242 a huge thank you to bushmans boots amp all fancy that and the participants
2847243 we chained both lisa robertson and lisa pangas to the footpath and they got a lot of people walking down the street
2847244 it was a really good day and a lot of fun next year we hope a lot more people will get involved
2847245 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now
2847246 this project will be owned by the people it is open to 12 to 18 year olds and they will be involved in all aspects of production from writing to performing costumes design makeup props and marketing
2847247 we are really excited about it and hope the kids will embrace it
2847248 we will be doing it every friday night for the next couple of months
2847249 to avoid any problems with the nomination my advice to candidates is to lodge as early as possible a candidate must be properly enrolled in the council they wish to represent and must be nominated by at least two people who are correctly enrolled in the same council area
2847250 screening mammography is the best method available for detecting breast cancer early and is the only tool we have for early detection that has been shown to reduce population mortality from breast cancer
2847251 women know their bodies and should check themselves if something deviates from the norm then they need to get checked out
2847252 the deep deep racial divisions within the party of jim crow
2847253 so racist that they dont even realize that white americans have moved on and so whenever there is a campaign like this such as this they always use racism in order to intimidate white americans
2847254 i want to do something kinda crazy today you wanna go skydiving or something
2847255 well it is getting pretty late in the day so we might not be able to set that up
2847256 good point hmmm how about shark wrangling or challenging a panda to a fist fight
2847257 it might be kinda hard to find a shark with whom to wrestle and i am pretty sure that panda bears are asiatic creatures and may not be readily available for the purposes of fighting also that panda is liable to kick your ass
2847258 i want to do something impulsive today lets go buy a snake whats the deal with buying snakes where can we buy a snake
2847259 if you are going to buy something then hurry up otherwise get out
2847260 cages marked with a red dot indicate an aggressive amp toxic

2847284 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2847285 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2847286 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2847287 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2847288 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2847289 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2847290 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2847291 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2847292 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2847293 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2847294 ik had van tevoren al gezien dat er voor mijn startbox veel water lag en toen mijn achterwielen het zwart wit geblokte gedeelte op de baan raakten had ik zoveel wheelspin dat ik nauwelijks meer vooruit kwam
2847295 wie er achterop rijdt is fout dat is heel simpel in het japans kennen ze de uitdrukking kamikaze en ik kan geen ander woord vinden om deze actie te omschrijven ik had een geweldige start en lag al tweede toen koudai mn achterwiel aantikte en ik direct een passagier was ik gleed over de baan en knalde in de muur einde verhaal zo zonde dit ik heb wel een paar schoenen kapotgetrapt zo kwaad was ik
2847296 nou ja dan zal het wel ergens in het midden liggen maar feit is dat ik er erg van baal
2847297 ik besef het nog niet helemaal maar mijn eerste overwinning in de formule 3 en dan gelijk in zon belangrijke race is natuurlijk heel mooi dank aan het team dat me een perfecte auto gegeven heeft mooi is voor mij vooral dat ik hier in belgi heb kunnen winnen want voor mij is belgi mijn tweede vaderland hier op het circuit waar mijn ooms vele successen hebben gevierd is het natuurlijk helemaal bijzonder
2847298 ja dat kan ik niet ontkennen gisteren was ik de snelste vandaag was het jules in de beginfase van de race had ik nog wel het idee dat ik een kans zou hebben om het gat naar hem dicht te rijden maar dat bleek uiteindelijk niet zo te zijn ik heb de race in feite verloren bij de start wist van tevoren al dat het daar moeilijk zou worden omdat de baan voor mijn startbox zo nat was jammer maar het is niet anders
2847299 ik had een fantastische start waarbij ik gelijk al van de zevende naar de derde plaats opklom het gat naar nico en jules voor me kon ik niet meer dichtrijden maar met dit resultaat in mijn eerste seizoen in de formule 3 ben ik zonder meer tevreden
2847300 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now
2847301 shall not the judge of all the earth do what is right
2847302 no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and i will raise him up on the last day
2847303 for who knows a persons thoughts except the spirit of that person which is in him so also no one comprehends the thoughts of god except the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit who is from god that we might understand the things freely given us by god
2847304 the natural person does not accept the things of the spirit of god for they are folly to him and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned
2847305 unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
2847306 to select by vote for an office position or membership
2847307 but sihon the king of heshbon would not let us pass by him for the lord your god hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that he might give him into your hand as he is this day
2847308 for it was the lords doing to harden their hearts that they should come against israel in battle in order that they should be devoted to destruction and should receive no mercy but be destroyed just as the lord commanded moses
2847309 and god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the leaders of shechem and the leaders of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech
2847310 thus says the lord behold i will raise up evil against you out of your own house
2847311 again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he incited david against them saying go number israel and judah
2847312 with him are strength and sound wisdom the deceived and the deceiver are his
2847313 the plans of the heart belong to man but the answer of the tongue is from the lord
2847314 but no human being can tame the tongue it is a restless evil full of deadly poison
2847315 the kings heart is a stream of water in the hand of the lord he turns it wherever he will
2847316 i form light and create darkness i make well being and create evil i am the lord who does all these things
2847317 o lord why do you make us wander from your ways and harden our heart so that we fear you not return for the sake of your servants the tribes of your heritage
2847318 i know o lord that the way of man is not in himself that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps
2847319 and if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word i the lord have deceived that prophet and i will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel
2847320 who has spoken and it came to pass unless the lord has commanded it is it not from the mouth of the most high that good and bad come
2847321 is a trumpet blown in a city and the people are not afraid does disaster come to a city unless the lord has done it
2847322 he has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart lest they see with their eyes and understand with their heart and turn and i would heal them
2847323 this jesus delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of god you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men
2847324 but what god foretold by the mouth of all the prophets that his christ would suffer he thus fulfilled
2847325 for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant jesus whom you anointed both herod and pontius pilate along with the gentiles and the peoples of israel to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place
2847326 so then he has mercy on whomever he wills and he hardens whomever he wills
2847327 in him we have obtained an inheritance having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will
2847328 for it is god who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure
2847329 therefore god sends them a strong delusion so that they may believe what is false

2847478 the technology is there now to allow people to be connected and to be heard in ways that have never been done before
2847479 what were trying to do is use the power of technology to basically leverage peoples personal political power and make it that much stronger were not doing it from a party perspective were doing it from a people perspective
2847480 we had been thinking of this as a way to connect people to their politics in a normal way
2847481 everybodys got a video camera now we just figured be your own campaign strategist if youre sitting back on the couch what would you want to see on television

2847489 the first notice that the mbta provided that they were going to the court was after they had gone to the court
2847490 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code programs or similar type of information to a computer and does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans
2847491 reflects the courts view that they believe that the massachusetts bay transit authority was likely to succeed on the merits we think thats actually not the case
2847492 courts have found that the first amendment covers these things
2847493 we believe that this is a protected speech activity when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that is something that should be protected
2847494 vem ska man ringa f r att ha lite party och skoj en s ndag natt

2847502 the crew and everybody involved with the team had a part in this one
2847503 he tagged me pretty good and it was enough to make me lift off the throttle a little
2847504 i was a little tight there at the end but its every man for himself at that point i guess
2847505 i was out of tires brakes and out of motor there at the end the car was flat worn out
2847506 my hat goes off to both micks and dilley they both ran a great race it was a good points day for us though

2847525 you know thats what youve got to do to win a championship
2847526 the important thing for our team right now is just the fact of getting back in the top five consistently each week
2847527 momentum is such a big key here in this series to be able to start off the chase on the right foot with a lot of momentum is huge
2847528 we know what we have to work on and were ready to go to work to get back to our best and get into the chase
2847529 youve just got to keep going and those statements will be made but you cant concentrate on that youve got to concentrate on your effort
2847530 youve got to go out there with the confidence every week that you can outdo all those guys but it doesnt really set forth to me that im necessarily the leader of joe gibbs racing
2847531 you cant compare how this slowdown might affect the movie industry to previous recessions
2847532 the industry still has a degree of recession resistance but this time around there is all this new technology and all these new distractions for moviegoers you didnt have web episodes and cable television and computer games coming out of your ears in the past

2847551 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
2847552 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
2847553 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam

2847577 its the start of something that can be great weve been waiting for years for this moment
2847578 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honor to play in it
2847579 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
2847580 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey

2847603 nearly 50 million more than the peak day in athens
2847604 on saturday dwarfing the 115 000 video streams for the first day of competition at the 04 games
2847605 nearly 50 million more than the peak day in athens
2847606 on saturday dwarfing the 115 000 video streams for the first day of competition at the 04 games
2847607 i think diaby will be out for about a month so we will have to work on some things which i saw on friday night when f bregas and denilson played together against ajax
2847608 it worked well with them you need a run of games to see if the partnership will work you cannot say after just one match but i am confident that it will
2847609 you cannot say cesc will be at his best on wednesday but he will be fit enough because looking at his reaction after the ajax game he does not look too bad
2847610 to win big trophies makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you at 21 he already has a lot of experience he is an intelligent boy but i would not like to put too much pressure on him
2847611 my target is always to spend the right money on the right player therefore the timing on your buy is also important i do not know yet if it will be the swiss or somebody else
2847612 i cant tell you anything at the moment i dont think he was here thats for sure i like his haircut its like mine and terry macs were in the 70s i cant say any more than that at the moment
2847613 alan smith is a newcastle player no doubt about that
2847614 i definitely think theres a lot more to come from alan he knows that
2847615 alans a player who wants to be successful hes got a lot of desire if he didnt have any desire id say youre wasting your time ive known lots of players turn themselves around i know alan will alan may not always be the best player on the pitch but no one tries harder
2847616 even then we may just decide its not the right thing to do
2847617 the wolves will be at the door already because of what happened last season
2847618 i fully understand that im not hiding from that if id have taken the job in the summer and put together the team weve got today people would be saying it will take time ive been in the championship for three years as a manager and won two promotions the other time we finished seventh so i think my record stands up to scrutiny but for every player and every manager youre only as good as your last game so as far as thats concerned were not very good
2847619 we may have played derby off the pitch at times
2847620 i have always said that i am very happy at chelsea
2847621 its a great team with great players and a great coach everythings going well here and i have two years left on my contract and i will spend them at chelsea
2847622 something is broken with chelsea nothing can stop me from leaving now
2847623 the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2847624 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2847625 we gave gary the right number of minutes today that was perfect for him
2847626 when you talk in terms of character and think that nevilles been out for that length of time and come back like that its remarkable hes a remarkable man the desire and determination and quality of his game of course i dont think gary will play all the time this season he wants to test himself playing a lot of games but if we get 30 or 35 games from him in his first season back well be delighted
2847627 it will be a challenge to win my place back absolutely
2847628 the competition for places throughout the team is fantastic as there are probably two or three players who can play in each position
2847629 my challenges this season are to stay fit and to make my way into the team again
2847630 it was fantastic just to get a competitive game under my belt and just to be out there and a part of it again was great i didnt feel anything injury wise today touch wood i just need more games now to get my sharpness back i just want to make a contribution this season when youre not playing you feel like youre not helping your team mates i hope this season i can contribute in some way
2847631 i think hell be glad just to be in our squad
2847632 i suppose he could be involved in a friendly there wouldnt be a problem with that though id prefer him to play with us for a few more weeks before getting back into international football
2847633 there is some light at the end of the tunnel were going to apply for manuchos work permit and were hopeful well get that danny welbeck is coming through and will be back in two or three weeks fraizer campbells showing the progress we expect of him and is a handful its not a bad thing relying on youth the team was playing well today dominating possession and having some good chances i know were having a problem scoring but well have players coming back and we will eventually add to the squad
2847634 rios an absolutely magnificent player whos approaching his best on that basis hes becoming the best central defender in the world by far it was an exemplary display at centre back intercepting every ball that came towards him and breaking out of central defence with comfort
2847635 but there were some other fine performances out there look at carlos tevez a year ago hed been to the copa america and he was not as fit as he is today hes light years ahead of that i expect big things from him this season hes got a lot of heart to play the game is never intimidated fights for every ball that comes near him hes a real handful
2847636 although hell deny that obviously im not going to comment on the penalty incident referees love being the centre of attention if we talk about them they are quite happy about that
2847637 eddie smith still thinks he got that decision last season right that is worrying there is absolutely no chance he will change his opinion on this one either
2847638 and i thought it was a penalty we only had four good players today and that isnt good enough
2847639 there are a lot of questions but we wont get any answers so there is no point asking
2847640 its a new partnership and the team needs to play in a manner that gets some success from them
2847641 theyre two players who are in the england squad and because of their physical attributes people will assume theyll work as a partnership but we need to get them the service so we can get the benefits of their ability that means more width
2847642 we played five in the middle for the majority of last season but are now looking to go 4 4 2 and clearly the players are struggling to adapt to that right now but we want to be a team you know youll get goals with
2847643 hes a player the manager set his sights on very early
2847644 hes only 22 and couldnt get a better opportunity to play with some of the players we have
2847645 we need time to gel well be ok there are 45 games left
2847646 guts and vision have kept the club going and to the players who have made it clear they want to roll up their sleeves and prove a point that we can surmount our astonishing penalties
2847647 the window closes on august 31 so anything can happen before then
2847648 players might come in and players might leave it is all possible
2847649 i would be absolutely delighted if berbatov was still at the club after the end of the transfer window and i really hope that is the case
2847650 he is a magnificent player and we want to enjoy another season of him at this club i cant say whether dimitar is happy or not
2847651 im happy with the work the team has done in general the results are not so important but we have prepared very well for the new season
2847652 theres a lot of competition to get a place in the team now so thats one of the biggest positives of all everyone has made a big effort
2847653 im very happy with my decision to stop eating meat
2847654 i guess my body has just detoxed all the crap out and now im just really happy and healthy i have so much more energy im not weighed down by flesh rotting in my stomach
2847655 im happy with myself and i know the truth i absolutely in no way shape or form have an eating disorder
2847656 i made a choice for a healthier lifestyle and its my personal choice thats the way it is
2847657 he was really intelligent fit and a really lovable guy with a great sense of humour she said
2847658 my little brother i love you so so much amp cant believe they have taken you from us how cruel you will always be with me such a wonderful special person so kind and caring and loved by so many
2847659 i saw him lying on the ground there were several people treating him and they had his shirt off and someone yelling to runners to keep moving it was quite unsettling she said
2847660 a great example of courageous and innovative leadership addressing problems and perceptions in a notorious public housing estate
2847661 ive been a security officer for years and this was the worst ive ever had we had people pulling knives on us throwing bricks at us houses were being burnt down in front of our eyes it was dangerous i would tell taxis and pizza delivery people not to go up here
2847662 i had to convince myself let alone my wife and three little ones that it would be ok
2847663 if your father is a baker its more than likely youre going to muck around with dough
2847664 spence street is uncle johns home unfortunately for him home is not a concept recognised by certain faceless executives of housing nsw
2847665 relocating all tenants to alternative public housing in an area of their choice
2847666 i hope they make a video game of me at least i wouldnt have any cellulite then
2847667 theres just too much music too much hype and no monetary investment by the labels to sustain the really good indie bands
2847668 it will be a big challenge and something i take on until i die
2847669 this isnt a job you can do for 20 years then retire this is a job for the next 60 years or more
2847670 we are sure that something so essentially australian will quickly seize the approval of the young as well
2847671 we dont want to get away from the larrikin side of him
2847672 thats how my grandfather saw himself and his mates growing up beside the railway tracks at hornsby
2847673 meggsie is the fair dinkum aussie when hes down and out he always finds something to grin about theres always a twinkle in his eye even when hes been beaten to a pulp by tiger kelly
2847674 im nearly 40 and my friends have young kids and most of them dont know who meggsie is so were trying to get him out there again
2847675 hes always around and god forbid the day hes not around
2847676 ive read the strip since i was a little kid
2847677 theres not a lot to do in karratha so i spent a lot of my time drawing i was born with a pen in my hand i suppose
2847678 i got through to the final round of auditions but then john clark the head of the school said look jason you can act but youre a cartoonist who wants to be a cartoon
2847679 i said fine bugger acting so i pursued a career as a cartoonist but i still had an urge to get in front of an audience because i was always the class clown i thought maybe stand up was a good way to go to my surprise i wasnt half bad at it
2847680 we found we had a lot in common and became really good mates
2847681 he schooled me in the industry not just the technical skills but how its not just about the art but the people involved
2847682 basically he taught me how to do it right how to avoid the pitfalls he had a lifetime of success in the cartooning industry as well as having been a television presenter and actor he was a very talented bloke
2847683 i suppose that as a result of us working so closely together we became very similar in terms of our work style and humour so towards the end of his life i must have seemed to him the obvious choice to take over the ginger meggs legacy
2847684 the faith kems showed in asking me to do it meant more to me than anything else and the fact that he asked me meant that he knew he was dying which to me was devastating
2847685 he could no longer talk but his wife helen put the phone up to his ear and i said you dont have to worry mate meggs is in safe hands hes going to go well beyond his 100th year
2847686 i saw him in the prince of wales hospital less than a month before he died and when i said goodbye i shook his hand and he sort of pulled my hand back held onto it and looked me straight in the eye
2847687 why because when youre writing in a studio effectively on your own its very easy to go stale with no one to bounce off you have no gauge of how funny you are
2847688 but when you get up in front of an audience and deliver something youve written and it gets a laugh that feedback is a really good measure of whether youve got a finger on the pulse of what works whats funny
2847689 the reason it has lasted so long is because it has adapted with the times ginger meggs always reflected societys changes society today is a bit more cynical people are more technologically aware and environmentally aware than they used to be
2847690 as a result meggs is going to reflect those things hes not going to be running a billycart down deadmans hill quite as much as he used to because that is a very 1920s thing to do and meggs is now living in a 21st century world
2847691 whether its online animated interactive on mobiles ipods or whatever meggs is going to evolve with the times
2847692 cannot open remote folder public html access denied the file may not exist or there could be a permission problem
2847693 everything is pretty well fine other than the fact he has stitches
2847694 so we are going to try to get that healed and then we will get him back out here
2847695 i think i am playing very good and my confidence is very very high
2847696 i hope to be good for the u s open because its the most important tournament of the rest off the year
2847697 if i want to be in the top 10 i have to beat them these players
2847698 i think the difference between getting to the top 10 and not is in your mind or your physical state
2847699 if i continue in this way i have a chance to be in the top 10 i dont know when if i am still beating roddick and top 10 players for sure i will be but you never know what may happen
2847700 maybe it will be this year next year or in two years but you have to work hard so i will try to improve my game and my serve because if you have a good serve it is very important

2847719 europe has barely begun to tap into its huge renewable energy potential our study looks beyond the timeframe of this years commission climate and energy package proposals and shows that it is feasible to meet all of europes electricity needs from renewable energy in the long term if the right strategies and measures are put in place creating a european renewables community in the mould of euratom would provide vital support to research pilot projects and the grid
2847720 europe had a coal and steel community for 50 years and its nuclear agency euratom has existed for over half a century it is high time for renewables to be given the same status with a treaty or system of enhanced cooperation between member states our study shows that the theoretical technical and economic potential is there to meet all electricity needs from renewable sources a european community on renewables could be in place by the first half of 2010 and funded from the sale of emissions permits
2847721 id like to call it my ultimate recycling project id like to see the house get another chance
2847722 and i dont think this house belongs in the dumpster its got a lot of years of good life left in it
2847723 it gives people the opportunity to get a home at a much lower cost than building
2847724 i suspect this is about 50 years old and its built a lot better than comparable houses are today
2847725 were very happy with the turnout and very happy to do it but you never know what to expect
2847726 this suggests there is a lot of spirit in richmond and the olympics are really engaging the community we now know weve got our job cut out for us to keep this growing
2847727 not everyone is going to win a gold medal but as in life we do our best and i think thats what the spirit of the olympics is forget whos taking steroids or not and celebrate the athletes there who have dedicated themselves and are proud to be representing their country
2847728 when i walked in there were 70 000 people and i was like i am now crying and laughing
2847729 and when i saw the canadian flag there was not another moment like it other than getting married thats the feeling every one of us today has were so proud and excited to think we will be hosting the next games
2847730 it was totally overwhelming lots of smog but an experience of a lifetime
2847731 it was much bigger than i expected even the crowds were overwhelming
2847732 there are so many memories it would be hard to pick out just one this turnout today indicates to me there is lots of support interest and enthusiasm for the olympics and richmond should be very proud
2847733 we won only that one game but we were very close and never lost by more than one goal
2847734 in fact against belgium i think we went to 35 or 40 minutes of overtime before they scored on a penalty corner but defeating argentina after coming seventh at the pan ams was a big big milestone
2847735 seeing so many people out for the beijing opening ceremonies i can only imagine what its going to be like for our olympics
2847736 there are so many memories it would be hard to pick out just one this turnout today indicates to me there is lots of support interest and enthusiasm for the olympics and richmond should be very proud
2847737 seeing so many people out for the beijing opening ceremonies i can only imagine what its going to be like for our olympics
2847738 my homer is not a communist he may be a liar a pig an idiot a communist but he is not a porn star
2847739 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house i just managed to get out of there in time
2847740 there was a very large of amount of fire when we arrived it could have been much more serious
2847741 i thought i was going to die it was unbelievable the house shifted the front door its a solid wooden door its in pieces
2847742 my homer is not a communist he may be a liar a pig an idiot a communist but he is not a porn star
2847743 why it is lovely here on pier 17 the smell of s is quite overwhelming

2847752 estoy muy satisfecho de lo que hemos hecho en un 90 creo que hemos salvado el partido con un sobresaliente por tratarse del debut y tambi n de grecia
2847753 pens en hacerlo pero tal como los vi entrenar sab a que estaban preparados
2847754 la ventaja que tenemos es que contamos con 12 jugadores que nos permiten mantener un ritmo muy alto sin que nadie lo resista eso es lo que hace la diferencia

2847775 no es com n ponerse a estudiar direcci n de orquesta a los 18
2847776 normalmente la tarea de un director asistente es hacer los ensayos que no hace el titular y si alguna vez le sucede algo a este y no puede hacer el concierto entra el asistente pero en la banda todos los conciertos de parques y jardines quedan bajo mi responsabilidad
2847777 me siento orgulloso y muy contento de poder participar en la champions juegue o no desde el primer d a el t cnico nos ha inculcado que el partido contra el wisla es una final
2847778 est realizando una pretemporada muy buena y demuestra todos los d as que est implicado
2847779 todos sabemos que es un gran jugador y nos beneficiamos de l si se queda estar contento y si no le desear lo mejor
2847780 yo veo una l nea defensiva fuerte segura y muy buena simplemente falta pulirla como todas las l neas pero para esto sirven las pretemporadas
2847781 a m me preocupa estar al m ximo nivel y hacerle dif cil la decisi n a guardiola lo m s importante es el grupo porque el equipo siempre est por encima de los jugadores
2847782 en unas confesiones po ticas y vibrantes con la ciudad de trasfondo jugando un papel decisivo
2847783 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2847784 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2847785 that a democratically elected president of georgia and i quote must go
2847786 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2847787 id like to say straightaway that regime change is an american expression
2847788 we do not use such an expression but sometimes there are occasions and we know from history that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle
2847789 without the departure of saakashvili it is impossible to stop the conflict in south ossetia
2847790 russias intention to erase georgian statehood to exterminate georgian people
2847791 something that we believed always that russia had in mind
2847792 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on nonuse of force
2847793 unfortunately when we arrived on the scene there was nothing we could do
2847794 sarah was one of lifes great enthusiasts she was so excited about this trip she was so full of life
2847795 we dont regret her going but obviously we regret that this accident happened just two weeks into her trip

2847814 ben noticed bends in the middle of two different seamount chains tracks of volcanoes on the ocean floor off of eastern australia
2847815 the chains were offset at the same time that the volcano migration slowed on land giving further evidence that the plateau arrived then and caused an abrupt westward plate excursion
2847816 we think the immense plateau which is roughly the size of greenland blocked australias northerly movement rapidly altering the pattern of volcanic activity between 26 and 23 ma
2847817 before the collision the pacific plate was sinking or subducting below the australian plate
2847818 however the arrival of the plateau jammed and reversed this system such that the australian plate now sinks below the pacific
2847819 rapid change in drift of the australian plate records collision with ontong java plateau

2847824 this report should be a wake up call to all governments to drop their mad fixation with using farmland to produce fuels for our cars the world desperately needs real solutions to our energy food and climate problems that dont threaten nature or people and their right to food
2847825 according to gallaghers evidence there should simply be no mandatory target although the report fails to make this concrete policy recommendation
2847826 blind faith in so called second generation biofuels that are years away and could even cause environmental damage should not justify setting strict eu targets today
2847827 current biofuels policies pose unacceptable risks including exacerbating the climate crisis and devastating wildlife habitats it is time for the eu to be brave enough to admit that this policy is heading in the wrong direction the 10 per cent target must be dropped
2847828 given the scale of the current global food crisis the eu should not be pursuing policies that take food away from people and put it into cars

2847833 paid work is the route to independence and well being for most people and is the best way to reduce child poverty
2847834 long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
2847835 instead we will be going one better and will focus on long term unemployed by requiring them to get paid work and get off the benefit
2847836 within 12 months of taking office national will require everyone who has been on the dole for more than a year to re apply for their benefit and undergo a comprehensive work assessment

2847873 we made a poor start last season so we wanted to get a first win under our belts as quickly as possible
2847874 i dont want to sell anyone thats the message i want to send out
2847875 there has been a certain amount of hovering but i would hope that teams respect our situation i dont think any manager wants a last minute rush
2847876 i think perhaps the build up and the anxiety over the five weeks for both sets of teams didnt deliver the performance we would like to have seen
2847877 but as the away team we have to be reasonably content
2847878 i dont think we have got anything to be frightened of this season i stressed that to the players
2847879 we have got to prove our worth it was a tough test but we are a championship team now we have got to compete and thats the reality we showed a level of commitment to stop and block reading and its nice not to get beat

2847888 this is a small step in the right direction but a truly missed opportunity compared to what should have been achieved
2847889 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2847890 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
2847891 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
2847892 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving

2847899 i know people are referring to us as the chelsea of the championship which i dont believe as we are doing it in a more structured way but thats what were up against
2847900 i tell flavio what exactly is happening in training how the games go hes fine and perfectly supportive we speak two or three times a week well have a conversation about how he thinks the game is played he understands how to build teams
2847901 i think it went to my head and i was already thinking about my celebration
2847902 ive been practising all week and didnt miss one the new owners do come to the training quite a lot and we know them on first name terms theyre just like friends and they seem to know everything about football flavio asked me what i was doing taking the penalty afterwards he was just having a joke i think
2847903 disfrut mucho trabajando con whitney en like i never left es muy cool sencilla y educada aunque conservadora la qu mica fue instant nea
2847904 s tu chica vuelve y quiero que me ames como si nunca me hubiera ido

2847906 todos los que probaron este fruto dulce como la miel ya no quer an llevar noticias ni regresar solo quedarse con los lot fagos comiendo lotos sin acordarse del retorno al pa s
2847907 obviously i was trying to win but thats it its not disappointing
2847908 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2847909 hes such a talented player that its just a matter of time
2847910 theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back
2847911 tienen pr cticamente abandonado al cap de creus por nada se nota que es un espacio protegido
2847912 quer a cuidar de las vi as que ten a mi padre aqu pero me lo han prohibido primero tengo que sacar un t tulo especial
2847913 la gr 11 es un camino dif cil pero a veces llevan colegios enteros a andar por aqu
2847914 muchas otras calas son tan peque as que caben solo seis o siete personas
2847915 its always pretty fun to be able to walk the dodgers off the field
2847916 for these guys that are in contention theres nothing better than to do that they did it to us in 04
2847917 its a feeling of if we dont get something started were going to find ourselves in a long september just being so far behind that were not even playing for anything
2847918 we had an opportunity to make something happen with someone in front of us right in our own yard
2847919 were going to have to reach down and reach back its how you come back
2847920 all in all its been a good week for me
2847921 considering that i hit on sunday for about 15 minutes and wasnt sure if i would even be able to play let alone win its been good
2847922 i have got a few matches in hopefully i can build on this in washington next week and then go to the u s open with enough matches under my belt
2847923 serving through a few matches this week it feels good so thats very good for the next few weeks
2847924 if you look at the last 20 years in tennis the players are much more athletic now the difference is these guys are huge i remember when i was considered big
2847925 the difference between being top 15 and a top five player competing for grand slams is big so we will see how far he del potro gets
2847926 he has got a huge forehand and i think he is the best of those three players he is playing with a lot of confidence
2847927 this is something i will treasure as a memory for the rest of my life
2847928 i had five dunks in one game it was amazing
2847929 the last time i had five dunks in a game i was 17 thats because of the energy of this crowd you could feel the electricity it was amazing
2847930 its very special to beat argentina in our first game
2847931 it was definitely an important game for us we are just a small country
2847932 it was a really exciting finish for the fans because all the putts mattered down the stretch
2847933 i really think i played well but i left too many shots out there
2847934 it was really exciting down the stretch but i really wanted that eagle at the end
2847935 he said it was just a fluke deal and said he got it trapped under a guys foot or stepped funny and rolled over it

2847939 they the comments were in the speech that was posted but she never gave that speech
2847940 it just unfortunately crept through the system and went out as a speech she delivered but it wasnt
2847941 he allegedly sent the e mail to air chinas office in tokyo from his computer friday
2847942 the e mail threatened to blow up air china planes unless the company halted all its flights it also threatened to force its planes to crash onto olympics sites
2847943 the take home message here is its a big deal
2847944 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
2847945 spencer made that putt a bomb it was a huge putt for him
2847946 for me to make it on top of him it takes all the wind from his sails to make that at that time you cant ask for anything more
2847947 the issue of work rights and higher wages is shaping up as a significant one for our members and other working people and the national party is doing all it can to shut us out of public debate on their negative policies
2847948 the union will not be wasting any more time or resources on nationals legal challenges
2847949 john they were so nearly alike on that last dive
2847950 cast not your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you

2847952 on the back of this the bank became concerned as to exactly what was happening with investor sentiment in nz
2847953 the bank was very clear that whilst it was prepared to provide capital and additional funding for the business that this was not in any way intended to substitute or underwrite the debenture holders position
2847954 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders
2847955 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
2847956 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2847957 elevated dopamine in the prefrontal cortex could result in an inflexible attentional focus on aversive stimuli

2847964 she is dominant and she just continues to get better
2847965 within the last year she has made so much improvement she is doing the little things her defense she is a hard worker
2847966 she has done well i think time will tell she has worked very hard to prepare herself she understands the things she needs to do and a lot of that is maturity
2847967 were a lot of perfectionists on this team we have really high standards for ourselves and our teammates
2847968 coach ralph weekly said ive been to the olympics before monica and it gets kind of crazy
2847969 i know who the starter is but im not telling anybody
2847970 pitching wise the strategy is different the way the hitters hit is different you have to see how korea hits the ball or how new zealand plays
2847971 we wont know until she puts on a uniform and gets on the mound and performs
2847972 i talked to candace parker and kara lawson last night
2847973 i talked to jevon tarantino and leigh smith me and candace were talking about going back to knoxville i know im going back in the fall for football games
2847974 plan carefully and you will have plenty if you act too quickly you will never have enough
2847975 live by the teachings of the bible for three weeks
2847976 viewers will be deeply moved by the participants personal journeys i believe that a major nationwide evangelism initiative could be launched on the back of the series
2847977 the broadcast will doubtless be accompanied by the percussive sound of thousands of christians enthusiastically smashing their foreheads against the wall with delight at the way theyre represented
2847978 an awe inspiring cathedral thats almost 1 000 years old where they are asked to participate in a communion service
2847979 all this is just the start of their three hard weeks can they embrace christian ideals and learn to live in a different way or will their old lives prove just too strong to resist
2847980 i certainly find this conversation compelling and as a user have been finding myself using twitter more and more to be updated on news following news sites like techcrunch but i still find the most compelling news alerts on twitter come from messages that my trusted twitter friends push out my way before i have a chance to read it in my in box or on a news website that i have to visit

2847989 if i asked my dog to run up that hill right now she would do it
2847990 she would never give up she just loves to work
2847991 within a fortnight she had pretty much forgotten about it she didnt once fall over shes pretty resilient
2847992 theres been no other research for us to look at so we cant predict what we will see we are not really setting out to find out something in particular we are going out there to gather information
2847993 we will be able to extract some information from it and then be able to feed that back into whoever is involved in working dogs
2847994 the overall aim is to increase the dogs longevity and performance
2847995 i am yet to meet a farmer who runs a farming operation which involves sheep or beef without a dog they are covering huge amounts of distance every day they also get places that vehicles cant
2847996 at the end of the day if you buy a two year old dog for 5000 and get five years work out of it youre paying them a grand a year where will you get any other worker who will work for a grand a year
2847997 the meaning of a historical site is related to how it was important to people of that period who built it and when it was built restoration of an historical site should be based on these relations its not right to see only ruins without knowing their real meaning
2847998 he cosido pesos en el velo pero ni as me lo han tenido que sujetar con pinzas porque se me iba
2847999 i wont go to rangiora now people have only heard one side of the story they dont know what ive put into it i wont even go and do my grocery shopping
2848000 theres no point in sending him back there because they dont have the resources to deal with him
2848001 for the children that are getting stood down they are just getting pushed to the side if they dont fit into the box then no one else wants to know about it
2848002 they deserve an education but they cant get it when theyre forced to go to mainstream schools
2848003 i just feel like weve got to go i dont think weve got any time left here
2848004 the referendum has exposed sharp divisions in bolivia between those who support the presidents socialist agenda and those who worry hes concentrating too much power in his own hands
2848005 it does the government is very much allied with indigenous groups here there is certainly an element of race in a lot of this in this crisis among the two sides here because many opposition leaders though not all are of european extraction but some analysts also say that morales has been using the race card to sow divisions and paint his foes as racists in other words delegitmize their concerns
2848006 because many opposition leaders though not all are of european extraction

2848024 when mozilo looked at wamus offer closely he didnt like the idea that the giant thrifts stock looked a bit overvalued to him trading at about 20 times earnings
2848025 he saw little upside if he took wamus stock in exchange for countrywides undervalued shares which were trading at their book or liquidation value
2848026 over the prior three years wamu had bought several other s amp ls word had spread in the industry that washington mutual ceo kerry killinger in some cases had overpaid and was having a tough time merging all the different computer systems that the s amp l used to originate and service its loans
2848027 to make matters worse the books amazon sent were not the correct books

2848056 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2848057 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2848058 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2848059 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

2848067 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2848068 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2848069 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2848070 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2848071 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2848072 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2848073 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2848074 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2848075 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2848076 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2848077 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2848078 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2848079 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2848080 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2848081 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2848082 yes we are friends and i do like to pass the day with you in serious and inconsequential chatter dusting beside you reading the back half of the paper while you read the front i would miss you do miss you and think of you very often i dont want to lose this happy space where i have found someone who is smart and easy and doesnt bother to check her diary when we arrange to meet
2848083 that was the whole point of the study to show parameters that differ but which couldnt be altered by learning or cognitive processes
2848084 as to the genetic factors the current view is that they may play a role in male homosexuality but they seem to be insignificant for female homosexuality
2848085 genetic factors therefore appear less probable as the major common denominator for all group differences observed here

2848088 a new relation on a new basis the new base has been laid down with the understanding from delhi a new unity with delhi isalready in process a new relation means better relations understanding and cooperation we want to come closer to new delhi on thebasis of new relations i always said that there is a special relationship with india geographical and cultural and therefore we should havea special relationship with new delhi no one can ignore this historical geographical and cultural fact what i am saying is that we will notside up with one country against the other we will maintain equidistance in political sense and not in terms of cooperation and otherthings the culture history and geographical relationship that nepal has with india will remain intact it is a historic fact and we will have tostrengthen this relationship
2848089 our people have put forward thisconcern that they feel that the treaty of 1950 lacks in equality and that it is not beneficial for nepal we thus want to review all the pointsof the 1950 treaty and we want to revise it according to new necessity
2848090 not exactly right now there are otherprovisions that we want to discuss in detail
2848091 that also should be reviewed and shouldbe made according to the necessity of the 21st century
2848092 in the transitional phase right now with the processes going on it bhattarais view isnot correct
2848093 i want to have a general review on all the treaties but specifically i want to review the 1950 treaty wewant changes in the 1950 treaty others may be okay or may be revised but we want to generally review them we want to strengthenrelations by re negotiating

2848127 i know how hard this has been on alon and were just doing everything we can to support him
2848128 alon decided several years ago when he was probably half the size he is now and when i still as able to beat him up that he was going to be an olympian
2848129 we all thought he was crazy because his times were so much slower my father even bet him that if he made the olympic team he would shave his mustache

2848148 his hope of becoming americas first black president depends heavily on winning over conservative voters and it would be suicidal for him to be perceived as a tool of a hollywood leftie which is how they regard george
2848149 slept with too many women done too many drugs and been to too many parties
2848150 george is a master at crafting his own image and he is helping obama to hone his image both domestically and abroad
2848151 he has tried to keep the true extent of their involvement out of the press because he is frightened of alienating voters
2848152 i certainly find this conversation compelling and as a user have been finding myself using twitter more and more to be updated on news following news sites like techcrunch but i still find the most compelling news alerts on twitter come from messages that my trusted twitter friends push out my way before i have a chance to read it in my in box or on a news website that i have to visit

2848166 sou o que se chama de pessoa impulsiva como descrever acho que assim vem me uma id ia ou um sentimento e eu em vez de refletir sobre o que me veio ajo quase que imediatamente o resultado tem sido meio a meio s vezes acontece que agi sob uma intui o dessas que n o falham s vezes erro completamente o que prova que n o se tratava de intui o mas de simples infantilidade trata se de saber se devo prosseguir nos meus impulsos e at que ponto posso control los deverei continuar a acertar e a errar aceitando os resultados resignadamente ou devo lutar e tornar me uma pessoa mais adulta e tamb m tenho medo de tornar me adulta demais eu perderia um dos prazeres do que um jogo infantil do que tantas vezes uma alegria pura vou pensar no assunto e certamente o resultado ainda vir sob a forma de um impulso n o sou madura bastante ainda ou nunca serei

2848176 neck and neck race between 2007 and this year over the issue of ice loss
2848177 we thought arctic ice cover might recover after last years unprecedented melting and indeed the picture didnt look too bad last month
2848178 and it now looks as if it will be a very close call indeed whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for ice cover over the arctic
2848179 weve never seen any kind of opening like this in history
2848180 it is not only record setting its unprecedented it doesnt resemble anything that weve observed before
2848181 in the 19th century there was a vigorous debate between the advantages of dry and wet sanitation systems the urgh factor is the reason why wet systems won but dry sanitation was a perfectly workable solution
2848182 the overall number of the displaced was decreasing because of the people who return to join to volunteer militias of south ossetia
2848183 ive never heard such heavy shelling in my life for the first two days i was hiding in the basement with my family finally i tried to step outside as i was outside a shell hit the roof of the house i fell to the ground and tried to bury myself under a tree at that point another shell hit the ground not far to me i got my leg hurt by the fragments i was so scared i just started running away and left my family behind now no one can tell me what happened to my two sons my daughter and my two grandchildren no one knows where they are
2848184 at this time were focusing on the health and welfare of the guests involved in this tragic accident
2848185 we cant tell her it will scare her too much
2848186 activities in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
2848187 people dont know what it is so they equate it with hyper sexuality violence and drug culture
2848188 people on the right can always say this doesnt represent family values and they can make these negative associations with hip hop that then barack or any other candidate is put in a position to defend
2848189 i am troubled sometimes by the misogyny and materialism of a lot of rap lyrics but i think the genius of the art form has shifted the culture and helped to desegregate music
2848190 hip hop is a celebration of not only what is right but what is wrong in society
2848191 a lot of times artists like ludacris they push the envelope in terms of describing the contradictions of american society
2848192 all indications show the 2008 election will probably have the largest youth voter turnout the largest hip hop voter turnout in us history
2848193 i just want to thank all my guys we had a really good car all day we charged from 17th where we started early in the race for a long time we were one of the best cars on the track
2848194 that last set of tires we got a little bit too loose but had a lot of fun out there today just want to thank bono crew chief kevin manion back at the shop for building this new car
2848195 truex extends high profile week with top five finish at watkins glen
2848196 amazing what a difference a signed contract will make in a driver
2848197 they just kind of got into each other and neither one of them said it was anything more than just hard racing both guys
2848198 it was a shame that it had the outcome for so many cars that were right there behind them at the time thats all we were checking making sure it was hard racing that we dont mind but we dont like it when it takes out a lot of cars the way it did
2848199 i had a run and i went underneath him and he just didnt give me a whole lot of room
2848200 maybe i shouldnt have been in there but were racing hard to stay in the top 35 in owner points and try to get back into the top 35 its unfortunate and im sorry for the fans and all the cars that got wrecked there and then they had to wait through that red flag
2848201 him and i were racing hard and i got underneath him going in there and he pretty much came down like i wasnt there
2848202 i tried to back out of it not to get into him he went wide so i checked the momentum up and it almost seemed like he was trying to get back at me after watching it it looked like it was racing deal and it wasnt anything blatant it just turned into a big mess with all the other cars that got into it davids all right and everybody can walk away and im sorry to all the teams that have tore up race cars i was just racing hard and trying to get the car back in the top 35 and youre racing for your job every weekend
2848203 i just hated that it ruined our day and a bunch of other innocent peoples days
2848204 our ford was running pretty good we had a good solid consistent day going and got into it there a little with the 00 car of mcdowell too bad it ended our day early but well come back and get them next week
2848205 he said he didnt really realize i was there on the outside of him and just kind of came up and kind of put us in the wall
2848206 so its a disappointing ending to a decent day we had going but well get them next week
2848207 what are we going to do to get a good finish i was happy we had a good car we learned a lot at the saturday nationwide series race i lost a lot of foot brakes as the race got going and the car got real tight the splitter was on the ground a little bit too much but that sort of did foil our strategy more important i think is trying to get the car more durable
2848208 tony jr might be trying something in there but he wouldnt get too crazy his deal is just to give me a chance every week and he wouldnt take too many risks
2848209 earnhardt jr uncertain but not critical of teams planned pit strategy
2848210 were in the top 35 and thats been our big deal and i know once we get in were not going to fall back out
2848211 the car was good crew chief jimmy elledge like usual used awesome strategy
2848212 when we get to michigan ill be a lot happier when we dont have to qualify on time right now im just a little disappointed because i wanted that top 10 and i wanted to finish off strong but 11th i will take it
2848213 i really wanted to win but my main focus was to get a good result
2848214 weve had so many problems the last few races that we needed to get a good race and try to gain in the driver point standings
2848215 we lost probably about 15 seconds on that probably 20 total because there were guys coming in to pit earlier and we needed to pit
2848216 crew chief steve letarte was trying to tell me to pit and i had no idea we just had a loose connection and finally they black flagged me but even while i was out there i was trying to fix it and i lost even more time doing that and so we finally got in there and shoot we came out and we were like 30th you know the car was a struggle already and the last thing we needed was to lose that much track position
2848217 its about as frustrating as you can get as a team as a driver its not any one persons fault were all in it together we have some work to do you know we had this same issue at the beginning of the sonoma race but we got some cautions to work on it we didnt have the cautions to work on it early enough here and it bit us
2848218 i cant believe we are where we are in the points to be honest with you
2848219 if it werent for us having such an awesome team we wouldnt be where we are as a team we know weve got to get the cars running better too at indianapolis it was exciting and it was great to be running up front but it was one of those weird crazy races add comment
2848220 i was pretty happy with it and it was pretty uneventful from our side
2848221 we didnt have any big dramas during the race the red there at the end kind of killed us a little bit im really proud of the whole organization
2848222 its hard to be disappointed with that because the good thing is that were back on track and its not all about wins
2848223 theres a bigger prize at the end of the year than an individual race the last three weeks have been good for us and the last two weeks to finish in the top two theres a lot of guys that would love to have two weeks in a row where they could say they finished second
2848224 the kiss of the sun for pardon the song of the birds for mirth one is nearer gods heart in a garden than anywhere else on earth
2848225 im nothing but a rabbit but if youre hungry im here eat me
2848226 you may not be anything but a rabbit but everybody will always remember you
2848227 theres you in the moon for all the mankind and for all the time
2848228 a big problem for employers is that people are going over the tasman wages have got to be competitive because youre not just competing with the local market but offshore as well
2848229 its always nice to have more in the back pocket
2848230 it didnt acknowledge that we are part of a global market
2848231 every half tonne they get is a huge loss to the sustainability of the industry especially when their population is already under threat
2848232 we as the people of aotearoa need to protect our fishery its crucial that people are vigilant if anyone sees anything suspicious please pass the information on
2848233 we want to keep the fishery safe we need to rebuild the population and look after it
2848234 the operation reinforces the determination of the ministry of fisheries to target and apprehend anyone involved with the poaching and possible black marketing of our fisheries resources
2848235 fishery officers can operate at any time of the day and night and fishers should comply with laws at all times
2848236 this brings the number of loops in blenheim to 22
2848237 it was on the books to do update the pa system so we decided to do the loop at the same time they suggested it would also be a good idea to install one at the check in area so they dont have to lean forward and struggle with background noise
2848238 theyve referred us to head office so thats in hand
2848239 the solution is to find more and to use less
2848240 there is no one way to get on top of this problem
2848241 there would be a massive loss of influence and clout were you to trade me in for a freshman democrat

2848248 we were providing security for our fellow soldiers and keeping the enemies heads down making sure coalition forces made it out alive
2848249 it feels good to know that youre helping the people that are forward of our position and doing everything we can to help our fellow soldiers
2848250 well for anybody thats coming to afghanistan make sure you bring a hobby with you because the mountains start closing in on you after a while
2848251 it gets pretty small so you have to keep yourself occupied just keep an open mind and just trust everybody thats around you
2848252 theyre always looking for ways to help out each other the team and the mission theyre just a good group of guys very willing to work always wanting to learn new things its only going to get better with this group of guys its going to be a cake walk friendships are going to build stronger and were going to work better as a team and get the mission done
2848253 to be able to be in public and be recognized not just for being a soldier but for being a soldier who happens to be gay is amazing
2848254 the creepiest part of his creepy confession was when he stressed to woodruff that he cheated on elizabeth in 2006 when her cancer was in remission his infidelity was oncologically correct

2848262 kelowna reported a total rainfall of 8 5 millimeters there was some intense lightning we were recording a lightning strike across the okanagan every three to five seconds

2848264 on our arrival we found fire in the basement area of the building there was heat damage to the basement area which was used for book storage and an office area and smoke damage to the rest of the building there was no structural damage and only contents were affected
2848265 there was no one occupying the building it was used as a church office building
2848266 it meant so much to our family that our fellow kelowna residents came out to support connor and canadian blood services
2848267 my son would not be where he is today if not for the blood donated by generous canadians and for that we are truly grateful
2848268 the support we received from the community throughout this blood drive was fantastic

2848270 there is legislation that mandates that boaters have certain equipment on board to navigate in the dark that will have to be looked into to determine if there was any fault
2848271 there are a lot of banks with that kind of yield
2848272 a place where the windows arent welded shut and i can actually feel the breeze everyday
2848273 i figure out how to deliver and if i leave flattened bodies in my wake then its too bad they got in the way
2848274 the yet to be named vice presidential pick will speak on the third
2848275 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2848276 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2848277 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2848278 every quarterback in the league feels like the offense is on their shoulders
2848279 youre the triggerman youre making the decisions out there theres pressure
2848280 he did a good job keeping us together out there after a couple of those penalties where sometimes you can shut down
2848281 he just has a presence in the huddle and when hes out there he keeps moving that ball we feed off him
2848282 youre playing a bland offense against a vanilla defense you cant put much stock into that
2848283 two young guys on the tackle so i mean were going to have to grow with them and theyre going to have to learn game by game and make mistakes that rookies make
2848284 need a little more continuity here and i thought we got it i will have to take a look at the film for sure
2848285 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
2848286 why is it that the people who are against abortion are the people you wouldnt want to fuck in the first place
2848287 behind the scenes many parts of the credit mortgage market were offered only
2848288 this countrys economy cant survive without structured finance some of it will go away but too much of the nations business is tied up in it

2848290 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
2848291 that mad mikes drying out at the clinic in minnesota the young and beautiful tyler is working as a bike messenger
2848292 i dont know who you thinks going to by this thing
2848293 im always thinking i like growing business thats exciting i like developing energy but how does it affect the last and the least what can we do to make it better for those people who probably never will get to the front of the line how can we make their lives better how can we pull them along how can we make them the most they can be how can we make them build their self esteem and self respect what more can we do
2848294 democrats will win elections when they figure out how to talk to those families
2848295 every time ive compromised ive lost when i held firm i won the problem with too many environmentalists today is that they are trying to write the compromise instead of letting those we pay to compromise do it they think they get power by taking people to lunch or being taken to lunch when in reality they are only being taken

2848298 nabi yang taat kepada tuhan dan berkenan di hati nya
2848299 yakub adalah nabi yang diberkati tuhan berada dalam kerajaan sorga kerajaan allah bersama dengan abraham ishak dan semua nabi allah
2848300 janganlah kamu menyangka bahwa aku datang untuk meniadakan hukum taurat atau kitab para nabi aku datang bukan untuk meniadakannya melainkan untuk menggenapinya
2848301 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
2848302 but the notion that somehow mccain is going to get in there and be some kind of ideological newt gingrich right winger is a joke theres no way that he would do that
2848303 they both have the intellectual ability and the maturity to form judgments about important policy issues id feel comfortable with both of them in there as president
2848304 they are not people who are just preening for the cameras theyre both celebrities but theyre the rare breed celebrities who are actually interested in getting things done
2848305 he definitely has the ability to work with people of the other party but he also i felt showed a willingness not to give away the store which would have been my principal concern
2848306 i thought this is going to be a guy im going to enjoy working with over the years because he knows when to hold em and when to fold em
2848307 hes a very good legislator from my point of view because when he gets onto something he doesnt just want to introduce a bill he likes to move it and hes fearless
2848308 people couldnt believe how long we stayed on mccain feingold wed come to those press conferences year after year and you guys would laugh at us i mean literally
2848309 hes a great guy to fight an uphill battle with legislatively he keeps his word i probably shouldnt be saying this stuff but to be honest about it it was one of the better professional experiences ive ever had in my life
2848310 unrecognizable from the john mccain of just a couple years ago
2848311 changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign
2848312 he does seem much more tight and less fun than he was in the 2000 campaign i worry for his sake though im supporting his opponent that his handlers are constraining him too much
2848313 its unfair because mccains a blast hes fun to be around hes certainly young in spirit hes actually very young in energy
2848314 yes he shows temper but he burns fast and he doesnt let it cloud his judgment he would not be a loose cannon in the oval office
2848315 its not like hes going to pick up the red phone in a rage
2848316 he is not a guy who wants to be chummy chummy with political leaders of the party he doesnt like that sort of constraint hes an independent
2848317 so he somehow managed to become the nominee of the republican party but we all know its not because he was somebody that was kissing up to the republican establishment to say the least
2848318 hes a real scrappy guy you look at him hes a smaller guy but he goes out and plays with a big heart
2848319 it doesnt surprise you when he comes out there and starts to do that
2848320 hes tough and he understands the game the quarterbacks trust him if he continues at the pace hes going hes going to play a lot for this team
2848321 he just felt a little tweak i guess but i dont know
2848322 he feels good right now but we wont know for sure for a couple of hours
2848323 we feel pretty good about where hes at hopefully with no setback
2848324 hes a real scrappy guy you look at him hes a smaller guy but he goes out and plays with a big heart
2848325 it doesnt surprise you when he comes out there and starts to do that
2848326 hes tough and he understands the game the quarterbacks trust him if he continues at the pace hes going hes going to play a lot for this team
2848327 he just felt a little tweak i guess but i dont know
2848328 he feels good right now but we wont know for sure for a couple of hours
2848329 we feel pretty good about where hes at hopefully with no setback
2848330 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2848331 you have to get focused and give it a go
2848332 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2848333 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2848334 stunt guys know how to take a punch and give a punch that would take a lot of the comedy away from what he was trying to do
2848335 he wanted a long choreographed fight sequence with guys who have no idea how to fight who lack the ability to knock each other out so it goes on and on and on
2848336 hes a fashionable man and he knows how to dodge a bullet
2848337 there are a lot of sweet charming actors out there
2848338 i just find some of the roles of guys that arent the kind of guys youre typically rooting for more interesting and more challenging if you can find a way for the audience to connect with a total expletive then you know youve done your work
2848339 i got a letter from sag a few months ago and it said something like hey you beat out the other mcbride you have more credits than him so you get the name
2848340 i was happy about it but i also felt like it was so expletive imagine youre that guy and someone has stolen your name thats not cool
2848341 hes playing well no doubt hes got a lot of talent his forehand is huge it will be interesting to see how he does
2848342 he certainly has the weapons it depends on how he builds on it
2848343 if i want to be in the top 10 i have to beat them highly ranked players on every surface and im beginning to do that
2848344 i hadnt been playing much and kind of made the final here out of nowhere
2848345 i was able to play this many days in a row and not have any health issues thats positive
2848346 you know how we do it were going to evaluate what we see based on performance
2848347 well we are holding stuff back for the regular season
2848348 well we are holding stuff back for the regular season
2848349 short covering in the dollar is hitting european currencies and currencies of commodity producing countries especially hard technical charts also signal the end of the euros rally
2848350 but the fall in the euro is not a result of aggressive dollar buying by investors
2848351 the currency and commodity moves look like a massive pain trade
2848352 all those short us dollar long commodities gains of the past six months are being squeezed away
2848353 markets are presently undergoing a major reconfiguration as investors continue to adjust to signs that the european economy has hit the wall squeezed by a combination of surging energy prices and tight monetary conditions overlaid with a credit crunch for good measure
2848354 predictions of a recovery in the dollar are now looking good
2848355 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
2848356 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
2848357 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2848358 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2848359 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2848360 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2848361 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2848362 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2848363 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2848364 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2848365 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2848366 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2848367 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2848368 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2848369 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2848370 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2848371 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2848372 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2848373 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2848374 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2848375 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2848376 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2848377 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2848378 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2848379 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2848380 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2848381 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2848382 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2848383 my friends family and i are shocked and appalled with francis decision to mail unfounded misleading and hurtful statements to thousands of households in las vegas
2848384 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
2848385 i had a headache this morning i felt very bad i couldnt imagine how i would shoot feeling this bad
2848386 especially since its the first gold medal of the olympics i feel amazing
2848387 as for the final i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2848388 im more proud of her than if i was to do it myself
2848389 i did my part i mean half of my job is done
2848390 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
2848391 thats the way i play thats my thing my goal is to put on a show and do it enough times i can make this team
2848392 people are going to love to watch him run i mean i love to watch him run
2848393 i know thats it i know thats why i didnt get drafted
2848394 i know thats why some people say i cant play people didnt see what i did they just saw my size but once coaches get to know me im as tough they come thats how i feel
2848395 ive always been the smaller guy ive always been one of the smallest people out on the field playing one of the toughest positions im always going to be but im still playing and im going to keep playing
2848396 thats it show them you can perform youll carry the ball they dont care where you came from
2848397 we liked him coming out we think he was a guy who carried the ball a lot ran tough and had that big time speed
2848398 and he was a receiver so you know he can catch the ball
2848399 he doesnt care he just sticks his face up in there sometimes he gets hit pretty hard and gets knocked back but he gets up and just goes again
2848400 turner likes you to get the ball back to the line of scrimmage as fast as you can and look for the lane to run in
2848401 he tells us all the time theres only been one barry sanders in the league and hes retired he wants us to be us he doesnt want to be a player killer but we also cant be coach killers weve got to listen to him and on certain plays we have to be patient we cant outrun the blockers i always outrun the offensive line because i just want to get there right now use my speed speed kills but speed can also kill you if you run out there without any blocking
2848402 hopefully they get a show and i get a few carries
2848403 because they know i dont need to have the pads off to run fast i can run fast with the pads on as fast as when i got them off they say youre just a track guy but im a football player thats why i play this game i love football i dont try to shy away from contact
2848404 most likely to increase blood pressure 10 points at the drop of a hat
2848405 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
2848406 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2848407 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2848408 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2848409 government projects or any other voluntary dealings entered into by the government and private individuals corporate entities or institutions
2848410 you have to create national consciousness among the majority of the people
2848411 legalmente ainda sou o governador de cochabamba vamos lutar esta batalha legal com toda for a e energia
2848412 digo a evo morales que n o deve comemorar porque o pa s acaba de ser quebrado em cinco departamentos estados que falam n o ao presidente
2848413 voc morales viola a constitui o que n s juramos cumprir
2848414 permane o como governador de cochabamba e seria um tremendo retrocesso voltarmos a ter um l der nomeado e n o eleito
2848415 voc morales foi eleito para trabalhar pela bol via e n o para dividir o pa s
2848416 foi visto um sentimento do povo boliviano rumo democracia e um sentimento de aprofundar este processo de mudan a a partir deste momento o voto do povo boliviano n o somente para escolher mas tamb m para revogar as autoridades
2848417 uma enorme bola de fogo que tomou conta do c u
2848418 foi uma tremenda explos o sentimos por toda parte ent o conseguimos sair a tempo
2848419 in our view its the richness of diversity like a colorful tapestry that makes the world and our neighborhood such a wonderful place
2848420 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
2848421 really all he wanted to do was put us through that hectic travel schedule just like were going to have when we go to china
2848422 he wanted to kind of tire us out and say you know this is how its going to be are you prepared for it
2848423 he does a great job of that he definitely has some tricks up his sleeve
2848424 in some ways we try to put them in situations we feel will either cause them to panic or cause them to take control of themselves
2848425 no matter how much you plan theres always little things that can happen and whether we have control over it or not we still have to perform
2848426 its very difficult sometimes to play this game and keep your confidence up
2848427 but being overconfident can cause you to be complacent i look at being overconfident as being a real lack of preparation a lack of focus and a lack of respect for the game and for other teams
2848428 i know this team well enough that were not going to go down that road we dont think that just because weve got the usa on our chests that were going to win
2848429 the day that we kind of let our guard down and starting reading our newspaper clippings and believing that were that dominant or that good is when youre going to get bit
2848430 theres numerous teams that could get hot during that week and win i guess thats my job to make sure that theyre not becoming overconfident but on the other hand to make sure that were confident as we can be when we walk into the arena
2848431 he can definitely work with our minds and make us mentally tough
2848432 the things that he talks about are making sure youre not just physically ready for a game but that youre mentally and emotionally ready
2848433 nach unserer r ckkehr aus tiflis und moskau wird es ein treffen der 27 eu staaten geben und dann hoffe ich auch wir werden sehen dass es ein sondertreffen der staats und regierungschefs gibt das g be dem politisch noch mehr gewicht dass die 27 eu staaten dar ber einigkeit erzielen direkt in der region zu intervenieren
2848434 wir sind verantwortlich f r unser umfeld die au enminister der 27 m ssen aber auch diskutieren was die krise im kaukasus f r das verh ltnis zu moskau bedeutet bei den neuen eu staaten aus mittel und osteuropa sind durch den russischen milit reinsatz alle vorurteile bekr ftigt worden dass moskau seinen einflussbereich mit allen mitteln ausdehnen wolle sie fordern einen deutlicheren ton gegen ber russland
2848435 this is just observational of course we really need more studies particularly on cognitive effects and women

2848445 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries across the oceans across the mountains across the prairies because we are made of sugar candy
2848446 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
2848447 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2848448 what features should i look for in a digital camera i want to take alot of outdoor natural setting pictures
2848449 georgias military plans reveal its ambition to reclaim the territories of abkhazia and south ossetia it lost in the wars of the early 1990s
2848450 according to the official goal of joining nato georgia needs to modernize its army train its soldiers and build facilities for them
2848451 but observers in tbilisi point that out patterns of spending suggest that georgia has other projects apart from its nato ambitions
2848452 the army also received significant training assistance as well as equipment from the united states military
2848453 georgia also received valuable equipment such as ten uh 1 transportation helicopters from the us government the value of the us military cooperation with the georgian armed forces in 2007 is estimated at 34 million as a result some 16 000 troops are now considered trained by the us military
2848454 the fact that the two new barracks are close to the conflict zones of abkhazia and south ossetia has led to concerns among both the de facto governments of those two regions and the international community that seeks a peaceful resolution to these conflicts
2848455 the russian military is continuing to empty its former soviet base in akhalkalaki transporting equipment and ammunition into its base in gumri in northern armenia akhalkalaki base is expected to be emptied by the end of the year while the russian base in batumi the next year
2848456 after this period the russian presence will be limited to the cis peacekeeping missions in south ossetia and abkhazia
2848457 moscow is increasingly displeased to see the nato and specifically us military presence becoming permanent in what once was part of its southern soviet provinces
2848458 the recent announcement in tbilisi to increase georgian military participation in iraq from 850 to 2 000 comes at a time when most european nations have already started withdrawing their troops and the bush administration is under political pressure in washington to come up with its own schedule to decrease troops

2848460 aids epidemic is not over in america especially not in black america
2848461 2006 cdc data tell us that about half of the just over 1 million americans living with hiv or aids are black
2848462 left behind black america a neglected priority in the global aids

2848475 the core i7 brand is the first of several new identifiers
2848476 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2848477 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2848478 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2848479 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2848480 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2848481 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2848482 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2848483 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2848484 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2848485 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2848486 sometimes local children attack us i dont know whether it is because we come from another country
2848487 this audit shows that the exceptional cases process is in chaos and patients are suffering
2848488 in the last 20 months 5 000 cancer patients have been forced to plead for their lives there has to be a better way
2848489 we urgently need some standardisation and transparency in the decision making process
2848490 we have heard from patients that one of their major concerns is the perceived postcode lottery in access to drugs that there are too many variations around who gets access to prescribed drugs and that these variations are a lottery depending on where you live
2848491 the draft nhs constitution will address this by making it explicit that patients have the right to nice approved drugs if clinically appropriate
2848492 thames customers have enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years but we now need to make essential investment to secure their services for the future this is particularly true for london where the water and sewerage infrastructure is ageing there will be an inevitable impact on bills but even so we will be able to keep them below the industry average
2848493 we were trying to cover all options and we were hoping that exactly that would happen
2848494 we did a lead out on the hill on thursday the training day
2848495 i led them out then emma picked up the tempo sharon laws was on her wheel so we had already rehearsed that finish we knew the point at 200 metres to go where we wanted nicole to go we knew at what point the legs would be getting heavy
2848496 we wanted to make sure she laid off coming into the final corner but perhaps not that far
2848497 we were afraid someone might come down in front of her so we told her to keep to the left we knew she would chew them up after that
2848498 the plan was emma would go three kilometres from the turnstiles on the last lap
2848499 as soon as she came into the road she was to attack as hard as she could to put the germans on the defensive it worked emmas attack was fully committed
2848500 nicole could watch and wait because the other riders know what emma can do on her own so they were thinking would she ride away or was she bluffing
2848501 we felt the germans were the most dangerous and they were put on the defensive one was using up all her energy chasing and trixi worrack their best rider was flapping
2848502 i thought yes we can stay away these girls want to catch guderzo so whatever happens well be going fast
2848503 it was like a working group trying to find out the best case scenarios for getting me to the olympics
2848504 its a team effort but its not just the riders the staff and back up as well
2848505 i had tried the other route racing all season but got to major championships without full energy in the tank so why do the same thing if it had been proven not to work
2848506 but it was a high risk strategy because i was trying it for the first time i stuck to the plan and i believed in it
2848507 hes had a trail of stunning women running around after him and has been the life and soul of every party hes been to in the last week
2848508 most of the time by the end of the night he can barely stand up
2848509 but hes just like anyone else having fun on holiday with a group of mates
2848510 maybe its based on me canceling my appointment with her the other day
2848511 the only reason george and i were going to see her today was to see how she was doing just to trying to reach out to her
2848512 it takes a lot out of us having those we had out church service this morning and that will get us through the day
2848513 todays visitation counts as one of those three visitation opportunities
2848514 olympic games are a dream come true for all the chinese
2848515 i cant make it to beijing so i choose to watch the equestrian events in hong kong instead to show my support for the games
2848516 its convenient for me to come to hong kong to show my support

2848518 the question who are we to judge other cultures is a bad question
2848519 postcolonial and multicultural contexts of our time do not require us to see the discourse and practice of human rights as ethnocentric
2848520 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2848521 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2848522 russia has launched a full scale military operation on air land and sea we have entered a totally new realm politically legally and diplomatically
2848523 there is almost no way we can imagine a return to the status quo
2848524 thwart its neighbors movement toward western society and western values
2848525 if the world is not able to stop russia here
2848526 he said russian officials however blamed outside meddling for stoking the conflict and said
2848527 do not be upset when the lord leads you pass pastures where you intended to stay do not be afraid when he leads you through the desert he knows exactly where he is leading you he is good and only wants that which is good for you sharon there will be valleys and difficulties
2848528 his name will be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace
2848529 but whatever was to my profit i now consider loss for the sake of christ what is more i consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing christ jesus my lord for whose sake i have lost all things but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining towards what is ahead i press on towards the goal to win the prize for which god has called me heavenward in christ jesus

2848531 these new figures are truly alarming and confirm that diabetes is one of the biggest health challenges facing the uk today there are currently 2 3 million people diagnosed with diabetes and more than half a million people are unaware they have the condition
2848532 good self management awareness and improved access to specialist diabetes care services are crucial if we are to curb this growing health crisis and see a reduction in the number of people dying from diabetes and complications attributed to the condition
2848533 with the economy slowing and energy bills on the rise it is totally unacceptable that hard pressed businesses are left so open to exploitation by energy suppliers
2848534 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them this audit shows that the exceptional cases process is in chaos and patients are suffering
2848535 we urge the government to accept our 10 point plan to end this bizarre and demeaning lottery
2848536 the traffic that comes to defcons public ip address takes a jog through new york
2848537 essentially we see every single piece of data coming down the wire before it gets here so that means we have a chance to edit it
2848538 you could not stop it until the hijacked route is removed from everybodys table
2848539 its very non obvious to novice users if youre an expert user you might see something
2848540 the other assumptions were that if you were to track the traffic you could tunnel it back there or coordinate with the endpoint somehow to soak up all the data they were expecting and transport it around the effects of your hijack
2848541 the ultimate goal is to kind of guilt trip the idiot providers
2848542 here at iowa state we have a remarkably diverse student body with literally dozens of non whites
2848543 we thought a picture with at least one non white happily interacting with whites would be a great way to show off this fact unfortunately we didnt have any pictures of whites and non whites actually interacting so we had to make one up
2848544 an unaltered or real cover photo would not have adequately captured the glorious rainbow of multiculturalism that is isu we thought it best to take a more illusory less actual approach in depicting this schools racial demographic
2848545 believe me this was not an easy task we combed through hundreds of school newspaper and yearbook file photos before we found a picture of a black guy
2848546 even then we had to keep searching because we felt it was important that the black guy be smiling
2848547 if you think its hard to find a picture of a black guy try finding a smiling black guy
2848548 each black guy you see in this catalog was in fact photographed at one point
2848549 this booklet is our way of letting people know the importance of including black guys in official school publications thats the iowa state promise
2848550 we have nothing against black guys at this school as evidenced by our dedication to adding them to images of campus life
2848551 that shows just how serious we are about our commitment to diversity
2848552 im sure mr jamison wherever he is would be thrilled to see his image used in the service of uplifting the black community and promoting friendship between the races
2848553 in fact i bet if he knew about this hed even thank us youre welcome marcus
2848554 the process of bringing our wants and our needs into realignment
2848555 were shedding jobs its much harder to borrow and what used to be capital gains are now capital losses
2848556 so glutted on everything that they had acquired and all the time that was robbed from them that they almost saw this downturn as a great opportunity to stop
2848557 you have to make a good film that would be a good film under any circumstances

2848561 the way we developed the performance capture workflow on avatar
2848562 that is going though facial algorithms and going back into the camera as a real time cg face of the character
2848563 you see it talk you see the eyes move it is pretty phenomenal
2848564 once weve laid down a take the take exists in the digital asset management system
2848565 its this amazing ability to quickly conjure scenes and images and great fantasyscapes that is very visual we call it director centric because i can use the camera to block the actors
2848566 when you are doing performance capture creatively its very daunting its very hard to imagine what it will look like but if you can see it if you can have a virtual image of what is it going to be like then you are there as the processing power goes up our models get more sophisticated and our lighting tools get more sophisticated even while we are making this movie im still doing a lot of virtual camera work on the film on stuff that was shot six months ago
2848567 we changed the words and he redid the dialogue we didnt have to recapture his body performance and he didnt have to put the performance capture suit on again we were just creating new words and we were creating a new face
2848568 one movie where the aesthetics of physical production and the aesthetics of virtual production are to the extent that we could do it pretty much it identical
2848569 were taking our virtual production toolset and superimposing it on physical production
2848570 we turned the set on the soundstage into a capture volume and turned the physical camera into a capture virtual camera so we were able to integrate cg characters and environments into our live action
2848571 we have people in flying vehicles and i can see what is outside the window fed in in real time
2848572 are we looking at a situation maybe 10 15 years out where most laptops are sold with 3 d stereoscopic screens most montors are stereo compatible most dvd players can run stereo content i can see this becoming much more pervasive that we are thinking now
2848573 i think back of our shots at titanic lensed for
2848574 when we look at 3 d display devices in the home which are already becoming available a lot of filmmakers and studios need to be making 3 d right now those production commitments are often based on the here and now instead of thinking about how much value there is to this 3 d product in the future why not master in 3 d now if there is only an incremental expense why not think about that now
2848575 you have to make a good film that would be a good film under any circumstances
2848576 you have to put the narrative first the reality is no matter how many 3 d screens we get you are still going to have a large number of people possibly the majority of people who see the film in a 2 d environment

2848591 our goal is to have vacation rental properties located along the entire coastline of oregon since the founding of oregon beach vacations in 2004 we have been approached by many homeowners along the southern oregon coast to manage their properties with the opening of our new florence office this august we will be able to give property owners and those interested in vacationing from florence to bandon and all areas in between the service they deserve and expect from our organization
2848592 we have kept a list of homeowners that have expressed interest in joining our rental program and we are just getting to the point where we can reconnect with these homeowners and offer our services to them within twelve months we are looking to have upwards of 40 properties on the south oregon coast from organic growth and we will be looking into acquisitions in this area

2848596 we recognise that short distance falls can cause this type of injury frankly they are rare but they do occur
2848597 claimed to have circumvented the security protocols of the electronic ticketing system the suit alleges the students publicly offered free subway rides for life to people over the internet and planned to show others how to duplicate their methods
2848598 prohibition of open discussion of security vulnerabilities greatly harms the ability of researchers to function and has a chilling effect not only on publication but on whether some important research is done in the first place greatly stifling scientific advancement

2848600 this requires a balancing of interests it should be considered that the publication of scientific studies carries a lot of weight in a democratic society as does informing society about serious issues in the chip because it allows for mitigating of the risks

2848650 theres no shortage of temptation out there in terms of the promotion of alcohol the availability of it etcetera but nevertheless it is disappointing
2848651 what i dont know is why people pirate my games
2848652 i might be able to get a general idea as to why people pirate stuff in general from reading warez forums and every other story on digg but im not interested in the general case i want to improve my business and ensure i stay afloat and to do that it would be mad to sit in the corner and ignore the opinions of that section of the public who pirate my games
2848653 i wont publicise who e mailed me or even store the addresses share them tell anyone them or make any use of them whatsoever ill just read them nothing else it will be entirely off the record and effectively anonymous i wont hand any email addresses to the riaa mpaa bsa or anyone at all under any circumstances ever
2848654 i occasionally post about piracy on my blog and i get a lot of comments from people who defend piracy or think i am too strongly against it or that i blow it out of proportion
2848655 the last few times i read these comments i got to thinking about the other side of the fence and wondering if there was something i just didnt get pirates never talk to the developers so i thought id see if there was something i could learn from it if i asked them for their honest views
2848656 i think its crazy for people to resent such a small price for a game i dont feel like the world has ended though we all routinely spend more than 10 or 15 on things that dont last as long as a decent pc game
2848657 a 15 t shirt can be a spur of the moment buy but a game for the same cost needs to be a work of genius i dont get why that is
2848658 most of them have been generic piracy points which is interesting although not the original request
2848659 i have got a few sarcastic ones but a lot of very long well thought out explanations mainly from people who dont pirate games now but used to in the past
2848660 pirates deliver a more convenient product at a better price
2848661 the ones that bug me are the people who are just trying to save money but could afford it or the ones with some intellectual justification for believing its their human rights to get free stuff
2848662 the thing is i personally prefer single player games so thats the style of game i design i do think a lot about the best way to set up my game demos the website and what after sales support content and patches to provide in order to reduce the extent of piracy for my games
2848663 i honestly think i might learn something ip owners characterize all pirates as freeloading scum
2848664 pirates characterize all ip owners as fat cat billionaires in gold plated ferraris its about time we both listened to each other more
2848665 dont be afraid to talk about piracy a lot of big name developers have blamed piracy for disappointing sales and there is a perception that the minute you mention it everyone will kick you in the face because its happened a lot recently
2848666 a well made blog about a fascinating subject very much useful information and lots of links to more in depth information and resources the only thing im not to happy about is all the ideas my girlfriend got from the site
2848667 you would definitely do great if you marketed this service i love your blog very niche oriented and a pleasant read keep up the good work
2848668 further out west towns like charleville got down to 1 4c so those cool temperatures are definitely continuing across the state
2848669 it has been quite a cold winter because weve had those fine and dry conditions as well as cloud free days and that aids cooler weather
2848670 vsu voluntary student unionism has had a devastating impact on campus life and culture but also on essential support services that student organisations provide to help students while theyre at uni
2848671 this is a dreadful and sorry tale and i agree with that
2848672 we committed before the election that we would not reintroduce compulsory student unionism
2848673 we said we would find a way of working with universities and student organisations to make sure that students could get services and that students could engage in proper advocacy
2848674 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2848675 this is an extraordinary swing and it underlines the disillusionment australians are seeing and feeling with the lack of leadership from the new federal labor government a government that promised so much
2848676 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2848677 and all weve got is one watch after another fuelwatch grocerywatch and who knows what the next watch exercise will be
2848678 he promised action and delivered nothing thats why australians are so disillusioned
2848679 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2848680 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2848681 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done
2848682 but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2848683 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them
2848684 i think the military conflict in georgia is the key factor in pushing up oil prices this morning so much has happened so quickly since we first heard of russias attack last week
2848685 i think there is also some degree of a technical rebound after oils sharp fall on friday
2848686 the best part of the day is when i race

2848693 as far as i know its been quite quiet lets put aside the question of whether we like having them around the city or not the law requires that we enable it what i think weve quite successfully done is minimise them in the residential areas
2848694 didnt go where christchurch went and try to drive them down to a very small area
2848695 and just the involvement of council in that brought that to an end

2848699 we were still fundraising the final 6000 for the original fare the thought of another two years fundraising is really too much
2848700 i said im the executive director of the agency i can vouch for them right now but no
2848701 we were desperate at that point so i put it all on my credit card i will never ever fly qantas again
2848702 i was livid they just didnt want us on the plane with the dogs it was pitiful
2848703 the passenger must carry and present a recognised service dog id card or documentation at the time of check in
2848704 in this case although qantas operated the flight the passengers travelled as customers of american airlines therefore american airlines has responsibility for booking ticketing and providing passengers with information

2848710 if he runs ill support him if he doesnt im running im letting everybody know that im ready to go
2848711 we didnt specify to waipa district council ew or central government how much we want from them we didnt specifically ask for 500 000 if we can get 500 000 that would be absolutely fantastic
2848712 were working with staff at ew just reworking the trusts business plan so it satisfies any concerns they have
2848713 some of the five year olds coming in are very low functioning
2848714 their parents have used p and they have low levels of language theyre talking like two year olds have a low ability to concentrate and very poor behaviour
2848715 i think its going to get worse as we have to manage these children from p families unless theres adequate support offered from the government in the form of social workers in every school or a counsellor
2848716 more principals are talking about five year olds coming in with behavioural problems and a lack of concentration and it is becoming more prevalent
2848717 some of the behaviour and violent tendencies are quite alarming
2848718 a large number of five year olds are lovely but there are more and more coming through who are not
2848719 what that does to the foetus is stimulate receptors and neurons not usually used until after they are born and that encourages nerve cells to commit suicide knocking off brain cells
2848720 people on p forget to eat and take physical care the deterioration of the mother will affect the baby if shes not sleeping or eating
2848721 after babies were born they were much harder babies to live with if you get that and the mother going on p its a pretty spectacularly bad combination shaken baby neglected baby
2848722 they may or may not remember to feed the baby
2848723 alcohol is still the biggest problem in society but p is getting in there its the awful disrupted upbringing that is the biggest factor

2848728 this is an isolated incident that had nothing to do with anything other than what can happen in any big city around the world if it had been some other random tourist we wouldnt even know anything about it maybe
2848729 so of course she got on the plane anyway and ill be happy to have them here you know youve just got to live your life you cant live in fear or anger about what happened
2848730 bad things happen in fort wayne ind where were from everyday but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas still go to wal mart thats how you kind of have to live your life
2848731 they have told us not to do anything like that
2848732 you know at the olympics it could be anything it could be because you guys want an interview it could be a problem with tickets or logistics or practices we didnt know not until we got our therapy done and whatnot and saw the usoc people show up and the head of usa volleyball we knew something was wrong
2848733 we had lots of questions being only a couple hours since the incident they didnt have a lot of answers thats where most of the frustration came in were trying to make decisions in the next six hours people are supposed to fly here should we tell them to come not come was it something related to usa athletes or usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know obviously it was
2848734 we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens

2848741 hackers have historically focused devious efforts on computers using windows operating systems because the microsoft software has a horrible security model a registry and hasnt really been updated in 15 years
2848742 the truth is that the mac os is just as vulnerable as microsoft windows

2848746 several security researchers have predicted that 2006 will be the year mac os x loses its image as a
2848747 anti virus software firm mcafee has identified mac os x as a growing target for malware attacks
2848748 there will be a significant rise in virus attacks on both the mac and open source platforms according to renowned security expert eugene kaspersky
2848749 after years of relative safety in obscurity the apple mac is becoming an increasingly tempting target for malicious computer hackers according to a new report published this week
2848750 hackers have historically focused devious efforts on computers using windows operating systems because the microsoft software has a horrible security model a registry and hasnt really been updated in 15 years
2848751 osx is more vulnerable than vista and everyone knows it

2848767 the breadth of performance sea kayaking is fairly astounding this video should be in your library
2848768 this video hits the mark quite neatly anyone watching this could not fail to pick up the most important points of long boat handling navigation skills and some basic rescues
2848769 if you could have only one video about sea kayaking this would be a very good choice
2848770 breadth depth and details make this video demand more than a one time survey a comprehensive sea kayaking instructional textbook
2848771 we bought one for rental but discovered people want to own it so now we sell lots of them
2848772 if you are serious about learning to sea kayak the video is well worth the price

2848827 depending on how the datacentre is built enterprises and end users may face performance issues security issues availability and reliability issues
2848828 the most likely application performance issues will reach enterprises in terms of response times and this is something they could face especially within datacentres everything else which includes the analysis going forward and the entire review process across the layers and the modules of the application follow from the response time equation
2848829 i have worked with time stamp solutions before where any particular application is time marked when it passes from one layer to the other or from one stage in the network to another this helped us in the it team identify specific problem areas and address them rapidly this is something we will look to replicate in the roads and transport authority rta
2848830 the hitch is that app developers do not have too much understanding of the infrastructure and vice verse the app vendor does specify the requirements and the fine tuning setting of the hardware on which the application will work best or perform optimally but this is often not communicated properly so apps get put on an infrastructure which is probably not optimal and the app vendors often do not really know the infrastructure that the end user will be hosting the app on
2848831 essentially at worst you can have an app that is developed by a team of architects in isolation which works fine in a test environment but when thrown over the wall to the production network is either slow or unavailable or inherently insecure this can mean re engineering in some cases which is very expensive very time consuming and ultimately affects user adoption and the bottom line
2848832 apm ultimately does depend on equipment and hardware since the applications are hosted and run on the network and server nodes there are a multitude of tools to manage infrastructure but the key is to manage these from the perspective of apps and have the ability to correlate and see how failure with an element impacts the app
2848833 at the end you want to have a performing app when you get a problem with the response time enterprises will need to start the appropriate analysis process this will involve going into the various layers and looking through them to identify glitches this is where an appropriate apm tool with relevant analysis elements can help
2848834 i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest i heard the bullets hitting the chassis
2848835 my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was turned to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire
2848836 i got out this morning a friend found me and brought me out on the back of his motorbike i was already waiting for death in my basement the city is in ruins there are bodies lying in the street
2848837 all i have left is the clothes im standing in and these two bags my house was wooden it was turned to splinters by the shells i climbed out of the ruins i dont know where i will go i dont know what to do
2848838 i saw our house in flames as we ran theres nothing left for us to go back to our lives are ruined
2848839 people have no water no electricity no gas and no food
2848840 my relatives told me georgian soldiers burnt to death a family of seven people in their apartment an 18 year old boy who climbed out into the street for a few moments was shot dead by a sniper
2848841 we sat for four days in a cellar without food and water
2848842 when we came out we saw the whole street had burnt down the city was gone only ruins were left it was a slaughter first they bombed and shelled us then the tanks came in and levelled the city to the ground
2848843 i dont know what i will do now my town no longer exists my brother is still there fighting
2848844 when the firing died down i ran out to the home of my relatives on a different street
2848845 i saw that the city hospital was completed destroyed and around it lay corpses and injured people a lot of them and the injured lay there dying for three days because no one could get to them
2848846 where were the russian troops for the first three days now they say on television that russia defended us they saved south ossetia but thats rubbish
2848847 russian tanks only came this morning when we had already pushed the georgian forces out of tskhinvali we did it ossetians ourselves at the cost of many lives and russia came only at the end to take up positions that we had already won and now im lying here and my friends go on dying there
2848848 ossetian patriots first let us cleanse our markets of georgian spies then forward to liberate the homeland
2848849 we are sending men who have done military service so teenage lads dont go to die
2848850 in tskhinvali you cant find one brick standing on top of another the city is still disputed there are georgian strong points on the hills surrounding it im going back to fight tonight ive got my own team of guys
2848851 my cousin came from dmenis village last night he got two bullets in the back were going to go there and slaughter the georgians like the fascist pigs they are if the russians let us well smash them all the way to tbilisi we are a warrior race we know how to fight
2848852 the georgians hit our positions with grad missiles they surrounded us but we managed to break out if im needed ill be heading back

2848870 but under the parameters we were given for the federal law we didnt have a choice

2848926 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it

2848933 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years

2849256 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd

2849260 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2849261 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2849262 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2849263 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them i think the lesson from this election as prime minister kevin rudd has said and its a lesson for all politicians is youve always got to be in touch with the electorate and cant take anything for granted
2849264 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2849265 i think weve played some good footy in the latter part of the season this was a shocker
2849266 the players are so disappointed they know the supporters are back home and youve got some that have traveled across hoping for their season to be alive
2849267 i think even by winning your last three you probably need other results going your way
2849268 it was quite a disappointing first half the way we played our intensity around the ball wasnt good
2849269 no matter who you play or where you play you have got to present yourself and play at your maximum and we didnt do that in the first half
2849270 he was putting his hand up saying i can go out and have a go im about 80 per cent

2849273 in terms of emotion involved i dont think ive played in too many more like that
2849274 there wasnt a great deal said before the games in terms of the events that took place but it did have a galvanizing effect on the playing group
2849275 the way he attacked the ball sometimes he didnt even get a possession he would just dive on the ball and create a ball up
2849276 that a democratically elected president of georgia and i quote must go
2849277 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2849278 id like to say straightaway that regime change is an american expression
2849279 we do not use such an expression but sometimes there are occasions and we know from history that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle
2849280 without the departure of saakashvili it is impossible to stop the conflict in south ossetia
2849281 russias intention to erase georgian statehood to exterminate georgian people
2849282 something that we believed always that russia had in mind
2849283 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on nonuse of force

2849289 ideally we should have got a 250 lead so we fell a bit short but the ball is doing a bit and if the bowlers hit their stride tomorrow we can win this

2849307 a church planting movement is a rapid multiplication of indigenous churches planting churches that sweeps through a people group or population segment
2849308 always outstrip the population growth rate as they race toward reaching the entire people group
2849309 multiply churches and believers like jesus multiplied the loaves and fishes
2849310 when the momentum of reproducing churches outstrips the ability of the planters to control it a movement is underway
2849311 without exaggeration we can say that church planting movements are the most effective means in the world today for drawing lost millions into saving disciple building relationships with jesus christ
2849312 missionaries in church planting movements would never admit to sacrificing orthodoxy for the sake of rapid reproduction
2849313 and the word of god continued to increase and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in jerusalem
2849314 they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogue of the jews
2849315 began rejoicing and glorying in the word of the lord and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed and the word of the lord was spreading throughout the whole region
2849316 to him and to all who were in his house acts 16 31 32
2849317 many of them believed with not a few greek women of high standing as well as men
2849318 all the residents of asia heard the word of the lord both jews and greeks
2849319 the word of the lord continued to increase and prevail mightily
2849320 of this you have heard before in the word of the truth the gospel 6 which has come to you as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing as it also does among you since the day you heard it and understood the grace of god in truth
2849321 for we know brothers loved by god that he has chosen you 5 because our gospel came to you not only in word but also in power and in the holy spirit and with full conviction you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake 6 and you became imitators of us and of the lord for you received the word in much affliction with the joy of the holy spirit 7 so that you became an example to all the believers in macedonia and in achaia 8 for not only has the word of the lord sounded forth from you in macedonia and achaia but your faith in god has gone forth everywhere so that we need not say anything
2849322 many of them believed with not a few greek women of high standing as well as men
2849323 be alert remembering that for three years i did not cease night or day to admonish everyone with tears
2849324 and he stayed a year and six months teaching the word of god among them

2849412 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2849413 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2849414 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2849415 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2849416 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man

2849557 and they actually waited hilary came running so that was great
2849558 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety still to identify this first candidate for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2849559 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic make up to treat anxiety disorders
2849560 we used the startle reflex because its a very old evolutionary indication of anxiety its not something you can manipulate or fake the startle response is stronger when they were watching a negative image and there was a significantly greater startle response from the met met women compared with the rest of the group
2849561 anxiety is a very complex phenomenon and many genes are responsible for it but this particular genetic variation although involved in a small part of the anxiety response is an essential part of it

2849571 its somewhere i go a few times a year for me its become the big battery that i plug into to sort of recharge myself
2849572 that feels like home theres nowhere more appropriate to make this next step for a really important milestone in my life
2849573 i think its a little bit late for me worrying about what every down to earth aussie thinks of my choices
2849574 i know people see my choices as kind of eccentric or whatever but ive always just kind of followed my heart
2849575 things are not what they seem and the perceptions cannot tell us what they are
2849576 it is the sum total of all aspects of nature combined in one integrated whole in its heart is the savage uncontrollable fury of all the inanimate universe and at the same time the immeasurable serenity that succeeds it it is creation
2849577 leave it as it is you cannot improve on it and man can only mar it

2849587 the cd they sent was accompanied by no credentials there was no promo sheet name dropping the famous djs who are playing their music no pretentious cv stating who plays what and who used to play with whoever no info no blurb and no gumph in other words they just sent me a plain cd which was refreshing because at the end of the day all that matters is whether its any good or not right

2849622 we cannot as a nation succeed in fighting poverty in all its forms and as well as create wealth through increased productivity if the quality of our people is very deplorable
2849623 which was directed at those who had erected the unauthorized structures and not the fishmongers
2849624 an astonishing 98 per cent of the sports certificates from patan ahmedabad mehsana gandhinagar sabarkantha and banaskanthawere found to be bogus in our initial survey but then the numbers swelled as we did further probe
2849625 we have also asked for details of students who got fake certificates
2849626 we must begin to love our nation and protect government property as our own to prolong their lifespan
2849627 let us go on to maturity how to please god

2849630 creativity is so delicate a flower that praise tends to make it bloom while discouragement often nips it in the bud any of us will put out more and better ideas if our efforts are appreciated
2849631 dont take advantage of me just because i am a magnanimous person you are the parsimonious one and you have the temerity to call me the one rubbish either way i am pretty complacent with being gadabout as you can see that i am through the media in the past few days because in the end this is all leading me to my dharma ha love tila

2849635 i lie down in the middle of the field all i know is i couldnt move
2849636 because of my religious faith we try to go there every year to pray to spend some time with my family together and let my kids learn something about their religion
2849637 they said today hes getting better but theyll need to monitor him a few more days until hes stable

2849639 i wish i could have been there for my mom at the time when she needed me most
2849640 i should have been there to help her i could have helped her somehow
2849641 we were taught to be humble down to earth and quiet

2849655 richard we took it upon ourselves to go downtown and find a basketball stadium thats roofed where we can hold the crusade lets hold the service today in that stadium and if god stops the rain then well come back to the sports complex

2849662 this wasnt in the cards its not great for confidence but well show guts
2849663 leukaemia is a type of cancer where an excessive number of malfunctioning white blood cells are produced we have established the structure of a receptor that controls the actions of a blood forming regulator called gm csf
2849664 gm csf has been of interest to researchers and clinicians for many years now because its controller or receptor found on the surface of blood cells is critical in regulating their many functions
2849665 because our discovery shows precisely what the receptor looks like and also how it works we can now begin to design new drugs to rein in the deadly abnormal blood cells at the moment many leukaemias are treated with chemotherapy that destroys the diseased blood cells and bone marrow as well as normal cells we hope that this discovery will lead to targeted therapies more specific to the malfunctioning cells seen in diseases such as leukaemia
2849666 to maximise the drug development opportunities of this discovery both institutes have recently signed an agreement with biopharmaceutical company csl limited under the agreement the institutes will work with csl to discover and develop new therapeutic antibodies
2849667 this is a major step forward abnormal gm csf signalling is pivotal to a variety of serious and difficult to treat diseases with this discovery rational design of targeted therapies can now be accelerated greatly
2849668 svis australian cancer research foundation rational drug discovery facility michael parker and his collaborators are world leaders in their field in the past ten years the unit has discovered the structure of more than 30 disease causing proteins forming the basis for ongoing research into potential therapies this latest discovery is very exciting
2849669 we are delighted with the resounding success of the collaboration between professor lopez and professor parker professor lopez and his team lead the way in understanding how growth factor receptors signal this is a wonderful recognition of the importance of the research and its implications for the development of new drugs
2849670 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2849671 we are mindful of global economic uncertainty and the challenging cost environment but barring any unforseen factors our current forecasts suggest another year of double digit earnings growth in 2009
2849672 we remain well placed to benefit from record spending in essential infrastructure in the asia pacific region ongoing growth in the australian resources sector and the global trend for outsourcing of non core services
2849673 we have approached these testing market conditions fully aware of the likely implications for our businesses from a higher cost and reduced availability of funding to a possible deterioration of credit quality across the sector
2849674 notwithstanding this our determined and disciplined approach to writing sustainable and profitable business has placed the group in the best possible position to manage these market challenges we remain predominantly funded by retail deposits our credit quality remains sound and our prospects for growth remain solid
2849675 the margin lending business has withstood the recent market volatility to remain in excellent shape with record margin call activity resulting in specific provisions of just 4 4 million or 0 12 per cent of the portfolio
2849676 this study categorizes 6959 reference desk transactions to determine how many of the queries require the attention of a librarian results indicate that 89 could likely be answered by non librarians from the results of this and other studies the author explores the cost effectiveness of staffing a traditional reference desk with librarians
2849677 results of the current question analysis study also confirm that many questions can be considered simple directional or machine related
2849678 dividing the amount by the 6959 transactions shows that the library spent an average of 7
2849679 this may bolster the argument that librarians can leave answering most questions to others and can now concentrate on working on tasks that better utilize their training and experience as well as learning new skills that benefit the library the users and the institution

2849682 inject unwanted content into the enterprise as well as to lock down the registry
2849683 we recommend that apple enhance this area long term to optionally eliminate itunes that is as a desktop application as a necessary component to access business applications and manage the device
2849684 if an enterprise is using any of these extensions then it must reconcile the downgrade of these policies if deploying the iphone
2849685 the mobile web represents one of the largest emerging market opportunities weve seen in a decade
2849686 a person who in the opinion of others has heroic qualities or has performed a heroic act and is regarded as a model or ideal
2849687 a potential conclusion war in the newspapers isnt necessarily good for war on movie screens and stages the conflict in iraq and afghanistan is so much with us these days that maybe audiences have no inclination to engage with stories from old battlefields
2849688 perhaps right now audiences dont need to or cant bear to revisit testimony from the past however artfully and honestly it is presented to experience the range of emotions that an encounter with the ugly realities of war elicits
2849689 several years into a confusing war with complicated foes and several years after the sept 11 attacks we may have finally reached a point where the old forms of war fiction are no longer capable of giving us the solace and understanding we look for from this kind of material stories of noble sacrifice amid the comparatively uncomplicated moral climate of the two world wars seem so remote that emotional indulgence in them seems too much like escapism a turning away from the truths that we need to keep our eyes sharply focused on
2849690 singled out the decision to award mckellen an honour from the queen as an example of the dangers of the increasing power of the gay lobby
2849691 in this new years honours list actor ian mckellen was honoured for his work on behalf of homosexuals a century ago oscar wilde was locked up and put in jail
2849692 from the pulpit homophobia is preached by some arrogant religious leaders who think their beliefs are superior to our inborn and some would say god given nature
2849693 the bishop of motherwell devine addressed his flock and told them how appalled he was that i had received an honour and that 100 years ago i would have been imprisoned like oscar wilde he feels that the roman catholic church is beleaguered in some way
2849694 we neglect the gay lobby at our peril he said
2849695 the bishop is in my view a profoundly ignorant and stupid man in his views
2849696 if he finds it offensive that gay people want to celebrate those gay people who died in the holocaust which was a large number of people then hes also profoundly unchristian
2849697 the church is shocked by how quickly attitudes have changed all churches have thrived on prejudice its a means of keeping people under their control and i think they are really shocked at how quickly the world has moved on especially as it isnt the world they would like it to be so they cite biblical incidents as being the word of god
2849698 i was certainly not saying that homosexuality is a crime which requires prison nothing of the kind
2849699 the focus was on the progress made by homosexuals rather than the suggestion that there should be any draconian laws it is all very well people in the gay lobby demanding rights but they are riding roughshod over the rights of others in the process
2849700 its just sticking up for 2 000 years of christian values
2849701 no previous convictions rather than exemplary good character if what i read about him and the use of drugs is true
2849702 were hoping that his probation officer will advise him to stay with us if hes linked with drugs on his weekend visit he will lose the right to come out early he will be released on december 30 if hes a good boy ive told him to keep his head down
2849703 you know i really hate that one fucking toe its crooked it must be due to genetic inferiority we could never mate

2849708 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes today is the consolidation of change
2849709 were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalization and the state takeover of companies
2849710 coming back to the table negotiations peace talks a political solution thats it easy to say very difficult to do
2849711 its ugly and excessive a slap in the face to roman citizens if it was up to me id demolish it completely but because we havent got the money this is not possible
2849712 every day in the gulf coast league youre liable to see something youve never seen before
2849713 all i hear from everybody is yes there is growing interest in religion and spirituality and an openness on college campuses
2849714 everybody who is talking about it says something seems to be going on
2849715 are really exploring they are really interested in trying things out in attending one anothers services
2849716 among the new clubs is one created last year to encourage students to hold wide ranging dialogues about spirituality and faith meeting over lunch on thursdays in the chapels basement the students talk about what happens when you die or the nature of catholic spirituality
2849717 the discussion was off and running with one student saying one needed only to believe in
2849718 what are these things i was raised in and do i want to keep them
2849719 holy shit whats going on here this is weird college students asking deep existential questions
2849720 i suspect a lot of that has to do with uncertainty over the war
2849721 one of a growing number of religious student groups at colgate
2849722 every day in the gulf coast league youre liable to see something youve never seen before

2849727 we found one variant to be associated with weight and lean mass in both ethnic groups this variant was also associated with height total fat mass and hdl cholesterol but only in european american women a different variant was associated with triglyceride levels and hdl cholesterol in african american women
2849728 insects store fat like mammals do as lipid droplets accumulated in the fat body the functional equivalent of both mammalian liver and white adipose tissue
2849729 drosophila share many components of fat biosynthesis degradation and regulation with humans including many of those implicated in diabetes and obesity
2849730 the 2008 convention will highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation
2849731 we are at a critical moment in our nations history the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need barack obama is a leader to move america in a new direction and bring us together to turn moments of great challenge into moments of great opportunity this years democratic convention is the story of people from across the country who believe it is time for change
2849732 just as the obama campaign uses the energy and passion of grassroots volunteers combined with state of the art technology to bring people into their positive campaign for change so will the 2008 convention use the voices of the people through technology and innovative programming to lay out barack obamas vision and policies for how to move america in a new direction
2849733 it promises to enable energy producers to boost oil flows from mature reservoirs where billions of barrels of crude lie stranded
2849734 i get rung up once a month or so by mad inventors they came here with various tubes theyd built in their garages we tried the idea out in one or two tanks it seemed to have a very good prospect of escaping two big problems that all wave power devices have to face
2849735 the anaconda can achieve similar resonance by making the speed of the bulge wave the natural speed of the bulge wave in the tube match the speed of the water waves outside
2849736 we could see the first full size device deployed off the uk coast in around five years time
2849737 they have to think very seriously how well this will cope with very large waves which occur now and then
2849738 not fully convinced by his formulae i tried another mathematical approach and discovered to my surprise that the bulge should grow rapidly along the tube running just in front of the wave
2849739 this cabinet decision is sending a very strong message that as a government and country we are committing ourselves to a low carbon economy
2849740 this statement signals clear recognition by government as a whole that the transformational change required in response to global warming is fully consistent with addressing immediate development needs and inequality within our society
2849741 we are saying to business and society at large that we have to move away from dirty coal as a dominant energy source the longer we wait the more expensive it will become
2849742 the aim is to limit global temperature increases to two degrees above pre industrial levels
2849743 the time is right for the countrys private sector to show leadership by partnering with government to develop a solutions driven national climate change mitigation and adaptation response the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of mitigating the effects of climate change
2849744 every day in the gulf coast league youre liable to see something youve never seen before
2849745 every time i saw that ad on tv the first thought was an election for the worst ad certainly this ad could be nominated for a prize in ugliness and might be the champion ha ha

2849752 pauls utterly enchanted with nancy and hes already rolling the idea of marriage around in his head
2849753 he said what would you say if i asked nancy to be the next mrs mccartney and she joked back at least shes financially independent the whole family thinks nancys great a vast improvement on pauls last love interest
2849754 theyve been with each other 24 7 a perfect way to see if theyre suitable for marriage pauls not about to rush into anything but hes happier than hes been for years theyve got so much in common he knows heather was a mistake although he loves their little one daughter bea more than anything and wont be put off by a bad divorce experience
2849755 nancy and bruce have been separated a long time but her relationship with paul has spurred them on to finally dissolve the marriage theyve moved on with their lives and bruce approves of paul its all amicable
2849756 amfar is a prestigious organization to get funding from if you do hiv research so its a big testament to the work were doing
2849757 we hope that it will help us reach latinos who are at risk for hiv and improve the outcomes for hiv positive latinos so they are not affected disproportionately
2849758 latinos generally do not go to the doctor to get tested to see if they are infected with hiv until they are very very sick
2849759 and once diagnosed they dont take their medicine as prescribed even when they have access to life extending medicines
2849760 there are a number of different things that are affecting the attitudes and opinions toward medicine of the latino community this study will give us a sense of all the variables that are affecting the trust or mistrust of medicine
2849761 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2849762 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2849763 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2849764 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2849765 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2849766 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2849767 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2849768 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2849769 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2849770 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2849771 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2849772 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2849773 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2849774 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2849775 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2849776 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2849777 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2849778 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2849779 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2849780 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2849781 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2849782 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2849783 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2849784 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2849785 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2849786 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2849787 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2849788 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2849789 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2849790 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2849791 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2849792 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2849793 with the use of modern technology the control is tighter than china ever had before
2849794 this is an exercise of state power peoples rights are heavily violated is this an olympics or some kind of warfare
2849795 i danced one night in a place there was a club and they asked for a guy to kind of make a striptease and i did it it was for ten minutes i needed money
2849796 my mother was there in the audience she was so proud
2849797 ive never been that way its not my presence i just cant do it but its not been a priority of mine for a while
2849798 two sweaters a pool cue a few cds and a pocketknife from the estate of one of televisions best known faces a man who happened incidentally to be my father
2849799 having to leave my fathers deathbed so that some guy with an ice box could shuck his eyes out while they were fresh still makes me sick and furious to this day
2849800 i was in shock when i received the letter i stood there in my kitchen having four pages of this vomit being thrown at me by someone i thought i had a relationship with i dont hate chris but i dont understand why hes doing this everything he says is untrue
2849801 jerry always said he was so proud that at age 69 he didnt need glasses
2849802 so on his deathbed when they asked if he was an organ donor i said take his eyes chris knew nothing of this he knew nothing of what his father and i discussed for 25 years
2849803 its a very melodramatic gesture but i no longer saw the sense in maintaining a relationship with elaine
2849804 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda
2849805 the doctors were working on him they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2849806 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2849807 so we put up with their bullshit and did nothing
2849808 look heres a pre calculus book were close its somewhere in here

2849817 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2849818 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2849819 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2849820 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2849821 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

2849825 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2849826 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2849827 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2849828 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2849829 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2849830 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2849831 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

2849833 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2849834 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

2849839 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2849840 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2849841 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2849842 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2849843 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2849844 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2849845 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2849846 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2849847 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2849854 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
2849855 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
2849856 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews

2849860 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
2849861 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
2849862 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
2849863 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
2849864 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

2849897 the hardware team started work on the next thing as soon as they were done with their previous project but what they think up doesnt necessarily become a product
2849898 the patients love it we give them a pack developed with healthcare professionals which gives them quite a lot of information about what their condition is about and what they can do about it
2849899 we remind them about the importance of keeping warm the temperature to keep their room at exercising trying to avoid the low temperatures and seeking medical advice at an early stage
2849900 with a small adjustment to their lives in the run up to the cold weather they can significantly reduce the likelihood of their getting poorly
2849901 it helps the patients meaning they do not spend time going in and out of hospital
2849902 overall it has been fairly successful and patients are hoping it will keep going
2849903 the patients last year were contacted two or three times
2849904 this has helped the practice as well as the patients the patients are aware there is a three week period after the cold snap when they are at most risk and are more vigilant
2849905 we are more vigilant too and we know we may expect more patients
2849906 we are thinking of starting a register of weather and ailments because a lot of it so far has been anecdotal and in the distant past was perhaps dismissed by some parts of the medical profession
2849907 we are looking at asthma mental health cardiovascular disease strokes and angina which are all affected by the weather
2849908 if you are at risk of having a heart attack is there something that can be done following an alert from the met office to stop you having one thats an important question
2849909 if there is a cold snap coming patients can get their shopping in beforehand or contact their doctors and get their prescription early so they are not exposed to the low temperatures
2849910 i found this system to be very useful in planning and ordering of medication and adjusting lifestyle to take account of the weather conditions
2849911 being aware of detrimental weather conditions enables people to plan ahead and avoid situations that could aggravate their condition

2849947 it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven
2849948 the father shall take it into consideration and might say yes no or maybe
2849949 letter who are you watching at the 2008 olympic games

2849951 hi this is lance armstrong that was your longest work out yet congratulations
2849952 pope benedicts visit was an enormous gift to us millions of catholics are now more willing to live the catholic life more actively but it is up to us to follow through on this opportunity
2849953 let us be co workers in the renewal of the church that our great pope is leading
2849954 it may seem too ambitious to talk about transforming the world much less doing so by trying to create a civilization that is very different from the one we now live in but the earliest christians did precisely that they did so by their example by holding out the possibility of a life that is higher more beautiful and above all more authentic than the vulgarity violence and greed of the ancient pagan world
2849955 gentlemen we have the power given to us by the holy spirit to transform the world in the same way
2849956 never waver in the cause to ensure legal protection for every human being from the moment of conception to natural death
2849957 today we constantly hear about change we must remember that real change means building a culture of life and real change means building a civilization of love and that means truly transforming our politics in this process of change dealing with the abortion issue is fundamental
2849958 certain moral issues that affect our most fundamental values as catholics and as citizens
2849959 this is especially important since catholics confront a moral dilemma when deciding how to vote can we support a candidate who may be attractive for many reasons but who supports abortion some partisan advocates have sought to excuse support for pro abortion candidates through a complex balancing act they claim that other issues are important enough to set off a candidates support for abortion
2849960 we will never succeed in building a culture of life if we continue to vote for politicians who support a culture of death its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us

2849965 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to forbid the ships and vessels that may be involved in these actions from returning to ukrainian territory until the settlement of the conflict
2849966 what is happening is not because of the separatist regions which have been a headache for georgia for over a decade now but because of democracy in georgia
2849967 russia hates democracy its always been an authoritarian state and always will be this russian aggression is a fight against democracy and the world must defend democracy
2849968 russia has always wanted to see georgia on its knees but it will never achieve that
2849969 i hope that russia will retreat i hope it will break its neck here in the caucasus
2849970 lets stand together against russian aggression and occupation and cheer our troops
2849971 weve been hearing all these years that weve got strong and powerful friends across the ocean but it turned out these stories were just a bluff
2849972 we may be stupid we may have made mistakes but will the us and europe really let russia get away with attacking another country
2849973 oh sorry i should have confirmed saturday at 11am with you

2849980 we have a lot to make up but we are in the time frame right now where we will be able to tell if the pinks are going to return to prince william sound and southeast alaska
2849981 if this was the end of the season we would be very short across the board but we still have another six weeks ahead with the exception of sockeye and chum salmon salmon harvests have been lower than forecast
2849982 but the jury is still out on the pink salmon harvest
2849983 the pink harvest has started to take off in kodiak but remains flat in southeast and prince william sound
2849984 we are seeing poor runs of multiple species across broad geographic areas
2849985 that indicates to me it is probably an ocean problem but mixed in with those were a few runs that were pretty good
