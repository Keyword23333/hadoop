8260000 ironically the instruments of the state have failed to show the same tolerance and restrain in kashmir as was done in jammu
8260001 while the protesters indulging in arson looting and communal attacks in jammu are dealt with enormous caution bullets are brutally being showered on peaceful and unarmed protesters in kashmir
8260002 it seems that some vested interests both within and outside the administration want the vicious cycle of violence to continue in the valley as they are continuously adding fuel to the fire by spraying bullets on the peaceful protesters
8260003 ironically even the curfew passes issued to the local journalists are treated with contempt by the law enforcing agencies discouraging the media fraternity from performing their processional duties

8260011 in face of crisis different states are doing the best they can to come up with band aid solutions
8260012 is this fact the majority of those people without insurance are employed
8260013 whether its 47 million or 45 million uninsured americans thats not an acceptable number
8260014 i realize as difficult times continue you may see people dropping coverage as they lose jobs or employers cut back
8260015 were just as concerned with keeping costs down for those who have coverage as with getting the 45 million into coverage
8260016 our next goal will now be to make the gasoline engine as economical as a diesel all the preconditions for this are provided by our diesotto concept which incorporates the foremost strengths of both the gasoline engine and diesel engine
8260017 in line with the worldwide success of todays diesel engine vehicles equipped with gasoline engines will continue to have a long term attraction for many customers and in many markets
8260018 why dont you idiots just get out of new orleans what kind of fool builds in a bowl below sea level anyway

8260020 will the lord spurn forever and never again be favorable has his steadfast love forever ceased are his promises at an end for all time has god forgotten to be gracious has he in anger shut up his compassion

8260060 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling
8260061 its not raining there are light breezes basically were all in standby
8260062 but my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8260063 they were all members of a family who had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8260064 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus and the department has begun this assessment
8260065 there will be laughter there will be tears and youll learn something about how we can turn the outcome of this disease if we just set our minds to it
8260066 people can call in and talk to their favourite celebrity
8260067 this is what were asking the whole cancer community to do
8260068 put aside your competitive issues and come together for the greater good
8260069 i was too young for woodstock i didnt really start going to concerts until my youngest son was old enough
8260070 i am almost 50 years old and i certainly dont want to be condemned i dont want to be looked upon as some kind of used up dude
8260071 we created this scene we deserve to be there we belong there
8260072 i think its pretty remarkable that i get to see people that are below nine showing up at our festival and then people in their 50s showing up at our festival and they all seem to appreciate and enjoy the music across the board
8260073 i think our partners have always pretty much stood by the fact that were a family festival
8260074 obviously lollapalooza for the last four years hasnt been like lollapalooza of the early 90s
8260075 we are a company of 25 38 as well and we know what we were going to want to go do if we were going to pay the money turns out thats who come to our festivals too
8260076 but we always keep in mind that its getting a little older and thats very interesting especially for lollapalooza
8260077 theres certainly some thought that goes into how do we make the event as broad as possible
8260078 we really wanted to have a whole stage to dedicate to that genre of music to appeal to a little bit of an older audience
8260079 in some cases theres actually three generations that are out there
8260080 when i was growing up in the 60s and 70s the music i was listening to my father was not listening to that music
8260081 now you go forward to 2008 and people are still listening to jimi hendrix
8260082 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8260083 thats nice that at least they have some fun in the drab of assembling technology
8260084 she looks about 12 or 13 to me i dont think stevo is going to be impressed at all it looks a little bit too much like child labor
8260085 nicollette sheridan and michael bolton have amicably ended their engagement
8260086 they appreciate your respect for their privacy in this matter
8260087 ill wrap in a second ill wrap in a second
8260088 i can do the same to you thats what i thought and i said it
8260089 the idea of anyone trying to ban tom brokaw is ludicrous
8260090 they told me technical problems and i have no reason not to believe them
8260091 it would be better for russian prime minister putin and all the reactionary forces to hold their horses a little bit if they want to avoid big problems inside russia because if this becomes a precedent we have only two autonomous entities whereas they have more than 50 i think so apart from russia 50 more countries might emerge there
8260092 this decision i think was just a formality for this had been decided before they were already independent from us and our country could not do much it is bad for us of course that abkhazia and south ossetia do not want to have any ties with us they are completely dependant on russia however so it would be absurd to claim that abkhazias and south ossetias real independence will ever materialize
8260093 weve been expecting this to happen at least us citizens we dont know whether the government did too we knew that all those steps that russia undertook during the last three four months were in fact headed in this direction this is terrible of course i think with this step russia wants to see georgia dismantle its territorial integrity

8260105 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
8260106 if the temperature does not soon recover we will have to conclude that global warming is over
8260107 my guess is that the odds are now at least 50 50 that we will see significant cooling rather than warming in coming decades
8260108 there is absolutely no doubt that the world is in a warming phase
8260109 and that conclusion is supported by 99 of all serious scientists so im certainly not alone in that certainty

8260112 the presidential candidates are hurting their chances with swing voters by reducing their ideas to bumper sticker slogans
8260113 these key voters are going to base their choice on key details about how the candidates will help all americans build lifetime financial security and have access to quality affordable health care
8260114 the good news is that both candidates have a golden opportunity to win over swing voters
8260115 the bad news is that after the longest and most expensive presidential campaign in our history neither side has successfully gotten through on what they specifically want to do and how they plan to do it

8260135 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8260136 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8260137 we were all very interested to see her reasons for supporting barack obama and so i think its very clear tonight that she was a strong messenger that we have to change our country and that its ok even though we supported hillary clinton in the past to unite behind barack obama
8260138 even though i cant vote im trying my best to support obama and get the word out about how great he is and what an inspiration hes going to be
8260139 ive met a lot of women who switched from hillary to mccain just because they were upset so i think its really really important that she came here its a great thing she had everyone on their feet clapping for her it was an inspiring speech and i think that it spoke to everyone
8260140 the words of his speeches inspired the song i didnt write a lyric the only thing i wrote was the melody
8260141 i could say i support barack obama i want him to be the president or i could do an immediate thing

8260169 he had no ill effects as far as the forearm hes getting really close we have got to make sure he feels good tomorrow
8260170 i was pleased with the way i threw the ball most importantly i didnt feel any pain or tightness so hopefully ill feel good tomorrow but so far so good
8260171 well evaluate tomorrow today is just a step and then tomorrow is an evaluation day talked to buddy a little bit on the field he said wed take a look at it tomorrow sit down see whats best and go from there

8260176 the next at bat when i hit the ball to left field he said the magic words
8260177 i understand that im hitting 250 and the fans are expecting a lot more than theyre seeing but the word he said trust me anybody would want to go there
8260178 at this point the safest thing to do is to let it burn
8260179 so that is what everyone is doing is standing back and monitoring the situation

8260184 i would definitely say the multi currency trading is a better way to go this goes along with the simple notion of diversification trading a single strategy currency is essentially putting all your eggs into one basket
8260185 those traders eas that focus on many different currencies will often have higher rates of profitability at times and overall may make more than those trading a single currency
8260186 multicurrency expert advisors are more difficult to develop but i dont consider them to be worse unfortunately metatrader 4 strategy tester does not allow us to test a multicurrency ea it may be this fact that also hinders their development
8260187 neural networks introduce a lot of complexity im very against a trader putting all their faith in a system without fully understanding what it is doing and why it may be running up or drawing down
8260188 whatever type they are i prefer trading systems with the lowest possible number of parameters to be optimized their future results can be at least approximately estimated in the strategy tester the test results and the results in real trading may be directly opposed for systems having a large amount of parameters one of the methods to reduce the number of parameters to be optimized is adaptation of a part of the system parameters which is laid in the algorithm itself
8260189 in my opinion a multicurrency ea is simpler than that based on neural networks
8260190 as of the moment i havent obtained any resulting eas im accumulating experiences now

8260213 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8260214 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8260215 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8260216 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8260217 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8260218 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8260219 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8260220 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

8260223 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8260224 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

8260226 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8260227 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8260235 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8260236 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8260237 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8260238 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8260239 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8260240 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8260241 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8260242 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8260243 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

8260249 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8260250 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8260251 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8260252 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8260253 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8260254 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8260255 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8260256 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8260257 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8260258 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8260259 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8260260 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8260261 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8260262 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8260263 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8260264 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please take care of me
8260265 if you hear the dogs keep going if you see the torches in the woods keep going if theres shouting after you keep going dont ever stop keep going if you want a taste of freedom keep going
8260266 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8260267 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8260268 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8260269 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8260270 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8260271 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8260272 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8260273 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8260274 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8260275 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8260276 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8260277 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8260278 based on our current crop of customers who prefer boulevard look at me cruisers to sports cars there is most likely insufficient demand for a real driving machine
8260279 the thing that disturbs all of us is that for a routine health care need too often someone goes down to the va and stands in line to stand in line to get an appointment to get an appointment
8260280 my friends thats not right and what i intend to do as president is for a routine health care need i intend to give a veteran a plastic card
8260281 to the doctor or the health care provider of their choice and never have to stand in line to stand in line again
8260282 we have got to spend more effort and devote more time to the treatment of the battle wounds both seen and unseen
8260283 theres going to be large numbers of people who are afflicted unfortunately with ptsd and i believe we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
8260284 veterans with illness or injury incurred during their military service
8260285 as today as other occasions i have stated in the plainest most straightforward terms that the veterans health care access card will expand existing benefits
8260286 i dont expect this to deter the obama campaign from misrepresenting my proposals but lest there be any doubt you have my pledge my reforms would not force anyone to go to a non va facility that is my promise they will not signal privatization of the va
8260287 not only has john mccain repeatedly voted no on needed funding for veterans supported by the vfw american legion and disabled american veterans he has now come up with a plan to privatize va health care that the disabled american veterans is saying would be a disservice to veterans
8260288 it isnt a requirement for where they access care or a reduction of services
8260289 in fact the card is an expansion of care for both combat wounded veterans and those veterans receiving broad spectrum care
8260290 the problem with contracting out is the costs are greater than it is for va to treat individuals at va
8260291 so if we send more veterans out into the private sector we start increasing the costs for va health care which then forces va to ration care to those individuals who are within the system so we have concerns about that idea
8260292 for veterans rated 50 percent or higher theres whats called a fee based card that would allow them to go for care in your community if for some reason va cant provide it or if the distance is too far
8260293 the va also has the authority to contract care in situations where individuals are enrolled for va health care and va for whatever reason cant provide those services in house
8260294 we believe if we can correct the funding stream va would be in a better situation to take care of more veterans in a timely fashion
8260295 at one point he had talked about va focusing on combat injuries and combat disabled and veterans looking for routine care would get this card to go elsewhere
8260296 thats kind of changed now from what i heard today hes basically talking about all disabled vets and indigent veterans being cared for by va being able to get that card if they dont have that access but again the details its tough even talking to staff about it theyre not really sure of the details were still working it out and we still continue to talk to them about our concerns about that type of talk
8260297 it was to be expected that the leipzig trade fair would try to keep the topic in its 2009 programme as well by announcing its date but they will have to do it without the industry for the most part the lead trade fair will take place in cologne in 2009 and beyond
8260298 from leipzig we are bringing the clear message that the games industry will be exhibiting in 2009 in cologne at gamescom we have met with broad approval and the industry is looking forward to gathering in cologne whatever happens in germany in 2009 outside of cologne cannot claim to represent this sector
8260299 our fans have always demonstrated nothing but the utmost support for our football team especially over the past few years as we have enjoyed unprecedented success within our program
8260300 this new website marks our mission to always make sure we are increasing our level of customer service it features everything a demon deacon fan should know about a gameday at bb amp t field this information has always been available but as our fans rely more heavily on the internet to provide them information we decided that they deserve to have their own football gameday site
8260301 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8260302 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8260303 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8260304 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8260305 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8260306 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8260307 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8260308 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8260309 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8260310 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8260311 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8260312 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8260313 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8260314 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8260315 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8260316 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8260317 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8260318 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8260319 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8260320 is there anything else you want me to look at
8260321 these three events add up to a planet in deep trouble

8260325 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8260326 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8260327 over the last two years the safeayr initiative has been more successful than any of us could have imagined
8260328 ayr town centre remains one of the safest places for people to enjoy the pubs clubs and restaurants
8260329 this has been achieved by the hard work and dedication of all the partners and in particular strathclyde police and the council i would like to congratulate the local licensees shopkeepers taxis and private hire operators who have all enthusiastically embraced safeayr together we have made a real difference
8260330 this project has proven to be an excellent example of the success that can be achieved through partnership working
8260331 ayr town centre can be a very busy place right into the early hours of the morning over weekend periods
8260332 the previous success of the project leaves no room for complacency and the challenge remains to build on this level of success and aim for continuous improvement with the aim of addressing local issues and making ayr town centre safer
8260333 in partnership with south ayrshire council i will continue to commit extra police officers into ayr town centre providing high visibility policing and traditional enforcement to ensure public reassurance for the majority of people who are there for a good night out and also to target those responsible for intimidating and antisocial behaviour

8260462 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8260463 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8260464 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8260890 we totally believe that barack obama is not qualified to be the president
8260891 he doesnt have the resume and hillary was the most experienced
8260892 and frankly the election was stolen from her starting with michigan he wasnt even on the ballot and they took four of her delegates and gave them to him that was when all the corruption started

8260930 great head has more than just penis action to it there are the balls to suck and roll around with the tongue and go back to the penis slowly tickling the head ever so playfully and motions of up and down the penis with the tongue ever so playfully it takes having them tell the woman they are about to come and have the woman pull gently on his balls as a man can not come when his balls are descended for when a man has an orgasm his balls go up also stop moving while doing this gentle pulling down of the balls
8260931 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction
8260932 its obviously been a factor playing on the minds of oil markets at the moment

8260935 as a turbine blade goes around it creates lift like an airplanes wings and there is a small zone of dropping pressure maybe a meter or so in diameter on the tips of the blades
8260936 bats fly through this area and their lungs expand and the fine capillaries around the edges of the lungs burst
8260937 we compare it to divers they are pretty much dying of the bends
8260938 bats can actually detect pressure changes but were talking large scale relatively slow changes like the coming of a storm front
8260939 they are the first to have done a large scale look at this barotrauma
8260940 but ultimately it might not matter so much how the bats die but what is attracting them to the turbines in the first place
8260941 weve partnered with industry and federal agencies to raise and spend about two million dollars looking for a solution
8260942 bats are not being killed at all the wind projects all over the country it is happening in some places and not others
8260943 were trying to determine before construction what areas might be risky
8260944 a large portion of the kills occur at the lowest wind speeds
8260945 and at those low speeds the turbines are not generating appreciable electricity anyway
8260946 it wont eliminate the problem but its a good step in the right direction

8260955 that statue is not going to resolve anything sitting there its throwing taxpayers money into the trash can
8260956 i just picture an imposing structure at the entrance of san juan bay which can be seen by air sea and land and which will be a landmark in united states territory where christopher columbus actually landed

8261029 through acoa our government is committed to helping atlantic canadas ocean technology companies access the skills and knowledge they need to develop innovative products for the increasingly competitive ocean technology sector
8261030 thanks to our investment of more than 1 million memorials marine institute will be in a position to expand its capacity in marine research and training
8261031 the facility will give ocean technology companies access to the skills and knowledge they need to develop innovative products for the global ocean technology sector
8261032 a wide scope of education training and applied research in support of the marine industrial and oil and gas sectors
8261033 it will provide training to industry clients and support research related to ocean technology including marine environmental studies marine ecotourism diving and oil spill response acoa has provided the institute with significant funding over the years to help grow our capabilities we look forward to working with the town of holyrood and other players to make this centre as successful as our sert centre in stephenville
8261034 this has been a great year the cast performed every day and three nights a week staging the various productions including faces of fort royal spirit walks and the cabaret the attendance numbers were very good with a large number of visitors taking in the shows throughout the summer
8261035 service canada is glad to provide funding that gives young people in the community the opportunity to develop skills
8261036 our culture is a valuable asset that binds us as newfoundlanders ad labradorians
8261037 through compelling performances path draws both residents and visitors alike as they recount historical events significant not only to the area but the entire province
8261038 groups such as the cape st marys performance serices tramore productions and path made tremendous contributions to the cultural and heritage traditions of the region
8261039 as well they play a key role in developing our tourist industry i am pleased that our government continues to support these programs and i welcome the investments
8261040 im going to be looking for how the promises there are going to be kept especially with regard to the use of our labour
8261041 an awful lot more is going to have to be done to ensure that we have the capacity
8261042 i want to see more around training because what the government is doing is insufficient we need a lot more work around the apprenticeship program issue
8261043 if that doesnt happen they arent going to come back
8261044 you want to ask the question of how many million person hours of employment are going out of the province because of that one
8261045 should there be any significant cost overruns or environmental liabilities the people of the province will be on the hook for a portion of those costs that risk could have been eliminated through a revamped and strengthened royalty regime
8261046 entering into an agreement like this where youre talking billions of dollars that has to translate somehow into our municipalities in the form of infrastructure
8261047 with hebron we are launching a new era of energy projects in which we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource developments
8261048 we have quite a bit of work to be done to finalize numbers given the early stages that were in today
8261049 the first thing we have to do is get the core team back my hope would be that sometime into the early part of next year well have the full complement of resources
8261050 much of the construction will likely start in the 2013 2014 range so theres a lot of engineering work to be done
8261051 theres a significant amount of work here as much as we can handle and more
8261052 weve got the lead time to build the capacity it gives lots of lead time for people to come back and work in the province so we can gear up and well take whatever we can handle
8261053 weve focused on the eight to 10 components that really fit our long term strategy and can be built here in our yards and can be moved around effectively
8261054 we think weve structured this in a fashion to get as much work and experience as we can in our available yards and infrastructure as well as protecting the economics of the project
8261055 if were going to be full partners in the industry then you have to behave like partners
8261056 this is not an unusual challenge for the industry but when we have a partner like the province here were comfortable we can work this out
8261057 getting formal agreements done is one step in a long journey

8261097 his society has received several claims of family ties to the president over the years and those wishing to test their dna against that of a madison family descendant can do so through an online genetic testing service a method he called objective and without racial bias
8261098 there was no way to verify genetically or historically whether the so called madison dna being used for the test would be valid if the test came back negative he said it would prove nothing but kearses claim might still be dismissed as false

8261129 if you put it in a frame and take care of it
8261130 it had that feeling like we were going to win it every single inning
8261131 we had a pretty good feeling an excitement because we put ourselves in position to win the game on many occassions it was definitely exciting it probably felt like the little league world series players you forget that you get paid to play the game its almost like we felt like little kids with the excitement in kind of playoff type atmosphere which is pretty normal when we play the mets
8261132 i started to put bruntlett in the game and i told jimy williams that i want to save bruntlett to hit
8261133 ruiz has been catching balls at third base and working out there and actually he was an infielder before they made him a catcher in the minor leagues at that time i thought what have we got to lose we needed a run i wanted to keep bruntlett back to hit for the pitcher who had a good chance of hitting
8261134 i said no because victorino might break for the plate
8261135 we knew we had something special here and it seems many other people think the same thing
8261136 condemns the decision of the russian federation to extend recognition to the south ossetia and abkhazia regions of georgia and calls upon russia to reverse its decision
8261137 russias decision violates the many un security council resolutions it has endorsed regarding georgias territorial integrity and is inconsistent with the fundamental osce principles on which stability in europe is based
8261138 georgias recovery security and stability are important to the alliance
8261139 russias actions have called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus nato calls on russia to respect georgias territorial integrity

8261154 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8261155 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8261156 but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8261157 i saw some of my colleagues standing up and applauding for obama for the first time
8261158 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8261159 farewell and thanks to the greatest player in 169 years of sussex history
8261160 by establishing the emergency preparedness grants program the bcbsnc foundation recognized that responding to disasters is not just about providing relief it also calls for reform of emergency management systems so they perform at optimum levels when the next situation comes thats particularly important for the most vulnerable members of our society who are often hit the hardest
8261161 i applaud the bcbsnc foundations efforts and hope other community groups and funding organizations follow their lead
8261162 north carolina is prone to severe weather and the far reaching effects of hurricane katrina continue to remind us of the fact that we must be prepared
8261163 we hope that this report will be a resource for organizations across the state that aid in responding to the public during a disaster or emergency
8261164 our intent is that the original investment made in the grants program will be multiplied through increased community awareness this report will be an important tool in achieving that goal
8261165 nunca tarde para colocar a grinalda mesmo que aos 39 minutos do segundo tempo
8261166 as we head toward a quarter of a century of celebrating literature i am proud to see that the fair continues to be a vibrant important part of south floridas cultural landscape
8261167 our programs this year will reflect the preoccupations as well as the joys of our community and our nation
8261168 russians have been in london for some time because its close to moscow and its very international and you have seen them active in the property market
8261169 i strongly believe this is a multi year cycle but you have to be a lot more selective and distinguish between commodities
8261170 some people have been hit very badly financially so there has been forced liquidation
8261171 if people were to go and buy a basket of these completely bombed out companies although they might not have picked the bottom the upside potential is tremendous
8261172 even if prices stabilise at current levels earnings are going to be negligible for people producing zinc and there will be huge downgrades for nickel producers too
8261173 the energy market is still very tight including coal and uranium will become tight as time goes by
8261174 we havent really seen huge outflows and in fact over the past week our flows have been pretty positive
8261175 people will always try to pick the bottom of the market but it the selling will probably go on for a bit longer
8261176 i dont think it is a turnaround in sentiment but if you look at the extent of the falls they far outweigh any fundamental analysis or rational behaviour
8261177 c est une des premi res fois que l on identifie et d nonce autant
8261178 this is a significant step tuesday for me to be out there on the practice field
8261179 if things go as we hope they do and expect they do then i definitely see myself practicing full time next week and playing against the bears
8261180 every day you hope youre making progress and you wake up the next morning and hope you still feel good so far thats been what weve been dealing with
8261181 it all depends on the players that are out there and maybe what our needs are
8261182 oung big tough and have potential for development like all teams in the nfl right now they will be looking for offensive lineman and tight ends the dolphins will also be looking for good young receivers who can play in the kicking game
8261183 before each game we talk about the players not only how we are going to play them but how things are going then after the game we talk about them again relative to how they played and relative to how we are going to practice them or use them the following week in practice
8261184 obviously they want to give a good accounting of themselves whether theyre handing it off or whether theyre making a play on a naked or a screen or a drop back pass we just want to see where theyre at with our system
8261185 i hope we get some good quality time there and try to make an impression with this team
8261186 thats what im trying to do just do the best i can and not have any mental mistakes
8261187 the first thing that comes to mind is how much fun ive had
8261188 its still football a touchdown is still six points but theres just so much more that goes into it
8261189 but definitely i feel good about what ive done im not satisfied or content with the way things have gone but its definitely a great opportunity for me
8261190 weve got i think roughly 10 sacks in three games weve got some guys individually that are rushing well hadnt played complete games you envision those guys putting a lot of pressure on the quarterback i think linebacker lamarr woodley has created a lot of pressure in the time that hes played linebacker james harrison linebacker lawrence timmons defensive end aaron smith has two sacks i like where our pass rush is if you project the performance of those men over four quarters i like where it is
8261191 well know before the game but it could go up to the game
8261192 it just depends on how fast he gets his strength back you would love to be able to predict it and say hey we know whats going to happen but theres just no way to know we want him to play and he wants to play
8261193 next year 10 or 11 wins the year after that its a super bowl
8261194 i know that the light at the end of the tunnel is very very bright
8261195 it may seem a bit dim saturday night in miami groans from the audience
8261196 i know that this will come out as something very very special and as bill said a three year plan is better than a five year plan
8261197 im sitting here listening to three year plans and five year plans
8261198 hes a good player and itd be nice to have him sure

8261204 i have urgent goods to be delivered we are stuck because of road blockade for past three days without anything to eat or drink we cover a distance of three four kilometers to get water its very troublesome during the night the goons are stealing fuel from our vehicles and are asking for money where will we get the money from
8261205 nobody is listening mamta banerjee is sitting on protest will her blocking the roads solve the problem will disrupting the traffic and troubling the people solve the problem when the company was being made and the plot was taken at that time they should have done something when everything is complete they are blocking the road this is causing only trouble for the public
8261206 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8261207 the current spike in the price of oil means these companies are receiving unearned and undeserved windfall profits that are damaging to the rest of society not least because the unprecedented price rises are fuelling inflation and therefore the cost of borrowing and repaying mortgages
8261208 there are three simple questions to ask are the energy companies making extra and excessive profits have they done anything to earn them should these profits be retained solely for the benefit of shareholders and company executives
8261209 two thirds of voters and even 57 of tory voters support it along with 70 mps its hardly surprising there is outrage at their record profits up six fold in three years while prices rise by as much as 35
8261210 there are millions of people for whom this coming winter spells abject misery as they struggle with the conundrum of whether to buy food for the table or respite from the chill

8261216 grote ict projecten zijn te complex om door organisaties en ministeries zonder vorm zelf begeleiding uit te voeren

8261222 the chancellor renewed her call for the immediate enforcement of the six point ceasefire plan
8261223 there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8261224 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8261225 we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners

8261241 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8261242 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8261243 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8261244 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8261245 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8261246 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8261247 we dared not release the results of the study for fear of being howled down as environmental vandals
8261248 thank goodness its happening early enough before winter so manufacturers can ramp up
8261249 we think more people will be looking at these heating sources they are renewable the pellets come from forests that are managed
8261250 in europe theyve been using wood pellets for years in the u s weve been so focused on oil it took a clunk on the head to wake us up
8261251 when i thought about what i spent for oil last year
8261252 i just didnt want to get caught without any so we bought them
8261253 i always wanted a fireplace so this works for me
8261254 but youve got to be patient the manufacturers cant make them fast enough
8261255 with all the uncertainties these days people will want these as alternatives or backups for heat
8261256 they are no longer a curiosity as they were in the 70s and 80s
8261257 it started in june and now everything is back ordered
8261258 it has been overwhelming were now talking february for most stoves

8261265 la ficci n es uno de los pilares de la programaci n de telecinco llevamos a os invirtiendo en series y tenemos la suerte de poder combinar t tulos que ya tienen un recorrido consolidado con proyectos nuevos
8261266 todos alguna vez hemos tenido la fantas a de preguntarnos qu habr a pasado si hubi ramos nacido en otra familia en un entorno diferente o en otras circunstancias sta es la base de la historia que viven en sus propias carnes las protagonistas de la serie sara y rebeca son hermanas pero no lo saben ya que en el momento en el que nacieron fueron separadas el azar que tanto influye en la vida provoca que un d a cualquiera se produzca un encuentro fortuito entre las j venes dando lugar a una historia extremadamente entra able y divertida que combina elementos sentimentales y de comedia que es una de las claves que caracteriza a este proyecto y que ya hemos manejado en yo soy bea
8261267 las dos actrices se cruzan huyendo de sus problemas rebeca mendoza es una chica de clase alta con educaci n y formaci n que viene de una familia unida estricta exitosa y due os de una constructora ella est enamorada de un hombre que su familia repudia y huye de su padre por otro lado sara est cansada de las discusiones con su madre ella es una so adora que busca la fama y que cree que las cosas se consiguen con menos esfuerzo del que emplea rebeca
8261268 el contraste no estar s lo en las personalidades de las protagonistas sino en los ambientes en los que han crecido durante el tiempo que han estado separadas la constructora por un lado es el mundo de los negocios de la exigencia del xito y de condiciones econ micas de bienestar por otro lado el mundo del barrio y de la plaza est poblado por personajes que tienen su peque o negocio una tienda un restaurante o una peluquer a como es el caso de la madre de sara estos entornos presentan dos formas de abordar la vida produciendo inevitablemente un choque cuando estos universos entran en contacto
8261269 sta es una historia de amor hemos hecho una labor de adaptaci n de profundizar en el concepto realizando los cambios necesarios para que cumpliera con las expectativas y la parrilla de telecinco y con las caracter sticas de la sociedad espa ola

8261276 cloud computing is one of those catch all buzz words that tries to encompass a variety of aspects ranging from deployment load balancing provisioning business model and architecture like web2
8261277 i view cloud computing as a broad array of web based services aimed at allowing users to obtain a wide range of functional capabilities on a pay as you go basis that previously required tremendous hardware software investments and professional skills to acquire cloud computing is the realization of the earlier ideals of utility computing without the technical complexities or complicated deployment worries
8261278 i think clouds are the next hype term for the next year or two people are coming to grips with virtualization and how it reshapes it creates service and software based models and in many ways changes a lot of the physical layer we are used to clouds will be the next transformation over the next several years building off of the software models that virtualization enabled

8261295 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8261296 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8261297 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8261298 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8261299 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8261300 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people

8261312 does one person like the archbishop of canterbury for instance have a corner on the truth market
8261313 has one particular group been given the gift of pure truth and the rest of us just cant hear it
8261314 i dont think so right now the how of coming to the truth is as important as getting to the truth right now the way in which the anglican communion goes about the search for the elusive truth is as important as the truth itself

8261317 der grund daf r ist in zwei aspekten zu suchen
8261318 wer sich auf eigene kosten impfen l sst muss mit kosten in h he von etwa 450 euro rechnen
8261319 die viren werden durch geschlechtsverkehr bertragen und haben eine inkubationszeit von zehn bis 15 jahren
8261320 der erste liegt bei etwa 30 jahren also entsprechend zehn bis 15 jahren nach dem ersten geschlechtsverkehr
8261321 der grund daf r kann sein dass die ehe gescheitert der partner gestorben ist oder die frau einfach in eine midlifecrises kommt
8261322 wir k nnen noch nicht sagen wie hoch die prozentuale heilungsquote ist sind uns aber sicher dass die impfung sinnvoll und n tzlich ist
8261323 wir glauben da wurde ein hoch riskanter test auf den markt gebracht der nicht ausreichend klinisch getestet wurde und der die gesundheit der bev lkerung gef hrden k nnte

8261331 das internet bietet software zur analyse und datenwiederherstellung um die bilder zu retten ohne dass die speicherkarte zu einem labor eingeschickt werden und man lange zeit um die bilder bangen muss
8261332 wichtig ist auch dass die bilder regelm ig auf ein anderes speichermedium bertragen werden und nicht auf der speicherkarte lagern hierbei sollte man genau berlegen wo die bilder archiviert werden

8261399 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8261400 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8261401 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8261402 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

8261404 presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8261405 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial
8261406 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8261407 esta situaci n se alan sucede porque carabineros act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8261408 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8261409 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8261410 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
8261411 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8261412 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8261413 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos
8261414 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios

8261422 the asian and in particular the indian markets offer a compelling investment opportunity
8261423 the mayur hedge fund is well positioned to effectively tap into these trends to the benefit of its investors
8261424 however the economy is not dependent on foreign money as it is underpinned by domestic institutional money such as domestic life insurance companies which are amongst the biggest investors at present
8261425 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen

8261452 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

8261456 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8261457 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8261458 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8261459 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8261460 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8261461 there was a disposal earlier this year from one of theoriginal investors and it would appear that on the back of thatthere have been some expressions of interest

8261463 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8261464 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
8261465 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
8261466 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
8261467 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
8261468 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
8261469 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8261470 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8261471 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8261472 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8261473 no se ha registrado ratificaci n del convenio 169 por parte de chile en la oit chile no ha presentado los instrumentos de ratificaci n
8261474 todos los convenios de la oit sin excepci n no admiten ninguna reserva o declaraci n interpretativa
8261475 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8261476 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8261477 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8261478 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8261479 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8261480 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8261481 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8261482 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8261483 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8261484 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8261490 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8261491 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8261492 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8261493 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8261518 well we could play dueling experts all day long common sense tells us
8261519 stating that the id people considered the conference a private meeting and did not want any of us to discuss it blog it or publish anything about it they said they had no intention of posting anything from the conference on the discovery institutes web site the entire proceedings were recorded they claimed they would have some announcement at the time of the publication of the edited volume of presentations in about a year and wanted all of us to wait until then to say anything
8261520 researchers active in mathematical computational and experimental biology who while acknowledging that there are philosophical differences in the various approaches represented at the conference will focus on the biological data and its mathematical analysis with the purpose of assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach as a scientific research program not as an ideological stance in a culture war
8261521 the reasonable implication was that extensive public discussion of the symposium content before the release of the proceedings particularly commentary of the sort offered by brooks aimed at undermining the symposium would be extremely bad form and a gross breach of academic etiquette
8261522 the symposium is a closed research conference so neither the media nor members of the public will be present
8261523 truly it is by the remembrance of allah that hearts find rest
8261524 martin kaymer and schuco teeing off for a successful future with energy2
8261525 what brings us together is the professional approach we both take to what we do
8261526 striving for the highest standards of professionalism and a strong commitment to climate protection are both things that matter to me a lot in schuco ive found a partner with the same goals that i have thats why im so glad to be working together with them
8261527 this is definitely a win win situation where everybody stands to benefit including the customers
8261528 because of the success of the first one by the time the label was ready for another one we werent ready
8261529 musics gotta come out when you live its not coming out with a new product line its not like making a bunch of chips ahoy cookies it was still our stuff but we still felt it was a little rushed
8261530 we did it in one day shy of three weeks
8261531 it was recorded live we worked with a different producer steve jordan and the process was real fun we had it set up like we were doing a live show somewhere a small set of drums a twin and a little bass amp and we recorded like that on some of the songs it came across good
8261532 i cant say i was fully prepared for what was going to happen in there
8261533 wed talked with steve a little bit and told him were a live band and to be able to capture that in the studio is kind of tough its a feeling and a spontaneous moment in that response you get from people that youre feeding off of nothing can prepare you for what you dont know in the studio but the vibe was really good
8261534 it was like a big family when steve jordan left there he wasnt jordan anymore he was steve garza
8261535 its that simple formula less is more were just keeping it back to the roots like when heart wont tell a lie was written i didnt think wed ever record it or even do it because it was just something that came out all the songs on there are close to our hearts theyre like our children because they come from us
8261536 im a man yes i am and i cant help but love you so
8261537 apparently the night before hed been wanting to pitch a cover for us to do and that was the song that he was going to pitch and he was just freaking out we considered it a good omen and rolled with it it wasnt something we planned wed never even played it before for that matter we learned it a little bit live and what you hear is what we did
8261538 we didnt know anything about the mayan calendar we started hearing about what it meant and we saw it in the new indiana jones movie then we saw it on the history channel and we were like we tapped into some kind of universal wave we didnt know about not to sound like lunatics or nothing but were spiritual believers in the good lord jesus christ were not perfect and were not churchgoers by any means but were believers
8261539 we have a core group and we all kind of need our fix this is something we all talk about how after the fact we go through devotional withdrawal for two and a half days thats all thats going on for us george bush isnt a person the world doesnt hate us the economy isnt a piece of shit its one thing were passionate about and it makes the world better for us
8261540 probably the highest quality archival footage ive seen of the band from that era
8261541 because there isnt going to be a member of the band there and not as rigid a schedule its going to be a bit more laid back people hanging out and chatting rather than being focused on the thing going on at the time which is good because these things are incredibly hectic
8261542 i think itll be the whole band but at least band founders mark mothersbaugh and jerry casale
8261543 that will be new for us because weve had trouble getting mark to the event so itll be our first chance to have mark answer questions mark will have his mac laptop backstage well have a mac laptop onstage here hooked up to a video system so people can see it there will probably be a moderator sitting next to a laptop itll be live interaction with the band we looked for other ways to draw people to the event because nobody from the band was going to be there were also going to be premiering new devo songs theyre working on for their new album
8261544 im trying to make it as devo as i can
8261545 theres a spirit of devo thats hard to capture but theres also a technique and style of devo that cool industrial look that also looked like 50s advertising art also theres the art of mark mothersbaugh that postcard art he does and since i met him 25 years ago thats rubbed off on me
8261546 it was 1973 i found an ad looking for musicians that chris had posted in a sweet shop
8261547 it described this band that had a record deal and was influenced by the velvet underground the kinks and glenn miller but there werent any other band members and i was the only person who responded and the record deal was just one of chris fanciful dreams the first of many actually but i recognized that we really had something and always knew we would be successful at it
8261548 i think there are really five essential squeeze albums and they each capture a particular time of the band
8261549 cool for cats argybargy and east side story show a progression of a certain maturity i think our earlier records were some of our most adventurous play was released on warner in 1991 and then the label dropped us immediately after it came out a amp m released some fantastic place in 1993 and a amp m also dropped us immediately
8261550 drum machines tended to drift and moogs could be unpredictable now we can use digital samplers for those and it sounds great
8261551 ive really learned a lot about the fans from these smaller shows
8261552 it really redefined what radio was not only in cleveland but nationally it really pushed the envelope
8261553 it was a unique place at a unique time in both clevelands history and popular culture in general
8261554 we broke more new music out of cleveland than anywhere else in the country it was also considered to have the best news weather and sports our success was due to teamwork and a drive to survive and thrive we wanted to be the worlds greatest rock n roll station and we pulled it off
8261555 whereas the united states armed forces and allied forces are performing their missions with great courage and distinction in carrying out air land and sea attacks against iraqi military targets and
8261556 resolved by the house of representatives the senate concurring that the congress expresses the unequivocal support and appreciation of the nation
8261557 2 to the members of the united states armed forces serving in operation iraqi freedom who are carrying out their missions with excellence patriotism and bravery and
8261558 3 to the families of the united states military personnel serving in operation iraqi freedom who are providing support and prayers for their loved ones currently engaged in military operations in iraq
8261559 a few years ago i had the opportunity to study improv comedy in chicago under tina fey i quickly realized that humor builds bridges a church handing out shot glasses thats funny
8261560 what we discover from the scriptures is that jesus spent more time in bars and parties than he ever did in temples
8261561 participants employ teamwork rules of engagement leadership and high tech equipment as they take part in a virtual u s army mission
8261562 in our wildest dreams or nightmares we never imagined that one day wed see in the united states of america a game in which kids as young as 13 would be encouraged to kill would be given a kill score and be taught that soldiers live in make believe shooting galleries where no one sees a drop of blood or suffers the horrors of combat or retains the scars of having killed somebody
8261563 nor could we have believed that this game would be promoted at a festival billed as a wholesome family event right now we can all wonder what kind of looking glass weve fallen through as a society
8261564 it should remind us that violence is a long standing part of what it means to be human
8261565 but that it is part of a curse upon the human race
8261566 they may be able to beat the game but they wont be able to beat the reality of war
8261567 who can argue that violence is an epidemic in the united states especially among our children
8261568 so if were caught up in a dangerous epidemic isnt it sensible to try to end that epidemic
8261569 only pittsburgh and new orleans have seen sharper population declines this decade and new orleans was because of a natural disaster
8261570 we want to determine if the work the outside contractors say they are doing is actually being done
8261571 with high standby charges the economics of on site generation go down because i always need backup power if my on site generation goes offline
8261572 thered be no point in paying standby fees the extra costs dont make economic sense
8261573 were flexible and have multiple generators you could arrange yourself like us but you have to spend a lot of money to do it
8261574 maybe they dont want to wait two years to break ground
8261575 waste heat is a natural resource thats cheaper than any other resource
8261576 ohio needs to change how the electric industry is regulated
8261577 but this is also the most politically difficult barrier to overcome in the meantime its easier working with sb 221
8261578 right now its amorphous what will the specific benchmarks be for different energy markets
8261579 we need clarity on how the aep translates into dollars

8261625 not to say he wasnt when he went in there
8261626 most of this fringe stuff is actually possible which makes it interesting and scary at the same time
8261627 a rogue a brilliant nomad who doesnt really know what his purpose is
8261628 hes essentially the bridge between walters techno babble and english
8261629 he serves to say ok those are the four things that make sense and then these are the 16 things that dont make sense
8261630 shes straight down the line fbi who has been exposed to this other world and is reeling from trying to comprehend it
8261631 she wrangles peter and walter in and maintains the focus of the trio
8261632 we were talking about how much we missed working on a tv show together
8261633 though that character was very different from walter bishop we thought theres a series about a guy like this
8261634 the truth is that the fans of lost or alias are the people we are beholden to
8261635 i actually dont think of them as fans the people who are into those shows are also fans of the shows that i am interested in
8261636 i cant tell you how surreal a dream that is for me

8261757 when becky adlington won gold in beijing it brought it all back to me how it felt to triumph at the olympics i had a tear in my eye and a lump in my throat as it is 48 years since i took gold in the breast stroke in rome
8261758 i had held that record for too long and i was delighted with how becky did she is a lovely girl and her swimming is fantastic i knew she could win the 800 metres but the 400m is a bit harder however the italian girl did a bad race and becky was a total body length ahead
8261759 when im not reporting on cycling i do the swimming so i have commentated on both rebecca adlington and chris hoy
8261760 i really admire chris hoy because he was good at the 1km time trial but it was taken out of this years olympics and so he had to re jig his training he did such a sensational job i think that we should be hearing the words arise sir chris and rebecca adlington being made a dame
8261761 having hugh porter way next to aldersley leisure village named after me about five years ago was a great honour
8261762 i was born in myatt avenue in parkfields and grew up in that area when anita and i first got married we moved to pattingham
8261763 a lot of people dont realise that anita and i are married we met on a plane from hong kong to tokyo for the 1964 olympics and as we were the only people awake we started talking
8261764 for those olympics i was one of the top seeds but i had a chest infection that ended up as bronchitis i still competed and finished fifth i dont think the training today is much different to what i did
8261765 however when i was training i had to monitor it all myself whereas now every ride they do is filmed and analysed on computers they use wind tunnels and train in rooms that are the same humidity as it is in beijing
8261766 we arrived back in england on sunday and we are still jet lagged
8261767 however i have still been out this morning for a 31 mile ride
8261768 i mainly do aerobics to keep fit now as i cant swim in the public baths when there are so many people jumping in and bumping into me last time i went one man kept getting in my way and so i did breast stroke legs and gave him a good kick he didnt bother me after that
8261769 i went to patshull hotel to go swimming and someone said to me you should have come in yesterday we had an olympic swimmer visit us i wondered who it was and it turned out it was me
8261770 in the world championships in manchester at easter we won nine world titles but we couldnt have all those disciplines at the olympics
8261771 i thought we might win seven but we came away with eight gold medals and broke three world records i was overjoyed
8261772 for the first time i had to do live commentating on the bmx racing that was my baptism of fire as i had never done it before so i went to madrid earlier this year to watch some bmx racing and then went to switzerland in may to spend three days with the british team and get to know the rules of the race and the profiles of the people
8261773 david brailsford is a great motivator who is at the top of a pyramid of people who all have to deliver gold medals or their funding is cut
8261774 everyone in the pyramid has to be the best as well as the coaches and psychologist steve peters who works at a maximum security prison
8261775 steve had a key position in the jigsaw for the olympic cyclists as his job was to talk to the team fill them with confidence and ensure they were focussed on their goal
8261776 i stayed in the media village in beijing and had a large bedsit
8261777 they left lots of little gifts for us such as a painting that had been done by the children of china also when hugh went to the bank he was given a set of chopsticks as a present
8261778 i have heard that for the 2012 olympics we are going to be able to pick our events
8261779 i believe the 1km is going to be reinstated which is good because we have so much talent coming up
8261780 in britain we have just two 250 metre velodromes we have fewer than they do in paris and there are eight indoor cycle tracks in germany we should have another velodrome for 2012 and we deserve it as we have just produced eight olympic medals
8261781 we will do even better in 2012 as we have some superb youngsters coming through and becky was an example of the hard training taking place
8261782 chris hoy is 36 years old so he may still be happy to do the olympics in 2012 or it could be jason kenny who is our champion
8261783 the amount of talent that is coming through is so frightening that there will be some excellent riders that will not get a place on the great britain team for 2012
8261784 i think for us to be as impressive in 2012 we have to be typically british and use our famous names and the history that we are so proud of
8261785 we know what our jewels are and it is important that we show the world what we have to offer in britain

8262086 i realize theres essentially no reason left to watch the team except the pure love of baseball but tedious and repetitive is tedious and repetitive no matter how likely or not

8262088 beyonce told her to wear that shit it looks like she got mad at beyonce so she kicked a baby skunk in the ass and got stuck
8262089 beyonce probably took some of her old weave hair superglued it to some payless shoes and told solange that this was some limited edition shit straight from tokyo
8262090 are you sure these shoes didnt come from that fake bigfoot costume they kind of smell like fish guts and moonshine

8262115 we are expecting the smartphone market to grow strongly with royalty free operating systems like symbian android and linux pushing deeper down into product portfolios
8262116 apples iphone isnt huge in sales volume but it helped energize the market people are now walking into stores and asking for a smartphone something that didnt really happen in the past
8262117 royalty free operating systems will help reduce the cost of handsets in the future
8262118 operators will push phone makers to get more smartphones to the market since it is easier for them to deploy services
8262119 nokia has a strong foothold in the smartphone category already and that will continue to be the case but others such as blackberry maker research in motion are working their way up
8262120 going forward samsung is transitioning well toward smartphones while lg is still struggling a bit it is hard to say what sony ericsson will do but we dont expect its xperia x1 to make a big sales splash when released later this year
8262121 the economic environment continued to negatively impact mobile phones sales in both mature and emerging markets
8262122 consumers in mature markets continued to favor mid tier devices over high end devices while new subscribers continued to join mobile networks in emerging markets during the quarter
8262123 startet er dann zum beispiel gmail mit einer neuen e mail in der entwurfsansicht
8262124 right now a couple positions are up for grabs as far as whos going to start
8262125 then i think its fair to say too because of the competition well probably play a couple different players at several positions and just kind of continue the evaluation on for a little bit until the picture becomes a little bit more clear
8262126 those are all pretty even battles right now and well just kind of keep watching until something becomes clear
8262127 but i think weve had pretty good competition and thats been pleasing to see
8262128 realistically nobody else was really ready to play at least we didnt feel like they were
8262129 the big difference is right now we know a lot more about jake hes got experience very valuable experience and hes used that experience and then rick stanzi has grown to me were a lot healthier at the position than we were a year ago and thats encouraging
8262130 christensen came in as a starter and i think hes practiced well
8262131 its not a matter of his performance hes elevated his performance from the spring i thought he was better in the spring than he was in the fall and i think hes continued to improve which is what were hoping for
8262132 and then the other factor is that rick stanzi quite honestly a year ago wasnt really a factor in the race or maybe we would have seen him but i dont think he was in the discussion seriously a year ago that this time
8262133 you get an idea of where youre at from the coaches where they see you at
8262134 but coach ferentz tells us not to worry about it so we dont worry about it
8262135 you know right now im pretty confident were going to do well at the running back position
8262136 a merrill possui o grande privil gio de sobreviver a tantas crises durante um longo per odo de tempo

8262139 theres a potential impact on production in the gulf of mexico area

8262141 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8262142 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8262143 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8262144 hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8262145 anyone who saw her speech monday night knows she will be a great first lady for america
8262146 the only way we lose this election is through a lack of unity i know many hillary supporters who are now with barack i hope that feeling takes hold across the country
8262147 he would tell you he struggled in the spring and we expected that
8262148 he was new to the system everything was new to him but he took the next step too he was performing pretty well this camp but it was stiff competition probably the difference between him and a younger player is his clock is running right now i dont want to speak for him but im sure that was in his mind
8262149 i think all of us were concerned after the season last year with what was going to develop at that position
8262150 right now im pretty confident that were going to play well at the running back position
8262151 the jury is still out because we havent played a snap that counts but based on what weve seen were pretty optimistic that were going to be productive in the backfield and thats good to see
8262152 its one thing to go out and play but if you cant play effectively
8262153 thats going to be the next hurdle for him but at least it looks like the repair was good and were not dealing with something really severe here
8262154 weve got to make sure its completely healed because last year we thought it was healed it came back and i had to sit out again and sit out and sit out so were trying to prevent that
8262155 were trying to make sure everything is good to go it might be today it might be tomorrow
8262156 its hard to believe were entering 10 and thats a good thing at least i think it is some people may not im happy with it and i hope i can make 11
8262157 i hope i can tell you more about it at hot chips next year
8262158 thank you so much for the opportunity to go to cranks castle weve had such a lovely time its so peaceful and its been something of an ambition of ours to have a holiday somewhere with a sea view so it was perfect you are doing a lovely job with the building and we would love to be able to visit again

8262304 patient safety is always our paramount concern and so we have immediately responded to the recommendation of the idmc we are currently notifying all participating clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies that enrollment of new patients into vital 2 has been suspended as has treatment with gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer of patients enrolled in the study
8262305 notwithstanding this disappointing outcome we would like to acknowledge the courage and commitment of the patients and physicians who have participated in this trial
8262306 the observation in the vital 2 trial is very surprising to us and we have therefore asked the idmc to conduct a previously unplanned futility analysis of vital 1 in order to determine the overall prospects for our ongoing development program for this product moreover with the cessation of vital 2 we expect to make commensurate adjustments to our business operations and we will provide further details regarding this in the near future as a reminder the company ended the second quarter of 2008 with 166 million in cash

8262314 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8262315 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain

8262333 es waren auch eine ganze menge leute da die einfach nur bock auf fu ballrandale hatte
8262334 mir war vorher schon klar dass es knallen w rde
8262335 dabei ist die awo ja nun wirklich nicht als rechtsradikale organisation bekannt

8262348 i do not doubt their dedication but we are all mortal and finite beings and fatigue will set in at some stage i am sure we all agree that singapore citizens deserve the best of their representatives with a full house and all hands on deck
8262349 to me the response of the grassroots leaders and the residents whom i had met is a great assurance they gave us a strong mandate at the last ge general election and they knew that we would honour and respect that mandate even after the demise of one mp
8262350 they are confident that their interest and welfare will be taken care of none have raised the issue of a by election
8262351 sir we are here today debating the nature of democracy in singapore democracy is about the people about how they have the power and the people have spoken they have spoken their voice rings loud and clear and they want a by election

8262402 the results of this first study on the topic suggest that same sex partners who legalized their relationships in vermont may have been more committed to each other or functioning better prior to obtaining a civil union or that civil union status itself is helping to preserve their relationships future research will help clarify whether various legal statuses actually increase the likelihood that lesbian and gay couples stay together

8262518 ich bin sehr froh das wir helfen k nnen mehr menschen mit behinderung eine bessere mobilit t zu erm glichen der bundesverband der contergangesch digten hat hier konstruktive anregungen gegeben die wir sehr schnell und lebensnah umsetzen konnten
8262519 es ist nur folgerichtig dass aus gr nden der gleichbehandlung auch andere schwerbehinderte menschen mit vergleichbaren einschr nkungen diesen nachteilsausgleich in anspruch nehmen k nnen damit leisten wir auch einen beitrag zur sozialen stadt zur teilhabe aller am gesellschaftlichen leben
8262520 zivis sind heute l ngst in der mitte der gesellschaft angekommen
8262521 ihre arbeit ist hoch anerkannt und aus vielen sozialen einrichtungen kaum mehr wegzudenken f r familien mit kranken oder pflegebed rftigen angeh rigen sind die zivildienstleistenden wertvolle helfer und eine wichtige st tze daf r erhalten die jungen m nner oft ganz individuell dank und wertsch tzung aber auch wir als staat wollen ihnen f r ihr wertvolles engagement im dienst der allgemeinheit so viel wie m glich anerkennung geben
8262522 weil auch arbeitgeber wissen dass der zivildienst den jungen m nnern wichtige berufliche grundqualifikationen wie teamgeist und verantwortungsbewusstsein mit auf den weg gibt werden wir den zivildienst bewusst als lerndienst gestalten damit st rken wir die pers nliche und soziale kompetenz der jungen m nner nachhaltig
8262523 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
8262524 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
8262525 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
8262526 theres a lot of collaboration and its all flexible learning can occur anytime anywhere and be self directed
8262527 people learn in different ways and at different rates we felt there needed to be options in education for them
8262528 we made charts of the best components of education that weve seen and designed our courses around that
8262529 i also did some home schooling so i have a broad understanding of how kids learn in different environments
8262530 this is not a new problem and although in theory flooding is good for the wetlands the content of the water remains a serious problem
8262531 this kind of pollution is extremely bad for the area and we had hoped the clean up would take no longer than a few weeks
8262532 the problem at bog meadows is going to keep occurring until the sewer system on the falls road is replaced
8262533 northern ireland water ni water has been made aware of sewage in the area surrounding bog meadows ni water is awaiting results of ongoing investigations
8262534 it is most distressing to watch residents having to dispose of furniture and personal belongings destroyed by the flood water
8262535 they are very angry that the problems with the river pipes have not been sorted out that is why the meeting with the rivers agency was organised
8262536 it could take at least six months to correct the damage and then the same thing could happen again
8262537 although everyone is stressed and worried we are adamant that something has to be done
8262538 the rivers agency has agreed to carry out a full internal inspection of the culvert at the location to ascertain if there is any obstruction to flow or structural defects to the culvert which may have contributed to the flooding
8262539 rivers agency staff will also examine whether this stretch of watercourse system is hydraulically adequate for both present and future flows from existing and planned development within the catchment
8262540 we were hit eight years ago by a bad flood and we were told then that the pipe had been sorted and it would not happen again
8262541 the residents are also considering legal action to ensure this level of damage can be avoided in the future

8262547 this is a response to a slower traffic period and were giving ourselves some operational flexibility in the winter months
8262548 the industry typically experiences an overall decline in traffic between january and early march our winter schedule is a reflection of that change
8262549 we tried to keep to the humane stories based in the broader political social and economic context of time
8262550 many of the men were nationalist supporters who were encouraged by john redmond and joe devlin to join up
8262551 as many others they went on a promise that they would return to home rule
8262552 like those encouraged by carson they believed that if they enlisted they would gain what they wanted politically
8262553 however when the war ended the nationalist party as they knew it had ceased to exist
8262554 they returned to a different world to the one they had left behind
8262555 we have been amazed at the amount of information we have received from the public
8262556 at present the publication is sitting with the publisher and we have tried to include as much information as possible but it is still coming in
8262557 we made a presentation to the lord mayors office as a thank you for the continued support and encouragement he has offered us
8262558 we see this project as a key part of belfasts history and are very keen to forge links with the council and lord mayor hartley
8262559 i am a great believer in the complexity of our past which needs looked at and discussed
8262560 we have a big history and this group is looking at this period in the political context of men on the falls road
8262561 we have been working on this now for the past two years and realise there is so much more we can do
8262562 we have received so much information that we are not closing the door on the possibility of research continuing in the future
8262563 the gathering of information like this is becoming more important than ever
8262564 as the years move on the first world war is becoming more and more of a distant memory so it is vitally important that this information is gathered and published in this way
8262565 we need to get the traffic wardens back into west belfast as soon as possible
8262566 from next week the schools will be starting back and traffic will naturally increase we cant afford to have motorists parking just anywhere
8262567 there have now been a number of meetings held on the issue and i would urge the psni to assess the case further and provide details of where the threat is coming from
8262568 the entire community must speak with one strong and civilised voice and assert that the only way for everyone to progress is outright condemnation of and challenge this insignificant speck of society whose only significance is their belief in inflicting pain and hurt on innocent workers
8262569 police in west belfast are continuing to liaise closely with all the relevant parties involved in this matter in an attempt to bring about a satisfactory and expedient conclusion
8262570 this is not a matter for police alone and cooperation is required from all those concerned officers take the security of individuals extremely seriously and are striving to make the community safer
8262571 this summer has been a lot more special for us as a family
8262572 we have taken nathan to many places that this time last year we would not have thought of doing due to the tremendous stress of travelling there and back
8262573 nathan has enjoyed trips to the zoo local parks and ballycastle and it has been great to see him enjoying himself
8262574 we would have been unable to do many of these things without the generous use of the car
8262575 nathan has showed tremendous spirit for someone so young and it is a testament to his familys love and determination to make nathans life as normal as possible while doctors and specialists try to find a diagnosis for his illness
8262576 if by offering the use of a car charles hurst toyota can help relieve the stresses and strains of everyday life then we are delighted to do so
8262577 requires people to temper the natural human instinct toward moralistic posturing
8262578 something needs to be done now not next year there needs to be a plan put in place now
8262579 its been a struggle we lost about 800 to 1 000 of stock but thats nothing compared to the carpet we didnt even get a year out of it we had to wait six months after the last flooding last june for the cement to dry out to get the carpet down and now we have to do the same again
8262580 its a nightmare we cant stand the cost of this it will run into thousands again its horrendous we had to pay 45 000 last time but we cant keep going at that kind of outlay
8262581 the insurance is a major problem there is a strong possibility we wont get insured this time round the insurance man said he could say last years flooding was a freak occurrence but he cant say that now so he told us it doesnt look good
8262582 there is too much talking and no action is being taken on the ground we need action you think when it is publicised on tv then people would be coming down here and getting it sorted but no one has come near us
8262583 we can even hold a meeting here if she wants
8262584 i dont care what party they are from sinn fein dup whatever we just need something done im very disappointed you would have thought someone would have shown a bit of interest this place was in a foot and a half deep of water we dont know exactly how much it will cost but the bar which was only put in last year after the last floods cost 18 000 and it will have to be replaced
8262585 we cant carry on like this there needs to be a plan on how to deal with it long term not just a reactionary plan
8262586 a number of homes and businesses premises were swamped as torrents of both river water and sewerage flowed throughout their premises
8262587 this is a deeply disappointing decision by michelle gildernew and i will be asking her to reconsider her decision or even to allow her officials to meet with the flood victims
8262588 due to the high number of requests for minister gildernew to visit sites in areas affected by the recent flooding the minister has been be unable to meet all requests
8262589 a feasibility study on the loop river system has recently been completed rivers agency is studying its content and recommendations in order to determine the best way forward
8262590 no activity concerning the airport took place at the park resulting in henrys death
8262591 one of the greatest characters of belfasts victoria park the much loved one legged goose called henry is no longer with us
8262592 i was walking my dogs in the park earlier this week and found henry lying quietly and obviously very sick i took him to the vet who confirmed that the injuries he sustained as the result of an attack by a dog had left him in a sorry state
8262593 despite attempts to help him he passed away in the night
8262594 he was only a goose but a character and sadly missed in the park
8262595 henry escaped the clutches of the airport only to meet his end it seems being mauled by a dog
8262596 hopefully although henry is gone the other geese will enjoy a brighter future in the park after all it was henrys picture that attracted sympathy and support and raised the plight of the death threat over the geese
8262597 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8262634 its been this long standing idea on campus this idea of mobility we looked at things like one to one laptop programs several years ago but for a number of reasons battery life the size of the device the expense we decided against it we looked at treos and other phones but none of the devices were quite there
8262635 with this announcement we recognized the fact that we needed to accelerate our plan to roll out wireless and re evaluate how we roll it out
8262636 over the summer we installed 330 additional access points focusing on the freshmen residence halls the library the campus center and all academic spaces
8262637 a professor can ask students who are the three most influential americans in history
8262638 as the names come in to the professor he can deploy them back out to the students the screen becomes a list of all the names students can type out the one they think is most influential and the names become larger or smaller based on the responses this creates a word cloud its a powerful tool that allows students in a classroom to brainstorm and get concepts out quickly it also allows them to ask questions without raising their hands
8262639 we created a little application that allows a professor to take a roll call
8262640 the application shows pictures of all the students and shows them present tardy absent and excused so the professor can learn names quicker
8262641 our faculty members are no longer able to disseminate information as a sole source
8262642 we recently signed a contract with alcatel lucent to explore what that means

8262666 obama ser buen presidente para los intereses de chile de hecho quiere conocer a michelle bachelet
8262667 si bien ambos tienen una posici n similar en cuanto a pol tica internacional la necesidad de revisar el tratados de libre comercio con chile por parte de obama lo transforman en un riesgo
8262668 la visi n de los dem cratas hacia latinoam rica y por cierto nuestro pa s es perjudicial y delicado adem s en su propia campa a lo ha dicho lo cual lo transforma en un proteccionista peligroso todo lo dem s tiene que ver con asuntos internos y yo no tomo partido en eso

8262752 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities for viper
8262753 as the company evaluates strategic options to maximize core operations and leverage its assets we have agreed to listen to these parties
8262754 and the iranian reaction would definitely make the enemy regret both its decision and action

8262775 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8262776 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8262777 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here

8262782 we were thinking about it how are we going to meet the expectation
8262783 we are doing our best to having a team available to compete against new zealand next week that is the biggest challenge for us especially against the all blacks who have gone from strength to strength
8262784 we were thinking around about three or four weeks ago exploring other options but it was a bit late on our behalf because the irb had already given their approval for sanctioning the game
8262785 there is nothing much we can do about it now people have purchased tickets so it would be hard for us to pull out of it
8262786 we do have some boys available back home most of them are involved in the sevens
8262787 we just have two areas of particular weakness we are having a game today in auckland to sort out that issue getting those positions sorted out
8262788 unfortunately the players have a say but the bottom line of the final say are the clubs
8262789 the organisation that runs the premier competition in england indicated that they should give their first priority to their club

8262801 celtic rugby is striving to align itself with other professional rugby tournaments
8262802 consequently this season will be the last that the magners league is played in its present format
8262803 from 2009 10 we will be introducing an end of season play off itll maintain interest in the league through to the end of the year
8262804 also we intend to address the irregular nature of the competition by creating a rhythmic season achievable as weekends will not compete with any other tournament

8262806 there have been tangible improvements in the standard of council services over the past 10 years yet consumer expectations also continue to rise
8262807 the new challenge for councils is to deliver better community engagement and a real increase in levels of customer satisfaction
8262808 councils need to put people at the heart of service delivery and take complaints seriously
8262809 where things go wrong people should be able to expect swift and fair redress getting this approach right should also help ensure that there is less need for redress going forward
8262810 councils have become highly attuned to the needs and wants of their inspectors but perhaps less so to the demands of their customers
8262811 now we have an opportunity to put the customer back at the heart of our business
8262812 even the best businesses sometimes give their customers problems it is the quality of solutions which truly define customer care this is not just about financial redress the value of a sincere apology and swift remedy is often overlooked
8262813 we put our customers at the very heart of everything we do and build our business around them
8262814 people have every right to expect good customer care in the wide range of services provided by their local authorities and we are happy to share our experience

8262841 het is nooit mijn bedoeling geweest om mensen te kwetsen
8262842 ik heb mij te veel laten gaan in de euforie van na ef supporterscommentaar was de overtreder blond geweest dan had ik misschien vuile witte geroepen
8262843 zoiets doet men niet ik had beter meer afstand genomen van het spelgebeuren het is nooit mijn intentie geweest mensen te kwetsen met racistische uitlatingen worden die dan in andere omstandigheden uit hun context gehaald begrijp ik de reactie
8262844 ik heb er dan ook geen probleem mee om mij te verontschuldigen bij al diegenen die zich door mijn uitlatingen gekwetst of aangesproken zouden voelen
8262845 dat was echt nooit mijn bedoeling en dat is zeker niet mijn overtuiging integendeel wie mij kent kent allicht mijn gaven maar ook mijn andere karaktertrekken zo zou ik inderdaad beter op mijn woorden moeten letten ook in emotionele of minder formele omstandigheden ik heb het hart op de tong en soms speelt me dat parten maar ja de volmaaktheid is ook aan mij jammer genoeg niet besteed ik zal dus in het vervolg beter op mijn woorden letten ook in het heetst van welke sportieve strijd ook
8262846 roelandt heeft me duidelijk gemaakt dat de woorden wel gezegd werden in een supporterssituatie maar dat deze absoluut niet racistisch bedoeld waren

8262848 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

8262852 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
8262853 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
8262854 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
8262855 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
8262856 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video
8262857 im still an amateur but i want to thank jype for giving me the chance to debut as a music video director and making my dreams come true
8262858 asked for security when reporters from his own newspaper ask to talk to him the chicago tribune writes

8262860 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8262861 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8262862 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8262863 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8262864 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8262865 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8262866 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part

8262868 der grund daf r ist in zwei aspekten zu suchen
8262869 wer sich auf eigene kosten impfen l sst muss mit kosten in h he von etwa 450 euro rechnen
8262870 die viren werden durch geschlechtsverkehr bertragen und haben eine inkubationszeit von zehn bis 15 jahren
8262871 der erste liegt bei etwa 30 jahren also entsprechend zehn bis 15 jahren nach dem ersten geschlechtsverkehr
8262872 der grund daf r kann sein dass die ehe gescheitert der partner gestorben ist oder die frau einfach in eine midlifecrises kommt
8262873 wir k nnen noch nicht sagen wie hoch die prozentuale heilungsquote ist sind uns aber sicher dass die impfung sinnvoll und n tzlich ist
8262874 wir glauben da wurde ein hoch riskanter test auf den markt gebracht der nicht ausreichend klinisch getestet wurde und der die gesundheit der bev lkerung gef hrden k nnte
8262875 leider gibt es bisher noch immer keinen zuverl ssigen test gegen eierstockkrebs
8262876 es w re sch n und wichtig dass wir endlich einen verl ssichen test haben aber das kann noch eine ganze weile dauern
8262877 wenn die frauen zum beispiel durch eine umfangszunahme am bauch selbst auf die idee kommen dass etwas nicht stimmen k nnte ist es oftmals schon zu sp t
8262878 i know i must have read large numbers of books that i dont even remember reading occasionally i find myself reading one and realise im actually rereading
8262879 what i like to think is that the better ones of the books i do at least remember reading have left some beneficial trace at a level somewhere just below the conscious retrievable memory an afterglow an aura a faint fragrance or maybe im deluding myself
8262880 i read a chapter of david copperfield a day to him explaining points of conduct geography history character ethics etc and it seems a means of awakening him to realities dickens read aloud shows how far afield we moderns have gone from duty to readers the reading mind is a12 year old mind just like the movie mind it requires a gentle introduction to its story characters slowly and definitely introduced with major physical descriptions since no movie was anticipated noises backgrounds voices all clarified since no radio version was planned if authors continued to pander to every sense as the old writers did instead of pandering to their own egos books would still be greater than radio or movies
8262881 it is not wise to look too hard at whats going on when we read and write for in both we are dithering around on the boundary between the demonstrable world and the inviolably private world of our minds
8262882 it was a mental error i played sloppy after the break
8262883 im going to bear down mentally from here on out
8262884 this will result in the exchange of information between ourselves and the officials in abu dhabi
8262885 we believe it is beneficial to have our officers embedded with law enforcement authorities there
8262886 we will do some training for some of their personnel

8262888 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8262889 we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility we need to re examine the nature depth and breadth of relations with russia
8262890 the chancellor renewed her call for the immediate enforcement of the six point ceasefire plan
8262891 there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8262892 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8262893 we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8262894 china which has its own separatists will be the biggest problem
8262895 the recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia is unacceptable for beijing
8262896 when you talk of steam people think you are going backwards
8262897 anywhere where you are wasting a lot of heat we can go in capture the heat and turn it into energy savings steam has tremendous power if it can drive a steam locomotive why cant it drive an automotive engine
8262898 there is a lot of heat that is created and totally wasted
8262899 recycling exhaust heat and energy that is rejected from the engine has got to be the way forward in the future
8262900 a tank of petrol or a tank of diesel is such an incredibly good energy store that we have been able to afford to throw some of it away up until now
8262901 any technology that can be gradually introduced like that is a very sensible idea so i think they are doing exactly the right thing
8262902 its a perfectly feasible idea certainly it adds complexity to the engine and therefore cost and i think thats why we havent seen it before
8262903 obviously now with rising oil prices etc it becomes essential to extract more energy from the fuel you are putting in
8262904 shut the fuck up i couldnt move you stupid fucknut

8262917 the prisoners escaped to save their life when the jail premises were under five to six feet of water
8262918 the election process is on in the state and we expected that there will be attempts to disrupt the process and infiltration is part of that bid but we are prepared as a nation to quell any problem that may arise
8262919 forces that are behind the disruption want to show that they exist we are taking all efforts to see that they do not get a upper hand and they will be neutralised
8262920 that is why we are aware and prepared it is unfortunate that this militant attack is happening i hope that it will discontinue in the near future
8262921 the amarnath controversy has happened at a wrong time unfortunately but it has nothing to do with it infiltration and terror attacks
8262922 i think we all know what is happening in the border it is important that we exercise restraint but be prepared thats what we are doing
8262923 who called me into politics it was you people what do you want it should be rule by the people for the people

8262925 incredible what a game no matter who wins this game they deserve it and you should tip your cap to both teams whether you are a mets fan or a phillies fan you should embrace this game that was played tonight
8262926 this was an instant classic with improbable heroes like coste and eric bruntlett in particular extraordinary gamesmanship including newest third baseman carlos ruiz and a bullpen that once again refused to break
8262927 despite the result this was without a doubt the most entertaining baseball game of the season and one of the best games i have seen in years
8262928 no way were winning this game here i just have to hope for a single or walk

8262934 maharashtras police force barring a few bhaiyya north india ips officers is marathi and is aware of the attempts to destroy marathi
8262935 was to raise funds for jehad and attract people for the cause

8262938 the bsf chief told the meeting that the district administration of the concerned border districts have imposed night curfew in most areas along the border as we do not want anyone to be killed in the frontiers
8262939 un popolo che paga il pizzo un popolo senza dignita
8262940 india is keen to sign an extradition treaty with bangladesh only but dhaka is not interested as the treaty should involve all members of the regional forum
8262941 since a multilateral agreement is already in place bangladesh is assessing whether there is any need for a bilateral one with india on exchange of criminals
8262942 india has so far handed over six bangladeshi criminals it means that they can nab the other thugs and hand them over to us
8262943 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president

8262945 the legislation will be introduced as planned these are just excuses
8262946 the enabling legislation does not dictate the timing or the structure of the proposals and the decision runs counter to the recommendations of the auditor general who they wanted to vet the process
8262947 the legislation will be introduced and they will be required to vote on it
8262948 at no stage did the premier call mr hickey or anyone else a liar
8262949 why my child do you ask why well i will tell you why you see the child lives instead of the wind he hears the sound of angels singing before my throne instead of the beauty that passes he sees everlasting beauty he sees my face he was created and lived a short time so the image of his parents imprinted on his face may stand before me as their personal intercessor he knows secrets of heaven unknown to men on earth he laughs with a special joy that only the innocent possess my ways are not the ways of man i create for my kingdom and each creature fills a place in that kingdom that could not be filled by another he was created for my joy and his parents merits he has never seen pain or sin he has never felt hunger or pain i breathed a soul into a seed made it grow and called it forth
8262950 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8262951 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8262952 the research does indicate that there is a relationship between advertising and childrens food and beverage preferences and requests
8262953 it also indicates a relationship between television viewing as distinct from television advertising specifically and obesity in children however existing research does not clearly demonstrate a causal relationship between any of these factors and obesity and indeed only a modest association is apparent
8262954 in spite of acmas claims there is little doubt that junk food commercials are contributing to the obesity epidemic by encouraging pester power
8262955 they were sitting up on the road and they were just screaming theres a two year old inside
8262956 she said that she had her there and was trying to get the other kids out as well and just somehow lost her in the panic with the other kids
8262957 she went back to get her out and could hear her inside but she just couldnt get in
8262958 every firefighter wants to save everyone its just so tragic
8262959 kids out there going to average schools deserve every opportunity that kids at flash schools have
8262960 like school reporting is already a feature of our system
8262961 i cannot understand why public institutions such as schools should not be accountable to the community that funds their salaries and their running costs
8262962 weve had fuelwatch weve had grocery watch and now weve got school watch
8262963 its obviously been a factor playing on the minds of oil markets at the moment
8262964 theres a potential impact on production in the gulf of mexico area

8262981 long term forecasts show gustav entering the gulf of mexico west of cuba on saturday or sunday
8262982 u s landfall projections are too early to guess at this point
8262983 anyone who lives along the gulf of mexico needs to keep up with the latest weather forecasts u s landfall projections will begin to take shape in another day or two
8262984 all interests in the caribbean the gulf of mexico and florida should closely monitor gustav as it moves through the caribbean
8262985 mr patel has pled innocent and is presumed innocent under the law
8262986 he is looking forward to having his day in court
8262987 as it gets closer to the gulf we will see activity as to moving personnel and securing facilities
8262988 this storm could change direction and it could change in intensity
8262989 theres a chance it could veer off in a different direction
8262990 the elements are there for this to be a major storm
8262991 the ones that cant be shut down remotely have to be closed before you leave
8262992 then you just wait and see you cant move platforms
8262993 right now theyre just waiting its too early to make a decision theyll probably start moving non essential personnel off the rigs pretty soon
8262994 theyre not panicking the storm wont get into the gulf until probably saturday
8262995 even as the state is better prepared it is important for families to be personally responsible
8262996 they should not wait until the storm has entered the gulf before they go to store to buy batteries and necessary supplies
8262997 the work by the administration to take control of the suspects lessened the chance of anyone being seriously injured
8262998 re create 68 is it unreasonable for the police to prevent a group dedicated to re creating the

8263000 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years
8263001 the whole purpose is to increase efficiency and reduce wait time
8263002 what doctors offices are starting to see is that front end administrative work can easily be automated just the way banks and airlines are
8263003 but often more technology can separate us from patients it hasnt happened that way
8263004 but sometimes our elderly population isnt ready for that type of technology instead they need an actual person to tell them how do i get from appointment to appointment
8263005 we know what to do we can do things on the state level we just lack the political will
8263006 we have examples in other states where they have done public private partnerships to reduce premiums by 30 percent
8263007 we think there is going to be a lot more to come
8263008 we cant keep up with the people at 300 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level who are now seeking care in emergency rooms

8263013 jobs offered to me dont pay enough im not going to work if i cant afford a place to live and to be able to eat
8263014 myrtle beach is an expensive place to live youre on the beach its a vacation area not a place for people with low income
8263015 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8263016 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8263017 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8263018 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8263019 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8263020 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8263021 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part

8263030 she asked clinton was the featured speaker of the second night of the convention and she followed a series of other democrats to the podium who had ripped into republican mccain as indifferent to the working class and cozy with big oil if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8263031 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8263032 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8263033 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans

8263048 newman repeatedly made it clear that he wanted to be buried next to his lifelong partner no one gave the pope permission to defy newmans wishes the reburial has only one aim in mind to cover up newmans homosexuality and to disavow his love for another man it is an act of shameless dishonesty and personal betrayal by the gay hating catholic church
8263049 it is conceivable that both men had a gay orientation but chose to abstain from sex abstinence does not alter orientation
8263050 we go to liberate not to conquer we will not fly our flags in their country we are entering iraq to free a people and the only flag which will be flown in that ancient land is their own show respect for them if you are ferocious in battle remember to be magnanimous in victory there are some who are alive at this moment who will not be alive shortly those who do not wish to go on that journey we will not send as for the others i expect you to rock their world wipe them out if that is what they choose but if you are ferocious in battle remember to be magnanimous in victory iraq is steeped in history it is the site of the garden of eden of the great flood and the birthplace of abraham tread lightly there you will see things that no man could pay to see and you will have to go a long way to find a more decent generous and upright people than the iraqis you will be embarrassed by their hospitality even though they have nothing dont treat them as refugees for they are in their own country their children will be poor in years to come they will know that the light of liberation in their lives was brought by you if there are casualties of war then remember that when they woke up and got dressed in the morning they did not plan to die this day allow them dignity in death bury them properly and mark their graves it is my foremost intention to bring every single one of you out alive but there may be people among us who will not see the end of this campaign the enemy should be in no doubt that we are his nemesis and that we are bringing about his rightful destruction there are many regional commanders who have stains on their souls and they are stoking the fires of hell for saddam there may be people among us who will not see the end of this we will put them in their sleeping bags and send them back there will be no time for sorrow he and his forces will be destroyed by this coalition for what they have done as they die they will know their deeds have brought them to this place show them no pity it is a big step to take another human life it is not to be done lightly i know of men who have taken life needlessly in other conflicts i can assure you they live with the mark of cain upon them if someone surrenders to you then remember they have that right in international law and ensure that one day they go home to their family the ones who wish to fight well we aim to please

8263058 weve been blessed with a lot of volunteer work to make it happen
8263059 its going to happen but the problem is we have huge balances to pay off
8263060 its about doing it right and doing it once balanced by raising the money
8263061 the end goal is to build sustainable alternative energy homes onsite but that will take two or three years to raise the money for
8263062 if this place fails as a small organic farm its not a good sign for the world
8263063 if they put michael towbes under the scrutiny were under nothing would ever get done in goleta
8263064 making clothes together in our studio makes us feel complete we probably sound like a group of grannies in a knitting circle but its the truth and it gives us some control over our visual identity when you are a big band and everyone is taking shots at you the more things you can do together the better
8263065 i believe one of the unintended consequences of forbidding such words to be spoken is imbuing those words with more power than they should ever have and helping create the illusion that the bigotry and racism expressed by such cruel epithets is less prevalent than it actually is which we all know is sadly not the case
8263066 ive been up and down the road in discussions with my ex wife dina and its to the point now that im going to confront samantha and jenny muro lindsays production assistant myself

8263081 der landkreis cham ist eine der erfolgreichsten und dynamischsten regionen bayerns der letzten jahre diese positive wirtschaftsentwicklung war nicht zuletzt durch den jahrzehntelangen einsatz der staatsregierung f r den ausbau der ostbayerischen verkehrsinfrastruktur m glich
8263082 die infrastrukturentwicklung muss mit der verkehrsentwicklung mithalten wir m ssen weiter an der beseitigung von engp ssen arbeiten
8263083 wir wollen dass die schiene eine vollwertige alternative zum stra enverkehr ist daher m ssen wir auch in der fl che ein hochwertiges verkehrsangebot aufrechterhalten
8263084 hier ist der freistaat nach der einstellung von interregio und eurocity f r den bund in die bresche gesprungen und hat durch die bestellung von regionalz gen den fernverkehrsstandard auf einer internationalen verkehrsachse wiederhergestellt
8263085 zum anderen arbeiten wir kontinuierlich am ausbau der b 20 zentrales projekt ist dabei der bau der ortsumgehung der stadt furth i wald mit investitionen von 50 millionen euro
8263086 neben dem izb stehen uns heuer auch erstmals gelder aus dem programm zukunft bayern 2020 f r den staatsstra enbau zur verf gung f r den landkreis cham hei t das beispielsweise dass die finanzierung der ortsumgehung sch nthal an der st 2400 sichergestellt ist und noch in diesem jahr begonnen werden kann
8263087 dieses geld flie t in ganz besonderem umfang in den l ndlichen raum
8263088 wir werden uns auf umweltfreundliche technologie und auf barrierefreie fahrzeuge konzentrieren
8263089 trotz aller ma nahmen im ffentlichen verkehr wird die stra e im l ndlichen raum der verkehrstr ger nr 1 bleiben es muss einen ausgleich f r die gestiegenen benzin und dieselkosten geben damit die mobilit t f r personen und g ter bezahlbar bleibt
8263090 ich stimme dem motto der gr nen zu schluss mit den atoml gen allerdings richtet sich diese aufforderung allein an die gr nen selbst ein neubau von kernkraftwerken steht f r die staatsregierung nicht zur debatte gegenteilige behauptungen sind bewusste fehlinterpretationen und falsche wahlkampfparolen wir setzen auf einen intelligenten energiemix mehr energieeffizienz und den ausbau erneuerbarer energien
8263091 sie erzeugen ber 60 unseres stroms und sind vorerst f r eine sichere bezahlbare und klimaschonende stromversorgung weiter erforderlich tatsache ist dass bayern gerade auch wegen des hohen anteils der co2 freien kernkraft an der stromerzeugung bei den co2 emissionen pro kopf weit unter dem bundesdurchschnitt liegt das sollten die gr nen die den klimaschutz immer propagieren endlich erkennen
8263092 das gegenteil ist der fall wir brauchen die kernkraft als br cke hin zu einer nachhaltigen klimafreundlichen energieversorgung mit erneuerbaren energien wir wollen dass die mit einer laufzeitverl ngerung verbundenen zus tzlichen gewinne zu einem erheblichen teil f r energietechnische forschung und entwicklung den ausbau erneuerbarer energien und die entlastung der stromverbraucher durch g nstige energiepreise eingesetzt werden
8263093 mit allen anstrengungen zum ausbau der erneuerbaren energien und zur stromeinsparung w re jedoch die bei einem kernausstieg bis 2019 entstehende stroml cke nicht zu schlie en die staatsregierung h lt deshalb eine laufzeitverl ngerung der bayerischen kernkraftwerke f r unerl sslich

8263095 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
8263096 i would say that as long as senator bidens stated position on abortion remains the same then it would apply to senator biden whether he was a senator or the vice president of any type of public figure
8263097 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
8263098 this is yet another example of a seemingly trusted organisation appearing to be sloppy with peoples personal information people are entitled to wonder why they are constantly being told about the importance of protecting personal information when large organisations dont seem to follow the same rules themselves
8263099 its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8263100 suppose for example youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom would you vote
8263101 het is nooit mijn bedoeling geweest om mensen te kwetsen
8263102 ik heb mij te veel laten gaan in de euforie van na ef supporterscommentaar was de overtreder blond geweest dan had ik misschien vuile witte geroepen
8263103 zoiets doet men niet ik had beter meer afstand genomen van het spelgebeuren het is nooit mijn intentie geweest mensen te kwetsen met racistische uitlatingen worden die dan in andere omstandigheden uit hun context gehaald begrijp ik de reactie
8263104 ik heb er dan ook geen probleem mee om mij te verontschuldigen bij al diegenen die zich door mijn uitlatingen gekwetst of aangesproken zouden voelen
8263105 dat was echt nooit mijn bedoeling en dat is zeker niet mijn overtuiging integendeel wie mij kent kent allicht mijn gaven maar ook mijn andere karaktertrekken zo zou ik inderdaad beter op mijn woorden moeten letten ook in emotionele of minder formele omstandigheden ik heb het hart op de tong en soms speelt me dat parten maar ja de volmaaktheid is ook aan mij jammer genoeg niet besteed ik zal dus in het vervolg beter op mijn woorden letten ook in het heetst van welke sportieve strijd ook
8263106 roelandt heeft me duidelijk gemaakt dat de woorden wel gezegd werden in een supporterssituatie maar dat deze absoluut niet racistisch bedoeld waren
8263107 om gemeenschapswachten toe te laten dergelijke situaties het hoofd te bieden zullen in de opleiding tevens vakken als psychologische benadering van conflicten en lichamelijke verdedigingstechnieken opgenomen worden

8263147 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships
8263148 in fact i see 2009 as a turning point in indias b to b publishing industry

8263182 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8263183 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor

8263216 thats not just cancer related to melanoma or other skin cancers
8263217 for prostate cancer the trend was in the direction of increased risk but the association was weaker and not statistically significant
8263218 people who have suboptimal ability to repair dna damage that the sun can cause are far more likely to get nonmelanoma skin cancer we are hypothesizing that that might also be the link to why there is a greater increased cancer risk in general
8263219 it is not unreasonable to suppose that patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers especially if diagnosed when the patient is young puts that person in a higher risk category of systemic cancers
8263220 in addition these patients are followed closely for further skin cancers and therefore may have an increased diagnosis of other cancers because they are plugged into the medical system
8263221 our skin cancer patients should know that they may be at increased for a wide variety of cancers like breast lung and colon and should not ignore early signs and symptoms if they occur
8263222 people who have had skin cancers should make sure they are up to date on all their screening tests
8263223 they should be up to date on their colonoscopies fecal occult blood and mammograms and pap smears
8263224 they the fda were concentrating on the more severe forms of the condition but we felt it was important to get this information out there
8263225 while a definite causal relationship between byetta and pancreatitis has not been proved to better understand the suspected relationship amylin and lilly continue to pursue a comprehensive drug safety program that includes extensive internal and external review of individual cases and clinical and epidemiologic studies
8263226 given the overall findings of this meta analysis it seems appropriate that the guidelines recommending tight glucose control in all critically ill patients should be re evaluated until the results of larger more definitive clinical trials are available
8263227 possible explanations for the discordant results of the study by van den berghe et al and the meta analysis by wiener et al are that the meta analysis is flawed the studies that form the basis of the meta analysis are flawed or inherently different or the findings of the study by van den berghe et al occurred due to random chance or as a result of another unique factor interacting with tight glycemic control
8263228 those investigating tight glycemic control should take a step back and address the fundamental questions of defining quality standards for tight glycemic control finding affordable methods of frequent and highly accurate measurement of blood glucose in the icu and conduct multicenter efficacy studies to determine if tighter glycemic control can reduce mortality under optimal conditions if tighter glycemic control can be proven effective in optimal conditions determining how to make that benefit available to millions of critically ill patients in both developed and resource poor countries around the world would be a truly worthwhile challenge there is no simple or clear answer to the complex problem of glycemic control in critically ill adults at present targeting tight glycemic control cannot be said to be either right or wrong
8263229 there is no reason to believe we will not have a strong 2009

8263231 people arent borrowing money to buy cars at the moment

8263233 you can put off buying a car but you cant put off repairing it if something goes wrong
8263234 the more turbulent macroeconomic environment has resulted in challenging trading conditions across the uk new and used car markets particularly in may and june and this has impacted the performance of our new and used car businesses

8263279 role overload too much to do and not enough time to do it provides another measure of wellbeing
8263280 for example often feeling that not enough is accomplished in the day worrying about not spending enough time with family constantly feeling under stress trying to accomplish more than can be handled and cutting back on sleep are all indicators of role overload
8263281 for example just over half of all day workers cut back on sleep compared with 70 per cent of evening shift workers and 63 per cent of rotating shift workers

8263336 were finally going to get this thing out on shelves there have been people asking about the delays so heres the full story we finished up recording and mixing this album back in july 2007 then we started shopping it to labels in the middle of this our guitarist left who we replaced with jim before getting picked up by anticulture in late 2007 early 2008 and they set a may release date during this time the artwork that we had for the cd was bought by sony bmg rendering it useless to us so we had to get the artwork re done by marcelo hvc this delay gave us the chance to remaster the album at the labels request and remove some samples that we were struggling to get clearance for but lo and behold when we went back the studio had deleted the audio luckily andy giblin had the rhythm guitars and drums saved in his personal archive so we re recorded the bass vocals and solos in june of this year remixed the album and remastered it it sounds a whole lot better but its been 18 months in the making so we hope you fucking enjoy it
8263337 metal manifesto this album is really the simplest most direct injection of metal ive ever had the illicit pleasure to produce it is worth the weight trust me its either our crowning glory or my scorched swan song no click track no kbds no autotune no gratuitous octupled guitars or vocals no cutting out all the mistakes ok i admit we did tune the guitars but that was after much gunplay its as warts n all and as in yer face as i could get it and it phreakin rocks me all that i can ask of an album is that the songs and musicians are strong that the sound is unique and most importantly that it sounds to me what my favorite album would sound like as far as reference to past pile issue musically i would think that this album sounds like it belongs smack between inquisition and ugly but done with todays gear a few of the songs battle axe and road pigs were even written back in 86 and 87 more importantly it sounds as totally different and fresh as it sounds familiarly old school and pile icious after its release on halloween the fans will no doubt let us know loud and clear what this album is and where it fits then well all know hyaaar the bottom line is im quite pleased with it it rocks my face off so the fans should like it too after all as the exalted high priest of the metal inquisition could i really do other than bang my head thrash it out and speak the words that thou wouldst not of course not that wouldnt be living to the word of my metal manifesto

8263518 she so effectively dramatizes the pain inflicted by such language something many people of non minority descent never have to face

8263530 the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers
8263531 if you want to do it on a national scale where the transmission line distances will be much longer and utility regulations are different congress must act
8263532 modernizing the electric infrastructure is an urgent national problem and one we all share
8263533 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
8263534 there was a special situation in kosovo there is a special situation in south ossetia and abkhazia
8263535 speaking about our situation it is obvious that our decision is aimed at preventing the genocide the elimination of a people and helping them get on their feet
8263536 they turned it into a place where international terrorists were feeling at home
8263537 depending on where you sat you could easily call those places breakaway republics
8263538 what makes the situations murky is each superpower tries to exploit ad hoc situations as they emerge to advance its interests and to hurt its rivals its really the way the superpowers manipulate the reality its not the reality that is complicated
8263539 this is in violation of the principle of territorial integrity which is one of the basic principles of international law and this is therefore absolutely unacceptable and i think the whole of the european union will come forward in stating this very clearly
8263540 this was the only hope of people who live on the other side of the pass to return to a normal way of life
8263541 susan collins is politically adept but we all know shes a secret bush clone

8263590 when your dealing with outside branches or los and a big company has a larger target on their back than most a company can do a great job with compliance and still get into a mess of one kind or another
8263591 guess 80 percent of their los are non performers during this downturn large companies with commission only loan officers will have to downsize or bought out during this tough period

8263596 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8263597 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8263598 one of the most groundbreaking candidates ever to run for the presidency
8263599 senator clinton has inspired millions of women and men with her unyielding commitment to the causes that we all care so deeply about
8263600 and tonight she left no doubt about what we all must do to face the challenges ahead of us unite behind barack obama and present a fully unified democratic party to the country and the world

8263609 no n canonical use of western scriptures by non european religious
8263610 as an african american and a lesbian i havent been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking
8263611 we believe that the actions of the contract security guard were inappropriate and unacceptable we have notified his company paragon of our position in the matter

8263613 how to best start incorporating the new rules of the social web into a digital pr effort
8263614 what do you mean your sisters dating somebody who works for warner brothers
8263615 im interesse des turners und seiner entwicklung ist die ffentliche auseinandersetzung zu beenden
8263616 ive had occasions in my past where i knew another coach was doing something wrong and i communicated with that coach
8263617 so i would never throw somebody under the bus like that
8263618 i thought i was so off the wall that i thought it was tongue in cheek and even went back to make sure that those around knew i was joking
8263619 i cant count the number of times the good lord has forgiven me i took it for what it is thats just vic being sarcastic like vic always is
8263620 heres a school clemson thats had zero bad blood and has recruited that state actively
8263621 thats why i was kind of surprised it snowballed and got the momentum it did we didnt even recruit him julio jones so that shows you how insignificant the statement is
8263622 the multiples of this team are probably as great as anybody we play
8263623 i thought that the last two days were very encouraging with deanthony
8263624 what else can i say on offense he hasnt performed up to his abilities weve got a lot of players at that position and weve even got a true freshman on second team thats played awfully well and will be a heck of a football player even our older players can find out very quickly how important it is to be consistent you cant rest on experience you cant rest on hey ive been here you better play and you better perform
8263625 its much harder to prepare for a team where the coach was thrown out of there because they werent very good and then they change everything up were playing as if theres no changes in their offense defense and special teams
8263626 for a lot of guys this is going to be their first real experience of playing a lot or starting in a game
8263627 its on the road its going to be real noisy its always interesting to see if what happens in practice carries over to games practices and scrimmages are different
8263628 i told the guys that we had all the injuries we could have for the year nobody else can get hurt were done with that stuff
8263629 if our players want to high five the fans and give em a fist bump or something like that were going to do it
8263630 seems like every school in the nations doing that now and weve not done it were going to start doing that i think our players need to know the importance of playing football for the university of south carolina and our fans are the ones that have demonstrated how important it is
8263631 we looked at usc when chow was with the titans and we had to find a san diego state film for the quarterback craft to see his tendencies and stuff like that
8263632 were all even with the the teams in our league
8263633 our first year goal was to be competitive into the third quarter now our goal is to win
8263634 im hearing people say were going to win this year
8263635 instead of past years when no one thought we were going to win very much i think were going to be competitive
8263636 i came over met the coaches and kind of fell in love with what we were doing
8263637 especially for me being a defensive guy shaw seemed like a great defensive mind
8263638 it doesnt require a lot of practice time or explaining
8263639 we can work on fundamentals every single day we dont have to worry so much about what the opposing offense is going to give us because we dont have many adjustments to make
8263640 ive never seen us play with as much intensity as we did in the camp
8263641 some of us didnt have the plays down last year
8263642 this year were getting it down working on double counts its a confidence boost now that we know we can compete with these opposing teams
8263643 we used to have a semi complicated offense and now we have a simple one
8263644 its really helped out the fluid motion a lot im so much more confident now
8263645 part of that is experience but also drilling since camp just in one year weve come so far
8263646 most of the opposing linemen are still bigger than me but now ive got the smarts to handle them
8263647 for offense weve started to split up between three rotations
8263648 even on defense weve split it up its enabled us to have more specialized groups instead of being more general
8263649 andy is a good player but we need to be careful with the balance we know what he can do and we do have many options with other players who can come in
8263650 we are good enough to compete with wicklow and if we work hard well get a result against them
8263651 what we didnt have last year was belief but we certainly have that this year
8263652 weve gained and lost a lot of players but some of the new players are even more influential and eager to get to croke park than some of the ones that were there last year they know its such a special place
8263653 wicklow have had friendlies against dublin meath and laois ahead of their semi final while we got londons under 16 boys
8263654 its hard for us to work on a level playing field
8263655 they are a very strong team theyve scored 13 goals in their last three games and are the current leinster champions beating louth in the final
8263656 the bookies have us down as underdogs and we are the expectation is all on wicklow
8263657 something that you only realise when you get there and you see what its all about
8263658 you can see what has happened with the waterford hurlers davy fitzgerald came in from the outside and theyve broken through that barrier of getting to the all ireland final in the space of a couple of months they looked like they were down and out so there is the uplifting factor of a new broom and an outsider coming in
8263659 jason used to train five nights a week and then hed play two or three games every weekend there was no let up with him and im talking about nine years of constant training
8263660 in london it can be hard to keep motivated but rather than results pushing jason on i think it was his love of gaelic games and i think that will come through no matter what you cant falsify that and the wexford players will see that as well
8263661 i had a great time over here and i probably would have stayed were it not for my family over in ireland
8263662 there were only two games i ever won with london against kilkenny and against limerick down in abbeyfield but the feeling of beating limerick was amazing it was almost like winning an all ireland it meant an awful lot to us
8263663 he rang me and told me that wexford had offered him the managers job
8263664 i asked him if it was a bit soon but he replied i might never get another chance
8263665 he always had an interest in coaching even at school he would take on the school teams when he went back to ireland he got a chance and took it leading them to a county title was a massive achievement
8263666 hes experienced a lot of managers and coaching regimes rather than coaching himself but hes an intelligent guy strong willed and is a real positive influence in the dressing room
8263667 what jasons done very well is that hes played to the strengths of his players
8263668 cork city fans must be cursing me thinking reading are out to sign their players but its just a coincidence we have a good network in ireland and watch many clubs the fact that we have signed so many cork players is just by chance
8263669 ive been signed to bring goals to the side and thats what i intend to do of course i realise i have to deal with having a higher profile now and adapting to a better quality of football but i feel fresh and raring to go and feel confident i can deliver
8263670 of course these things are all about money and so yes the fee will help cork when they need it but as far as i am concerned i was sold to reading because its what i and the two clubs wanted
8263671 hes a big strong lad and he gives us some brawn which will be very useful this season i feel also hes impatient as am i he wants to get involved from the get go and score goals for us thats the kind of player i want here
8263672 i knew that playing for cork kind of put me in the spotlight history has shown that a lot of players leave cork for big sides so while obviously i wanted to win stuff there i was aware playing at turners cross provided a great chance to move on to a bigger club also
8263673 these five lads have put ireland back on the boxing map
8263674 now we are fifth in the world behind china russia france and britain and the reason were there is because of a high performance unit we set up eight years ago
8263675 we did fantastic in barcelona olympics 1992 when michael carruth and wayne mccullough won gold and silver medals but we didnt really push on from there
8263676 every other country got professional people in and we realised we had to do the same
8263677 it was a new idea and people were sceptical because paying coaches had never been done before
8263678 we got in professional people like gary keegan high performance director and hired coaches like billy walsh and zaur antia a decorated boxing champion from georgia
8263679 the association had never paid people before this but they saw they had to change
8263680 when the programme started it would have been very much results driven there was pressure there but for us more success meant more money
8263681 we identified lads aged 12 13 and 14 and our plan was to develop them in line with the high performance unit
8263682 one of the most important things we did then was to develop a four nations tournament among the home nations
8263683 this meant that our young boxers could gain international experience from the age of 12 years up
8263684 a lot of people gave out about our performance in the world championships in chicago last october then ireland only qualified one boxer paddy barnes in what was the first qualifying event and maybe they had good reason
8263685 they thought by this stage the high performance unit should have been delivering
8263686 but the qualifying process was always over three legs for us and that was only the first leg
8263687 in the end we qualified five boxers and that was a massive achievement in itself
8263688 originally when we set our target for the amount of boxers we planned to qualify for beijing people laughed
8263689 but look anyone who beats our boxers out here went on to win a gold medal so that shows you the quality
8263690 were good enough to qualify 11 boxers for london in 2012 and ive always said that thats the way we have to think
8263691 there are 11 weight divisions and that is what we will be aiming for
8263692 but we have to put even more money into the grass roots and back into the clubs
8263693 there is huge talent in the clubs and we cant take our eye off the ball for one minute because if we do well be gone again
8263694 i hope some of our boxers saying they would like to turn professional was a spur of the moment thing
8263695 another four years is only down the road and i think they should stay within the programme maybe when they get back home they will just want to settle back into their old routine and stay with the programme
8263696 yeah the lads have commented on the fact that theyve done well against ulster teams and they have no fears whatsoever of tyrone
8263697 our performance against down was a big step up from the leinster final and our display against armagh was an improvement again on what we produced to beat down
8263698 there is another even bigger performance in these lads and they are keen to deliver on that potential against tyrone well be working hard before the semi final to make sure well actually produce that sort of game
8263699 hes probably fit enough now but its a question of being match fit you cant get match fit unless you get games at this level and its not easy to get games at this level if the people that are in there are performing well
8263700 so its a bit of a catch 22 situation hes been very unfortunate because he was flying the time he got the injury against laois he missed a lot of training at that time the injury held him back for a long time
8263701 now hes back champing at the bit and its a great thing to have a player of his quality and calibre itching to get on that field

8263726 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8263727 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8263728 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8263729 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8263730 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8263731 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8263732 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything

8263774 but that id be a fool to let him go because we were perfect for each other and right before the final battle began when ron made a comment about saving the house elves i remembered what fred had told me and his words gave me the courage to kiss ron so yes fred was funny mischievous and often drove me barmy but he was also a caring and insightful person someone im proud to have known
8263775 bloody hell hermione you drive me completely mad just tell me whats wrong

8263802 i write to you to register my deep concern for the environmental and social problems associated with the albany project and would urge you to remove your support from this forthwith as the development is ecologically environmentally and socially irresponsible
8263803 it is clear to everyone that water is a very scarce resource on this island the fact that the albany development will site its golf course on top of the island s largest water lens is indefensible lined or not the golf course will impact the islands largest remaining water resource golf courses require fertilizers herbicides and fungicides to keep them green and healthy despite the most stringent protocols during heavy rains run off from the golf course will pollute the freshwater lens
8263804 the albany development s environmental impact statement says that total water use during peak period for the development will exceed 1
8263805 new providence island nassau is home to at least 215 000 people who use approximately 55 60 gals water per day compared to the 1000 persons who will be living at albany using close to 1000 gallons per person per day coupled with the astronomical water demands that albany will make on the system clearly it is a disaster in the making

8263811 we want to be vested in our clients success and failures charging a management fee for non performance doesnt seem a win win situation a manager should not be compensated for not producing an absolute return and by that i mean a positive return no matter what the market environment holds martin asset management charges a 10 performance fee with a high water mark for its separate managed accounts with no annual management fee some critics argue that such a setup will ultimately lead to greater risk taking in order to produce positive numbers i would argue that a performance fee with the high water mark will ensure that the contrary will happen when a manager gets compensated for actual positive returns he or she will treat the clients assets as if they were trading their own accounts and that is a fact
8263812 static non performance oriented fees dont fit the mold any longer investors are more than happy to pay for absolute returns a manager must be vested in the clients return prospective in order to create a portfolio that can perform in bull and bear markets we merge the best of hedge funds and separately managed accounts into one product that ultimately will serve the client with better returns

8263820 oh well um no honey you have to fertilize the egg each time you know and you dont always get pregnant every time you have sex either so you need to have sex at least once to make each baby
8263821 yes honey people do that well a lot sometimes people do it when theyre not even trying to make a baby
8263822 well because its fun because its a way that grown up people who love each other a lot share something special
8263823 you are supposed to think its gross all kids are its a grown up thing and youre not supposed to understand it all right now okay
8263824 in todays media environment it is vital that businesses communicate online and companies that choose to ignore this are running a major risk traditional pr tactics are not going to go away anytime soon but it is essential for companies to integrate online pr and social media into their existing offline communications strategies
8263825 despite finding that an increasing number of uk pr professionals are on the ball when it comes to online pr this survey confirms our experience that a high proportion are still more focused on traditional media however given that this is most probably a reflection of client budget and resource allocations perhaps what we should be asking ourselves is what this says about uk business attitude towards online communications

8263932 david wondered why an innocent baby should be killed but he was relieved that he personally would not have to feel any pain so god personally put a horrible plague on the newly born little baby and it struggled and suffered in great pain
8263933 it is impossible to adequately describe all the emotions and the magnitude of the human suffering that this dreadful war has wrought but we can at least begin to comprehend the enormity of it by looking briefly at some stories of those young men and women who paid with thier lives for bushs monumental crime
8263934 if george bush as i believe took this nation to war in iraq on a lie causing catastrophic repercussions on a scale far larger than the attacks of 9 11 what should we as a nation do about it
8263935 we do know that the iraqi regime has chemical and biological weopons
8263936 the gravity of this moment is matched by the gravity of the threat that iraqs weapons of mass destruction pose to the world there can be no doubt that saddam hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more many more
8263937 we do know that saddam is actively pursuing a nuclear weapon we dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud
8263938 saddam hussein continues to develop weapons of mass destruction the first time we may be completely certain has has nuclear weapons is when god forbid he uses one iraq presents a grave and gathering danger
8263939 iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical and biological weapons across broad areas
8263940 this could allow the iraqi regime to attack america without leaving any fingerprints
8263941 heres shakespeare lets go through him picking out examples of patriarchal oppression
8263942 i can honestly say andy reid is among the most boring conference calls that i can recall in the 20 some odd years ive been doing this

8263945 it was an american proposal that its troops to stay in iraq to2015 while the iraqi one suggested 2010 then we agreed on the date 2011
8263946 there is an agreement between the two sides that there would be no foreign soldiers in the iraqi by the end of 2011
8263947 it is obvious that bkirki interferes in details of the political life whether this is its right or not is another issue
8263948 hes exactly what we thought he would be when we drafted him
8263949 hes a powerful man inside he can control the double team hes getting better with his pass rush hes getting a better feel
8263950 we will have to wait and see with a veteran guy you might do that but with a young guy im not sure thats fair to him or the team well see what kind of progress he makes when we start next week
8263951 hes fearless he reminds me of ronde barber tampa bay in the way hes not afraid to tackle somebody hes learning and importantly hes learning from his mistakes thats what you are looking for as a coach i think he can be special in that nickel back role where he covers the guy in the slot
8263952 oh yes it makes a difference when hes out there
8263953 hes one of these young guys thats going to be on the field
8263954 hes learning and again what we are seeing from him is that hes not re learning the same lessons all the time
8263955 thats a tough one for him but hes got to come back and show us the same things he did before the injury
8263956 if he does that hell be ready hes already rehabbing so hopefully it wont be too long until hes back
8263957 he made a big play down in miami with that interception in the end zone he was in man to man coverage with his back to the quarterback and he turns and makes the catch not just knocking it away thats big thats really big for him that should help his confidence a lot
8263958 he did a good job in pass protection he has really improved
8263959 the united states is now winning the war that two years ago had seemed lost people are expressing a new confidence in their security forces parks are filled every weekend with families playing

8263962 there was only so much that you could take until we in fact had to leave the room for a while
8263963 it has embraced the ballot box it has created a fair and popular constitution it has avoided civil war iraqs violence has largely become local and criminal the violence while tragic has ceased being political and is therefore no longer nearly as important as it was
8263964 a persons past vote tells you something about his or her judgment obama talked a lot about the clarity of his judgment in opposing the iraq war
8263965 when he voted against the surge in january 2007 he claimed on more than one occasion that it would lead to increased casualties and sectarian violence it didnt howd he get that one wrong
8263966 in january 2007 obama claimed that the iraqi government would make no hard choices if the united states stayed
8263967 if obama was wrong about the tactical gains that would be made by the new strategy and wrong about how the iraqi political leaders will react can his larger theory about how iraqis will respond to a troop pullout remain intact
8263968 the violence in anbar has gone down despite the surge not because of the surge
8263969 the reality is that neither barack obama nor nuri al maliki nor most anybody else believes that the iraq war can be lost at this point

8263998 weve had it 10 12 years now thats when it started getting big in the league
8263999 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8264000 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8264001 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8264002 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8264003 i love the game and im glad weve got him because i wouldnt want him on any other team i know hes going to give us a great opportunity to win games hes a special athlete and a great athlete
8264004 i cant rush back if i rush it that might be my whole season dealing with the hamstring injury week in and week out i dont want that
8264005 its getting better every day so i think if it continues to progress like it is now i should be ready for the first game
8264006 its not good that it happened but luckily it happened in the preseason where i have an opportunity to rehab and get strong and not feel like i have to play on a bum leg
8264007 the inside receiver is against a lot of safeties and the linebackers who come down here and try to guard you to me that is a mismatch im a lot faster just get the ball in my hands and i can make things happen i know theyre going to try to get in my face and jam me on the line of scrimmage ive been working real hard on that
8264008 hopefully when i come back theyll still want to give me the ball
8264009 the season hasnt started yet its still preseason and preseason is preseason it really doesnt count for anything
8264010 whats the dirty behind the scenes stuff like at north point
8264011 weve had our couple of injuries here too thats all part of the game
8264012 we just have to get him healthy and get him out there
8264013 ive had a chance to look at him on film
8264014 i think hes playing well it doesnt look like he is any different than he was last year he is making great throws
8264015 i havent made any decisions yet on what direction im going to go as far as playing time
8264016 we will just wait until we get to the game day and i will determine how long i want everybody to go
8264017 those things happen and thats all part of the game
8264018 ive played in a lot of games and i hope that works to my advantage
8264019 i feel like ive gotten better on defense but special teams is where im going to make an impact
8264020 i feel comfortable with my assignments ultimately its up to the coaches but i have no regrets on how ive worked and the progress ive made
8264021 do i want him to have more reps yes i would love to have him in there
8264022 but thats the way it is he has to catch up when he can
8264023 but i have my own system i get some hot tea and cold water
8264024 if you get a little tired you splash some on your face
8264025 you always have the challenge as a coach to make sure they dont get bored
8264026 a lot of times ill put new packages in just because of that but sometimes you have to give them a break during the meetings
8264027 yeah weve seen a few guys go to sleep especially the rookies
8264028 a lot of times rookies myself included think well be done by noon and have the rest of the day to hang out but its like a regular day at work youll see a coach call out a guy when hes sleeping hey you see this you see this guy and theyre still knocked out
8264029 i try to bring a little juice and creativity to the presentation
8264030 we dont have many problems at all except sometimes with a veteran who has heard that particular play for the 300th time
8264031 hell tell us to stand up but he pretty much understands he knows the meetings get long and its hard to stay awake hell joke about it sometimes
8264032 a lot of it is on his shoulders for wednesday on how the offense goes
8264033 i have the same mind set as the coaches going into the wednesday morning meeting
8264034 as were in the meeting ill highlight different things i think we should emphasize the main purpose of the meeting is for the offensive line and running backs to find out what running plays we want to attack them with and for the receivers to find out what depth they should run their routes and how the defense may play them im looking at how the cornerbacks play and trying to figure out their weaknesses and strengths
8264035 i usually go through the personnel of the opponent coming up and some of the key things we have to stop
8264036 then we talk about the game plan and i show them a little bit of film of the opponent its definitely one of the most important days
8264037 we have 16 to 20 plays in the walk through
8264038 those are all the new plays shifts formations and motions anything that is new
8264039 if your quarterback doesnt feel good about it you get rid of the play
8264040 you get 150 plays in your game plan and youre going to run 60 of those if our quarterback doesnt feel good about it its gone
8264041 they do a good job of reminding us of that
8264042 there have been times when we had a big win and we come back on wednesday and were looking like crap theyll let us know we might go with pads the next day just to send us a message
8264043 sometimes you have to have patience at the wednesday practice knowing that you put something new in and it might take them a day to learn it
8264044 by friday i want to make sure we have eliminated those mistakes were always putting a new pressure package in every week
8264045 thats the time for the position coaches to get with their players watch some film and get an idea of the guy theyre going against those meetings usually last about an hour
8264046 after the position meetings we come up and look at practice on film and then we start getting ready for the next days practice
8264047 usually im able to leave around 9 30 or 10 oclock a lot of times its a 16 hour day because you just want to make sure you cover everything
8264048 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8264049 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8264050 its just a consequence of the state of the securitisation market
8264051 the cdo explosion went off right in the middle of mannys patch
8264052 heads had to roll and i think manny was a scapegoat

8264059 youve got greg youve got hank and we even worked jason avant in there a little bit this past game
8264060 i dont want to go out there and not be full speed
8264061 if im not full speed ill do what i have to do its strong and feeling good but its got a little ways to go
8264062 its kind of frustrating trying to pick up a position this late in the preseason
8264063 its like all right youve been doing this for a year and a half but now were going to try something different you have to start all over and get on the same page as guys who have been in there doing it so you know it is a little frustrating
8264064 he has to continue to take a step forward i need to see him be better than he was last week
8264065 im not going to say he was poor last week but i want to see improvement he is on his second week here so there should be marked improvement there
8264066 ive only been doing this for a week and a half it would be like me asking you how long it would take you to go be an astronaut

8264170 has now postponed organising chamber music concerts in order to concentrate on the life and times of one of indias great scientists and to look at how his work has been developed and explained
8264171 in hinduism there are two categories of knowledge i para vidya the spiritual knowledge and ii apara vidya material knowledge scientifc knowledge is the realm of apara vidya spiritual knowledge knowledge of god and life belongs to para vidya hinduism points out that scientific knowledge can lead to spiritual knowledge
8264172 i hope that the book and cd will help to make sure that sir j c bose is a little less unsung
8264173 we passed the ball well built the play up well and were quite controlled and had a lot of good moves
8264174 we probably just lacked that cutting edge in the final third
8264175 there were different reasons the ball in wasnt quite right or the run wasnt quite right or the finish
8264176 we came close to being extremely dangerous but didnt quite just put it all together
8264177 the ref accused me of something i didnt do he accused me of abusing the fourth official
8264178 fortunately the fourth official said immediately that i had not done that
8264179 one of the things i pride myself in is honesty and i dont take kindly to being accused of something i didnt do
8264180 my wife is popping out babies like a faucet every day when i come home from work we have another baby long pause weird
8264181 one time when i was visiting a church the pastor said he believed in god but he did not believe the bible i got up and ran out of there as fast as i could now the pastor is dead and is in hell
8264182 the timing is all wrong you have the first game of the season then you go away on international duty
8264183 that is followed by another game this saturday and you go away again for another match that is something that should be looked at
8264184 there are not just demands on my players but those at other clubs as well
8264185 ive been looking at a number of positions and a striker is one of them
8264186 well try and improve the squad we are continuing to look hard but we will obviously have to do it within our means
8264187 allows believers to accept the theory of evolution but such is also taught in our schools and universities

8264190 the only thing harder then being a soldier is loving one
8264191 he needs some minutes on the pitch he has looked sharp in training and it will be good to see him in a game
8264192 it will certainly be a different side from the one that played against hull on saturday
8264193 its a chance to look at other people and other positions but we want to win the game
8264194 its important to keep the momentum going especially after the two results weve had in the premier league
8264195 their league form has not started off that well but that doesnt mean anything its probably a respite for them away from the league
8264196 they play football the right way and alan buckley has done a fantastic job back there
8264197 its a tricky tie for us and we are under no illusions how hard a game its going to be so we will have to be professional and spot on and make sure its not one of those games where we make it too difficult for ourselves
8264198 it would be absolutely fantastic not for me but for the players to walk out at wembley

8264207 we do not have accurate comprehensive information to allow rigorous analysis of what schools and students are achieving this must change

8264210 barack obama is an eloquent speaker and can really fire people up but he doesnt have experience
8264211 the company has decided that for this next critical stage of the age we would have fresh editorial and executive leadership
8264212 andrew has been a highly successful editor he has delivered great papers and has done a magnificent job in reinvigorating
8264213 he has our thanks and appreciation for all he has achieved in the past four years under andrews editorship the age benefited from an innovative redesign and consistent strong growth in circulation and readership and agenda setting journalism

8264217 i guess he just like freaked out and hit his head
8264218 they had to take him to the hospital for stitches
8264219 his addition to the arizona staff is an important piece in the future success of this program
8264220 due to a temporary shortage of er nursing and medical staff at cit de la sant we cannot presently provide medical care for newcomers who come to our emergency room
8264221 consequently if your case is not a major emergency we ask you to go any of the 16 laval medical clinics that provide services without appointment
8264222 we know that weekends are taxing because we have to operate with reduced staff we even have agreements with the concorde sainte doroth e and sainte rose medical clinics that allow for additional nursing personnel to be called in to help them deal with an increase in visitors on saturday and sunday
8264223 its important to note that this annual tradition will give children teens parents and grandparents a chance to enjoy a day of family festivities with a wide range of outdoor activities
8264224 since it was created in 2000 lavals f te de la famille has brought together laval residents from all backgrounds all ages and all neighbourhoods in a festive family atmosphere this day of festivities has something that will appeal to everyone
8264225 i invite our residents to bring along friends and neighbours from nearby municipalities to enjoy this festival which has become something of a labour day weekend tradition
8264226 we are looking for grads of 1959 especially those who have changed their names

8264229 for the past six years ive concentrated our activities around the major annual event its a wonderful occasion to share relate and communicate with each other

8264235 spending on some domestic programs like veterans medical care unemployment benefits and food and nutrition assistance is growing faster than in the comparable period last year
8264236 while our net income for the second quarter was a disappointment i am confident that the issues have been isolated and that our management team has initiated the appropriate actions to correct them
8264237 while we anticipated many of the potential issues with the new system rollout it was still a significant undertaking for our associates
8264238 the new point of sale system ultimately diverted operational focus from key areas of deliveries and cash collection which we can measure and attribute to having a negative effect on easyhomes income all stores are now converted and we expect to have worked through most of the operational transition issues in this quarter

8264244 it spiralled out of control to the ground where there was an enormous bang it was horrifying to watch a few seconds later a big plume of smoke went up
8264245 its a high residential area and there is a school opposite the address so its very fortunate that no other parties have been affected by this
8264246 we fought for it for 13 years and were still fighting for it
8264247 despite our petition the city has done nothing cars go too fast and there are children around if the speed bump was in place for 13 years there must have been a need for it whats happened to this need why doesnt it exist anymore
8264248 it may be silver but its like gold to me
8264249 i executed six high quality dives despite some ups and downs in the preliminaries
8264250 ive really had a difficult year starting on the wrong foot with a fifth place finish at the world cup in february matters worsened when i hurt my back and fractured my foot just four months before the olympics
8264251 coming out of the water i had the shivers all over i knew i had pulled off a superb final dive there are no words to describe what i was feeling
8264252 the objective was to make progress in each step of the competition and thats what i did all doubts were dispelled after a good third dive the one that usually gives me trouble
8264253 im glad for him and happy for me it was a very emotional finish for all of us
8264254 id be lying if i didnt admit to having doubts at that stage of winning anything it just wasnt working i wanted to show the others i was still capable of diving after the injuries but i switched focus and returned to wanting to dive for me to do my thing thats what i did and thats what worked i didnt have to prove anything to anyone i just had to dive my best and thats the way i finally delivered the goods
8264255 i showed i have the potential to dive with the best
8264256 it cost me a place in the finals where i would have competed with the worlds top 12
8264257 but i showed that i could dive with the best in the world i picked up a lot of experience especially since i wasnt really expected to win a medal
8264258 it hurts not to have made the finals i was nervous but whats encouraging is that i came back stronger after flubbing my third dive
8264259 i wasnt intimidated to the contrary it was a source of inspiration for me
8264260 i think its possible but in any case im going to try doing it this coming year

8264272 its real disappointing that rocky is taking a week off like that but well just have to deal with that
8264273 i think its a big shock for all of us but with that ruling it sets a precedent now so there will be nothing of the sort in bringing down lineouts like that even though it wasnt a really bad one it sets a precedent
8264274 had a clear view of the incident and while recognising the admitted illegal interference with matfield by elsom he quite distinctly assessed it as carrying insufficient risk to merit more than a penalty as he reported to referee lyndon bray
8264275 incident was contributed to when elsom lost the support of his lifter
8264276 interference of this kind carries real danger and a sanction is required
8264277 matfield gave telephonic evidence that he suffered an injury in the incident but completed the game without impediment any injury appeared minor and did not influence the decision
8264278 obviously does affect the mix and not just the starting team but the bench as well theres a bit to think about
8264279 barack obama got a special deal from a convicted felon
8264280 as you stand back and look at joe biden you see someone who has spent 30 years dealing with foreign policy but has usually been wrong for 30 years
8264281 at this stage i think where senator mccain is consistent with the position i had
8264282 its a bit like being in the massachusetts statehouse as a republican
8264283 is someone who was a job killing machine in business hes someone who has been proficient at using tax havens in places like the cayman islands that americans have become increasingly tired of
8264284 the truth is the first casualty of the new politics presented by the obama campaign

8264291 bedsy said whats going on with your hair lawsy then he had another go and said hey skunk hair whats going on with your hair then he started pulling on it

8264310 belarus can recognize or not recognize the sovereignty of south ossetia and abkhazia this is the sovereign right of belarus
8264311 but to be honest we are counting on the belarusian side to recognize the sovereignty of abkhazia and south ossetia
8264312 a meeting of the belarusian president with south ossetias eduard kokoity and abkhazias sergei bagapsh took place in sochi evidently the belarusian president gave them his support but then the declaration of south ossetian and abkhazian independence was still a long way off

8264334 there are many things to admire about the new york times a complex and nuanced understanding of the vast diversity of latino america is not among those things the sloppy inaccurate story goes on for 32 agonizing paragraphs using the terms black and latino as though they were mutually exclusive which they are not historians estimate that 95 percent of the african slave trade to the americas took place in latin america the story also erroneously portrays latinos as a race unto themselves an error egregious enough to be stated in our own census bureaus definition of hispanic as a person of any race including black

8264342 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8264343 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know
8264344 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8264345 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8264346 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8264347 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
8264348 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view the speaker agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions she believes that can be done by making family planning more available as well as by increasing the number of comprehensive age appropriate sex education and caring adoption programs the speaker has a long proud record of working with the catholic church on many issues including alleviating poverty and promoting social justice and peace
8264349 that debate in our church has not morphed but changed over a thousand years
8264350 it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
8264351 its been pretty clear thats been automatic moment of conception
8264352 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8264353 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8264354 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8264355 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case

8264373 hes the best player and best person i have ever coached in 15 years he has it all i think hes going to play offense in college with the way he moves they might consider him for defense

8264377 we need to continue to assist the chinese transplantation program to enter the mainstream of transplantation globally through the use of brain dead and living donors
8264378 certainly china has taken significant steps to make changes and were optimistic the change process will be strong and will reduce the use of executed prisoners for transplants which we are against under any circumstances
8264379 the open question remains what will china be like post olympics

8264391 teacher morale problems stemming from the creation of unfair competition

8264397 what was the role of atty santos in this issue what was his motive who was he representing given that he is the first gentlemans lawyer it would be best for malaca ang to come forward and explain whether or not santos was acting on behalf of the presidents husband
8264398 if his acts were true these are unethical acts and must be addressed by the supreme court
8264399 he santos talked to a relative of the justice there is a witness against him and his circumstance at gsis
8264400 indiscreet act which might be construed as a violation of the anti graft and corrupt practices act when one officer tries to influence official transactions that might be to his advantage
8264401 any communication no matter how innocuous should be deemed an offense that way no one would be tempted to make just a mere phone call text or fax message said santiago referring to santos phone call to the pcgg chair
8264402 long time friend having known him before martial law and getting from him legal advice which enabled santos to win a class suit against national power corp for deaths of 300 people caused by the release of water from angat dam at the height of a typhoon in 1978
8264403 i thought it was my legal and moral duty to help the gsis on my own
8264404 i told him please help to serve the ends of justice said santos
8264405 you see in this case of meralco against gsis we are citizens of the country we are the consumers being victimized by meralco

8264461 woodside must pass on increased costs including taxes to customers over time
8264462 the idea that we will somehow absorb this cost is unrealistic it will be passed on as we reopen and renew domestic contracts
8264463 the green paper could actually increase worldwide carbon pollution as it basically makes lng opportunities much harder and encourages coal
8264464 there are still large parts of the economy that are doing extraordinarily well and where the demand for labour is still very strong
8264465 more stable parts of the economy like finance and property and business services and hairdressing are going to feel the pinch as well
8264466 were not an efficient manufacturer generally speaking we certainly cant compete with low labour cost countries
8264467 throwing protectionist money at these industries might help short term but i dont think its going to hold back time
8264468 there is another 6 billion of projects at some time over the coming years we are working on those today and they will become project starts in the next few years so weve got plenty in the hopper
8264469 our business is probably acting consistently with what we all read about the us economy
8264470 the consumer is getting whacked around right now and the end result is that we have slightly negative sales in the us which is probably a good result in this environment because we have always felt that our malls provide a strong resilience when there are headwinds because we have got higher levels of occupancy strong retailers and strong tenants
8264471 london is a very we feel underserviced city in any case with regards to retailing infrastructure and the two projects we are doing there we expect to get very good long term returns off that because of that

8264473 allegations of that kind are rejected by my client in the strongest possible terms
8264474 i have always found michael to be open and to have high integrity in his dealings with me
8264475 to our mind there has been a systematic misappropriation of funds by mr brereton for his own use and benefit and for the use and benefit of his business partner
8264476 his conduct is disgraceful and dishonourable and clearly constitutes misconduct at common law
8264477 at last i understand why foreigners always set the iron ore price and china always loses
8264478 does bhp billiton hold chinese law in contempt by acting so brazenly in front of so many eyes at the olympics

8264485 could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit
8264486 effectively robbing one of the most poor and disenfranchised people in this country of the right to earn a living and potentially achieve an equity stake in a major mining project
8264487 we have numerous uranium mining opportunities on our land including the major kintyre deposit
8264488 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state
8264489 this is an important intergenerational issue for our people and its an issue that martu should be able to consider and make decisions about in an informed manner
8264490 there have been a lot of questions especially from the us about why macquarie had been holding up recently after what has happened to babcock amp brown and that sooner or later the negative sentiment was going to flow through to them

8264492 we see the media sector as still growing but we havent as yet said by what percentage that might be weve previously seen growth of 7 but were keeping it under review
8264493 we have a very good suite of assets with strong cash generating potential
8264494 our aim is to maximise the amount off cash that reaches shareholders every dollar spent above the road needs to add value
8264495 that diversification of our product lines our business lines and our geography has given us low volatility and resilient earnings and thats underpinned that earnings per share growth since our inception
8264496 no one else can match us for breadth and reach of coverage in regional australia
8264497 we also think thats about the fact that we can offer these advertisers that unique ability to reach their audiences throughout the day via different media radio as the call to action tv to build their brands
8264498 this movement represents a small movement in net outflows combined with an unfavourable decline in the market value of equities over this period

8264514 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8264515 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8264516 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8264517 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8264518 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8264519 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8264520 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8264521 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8264522 one day our generation is gonna rule the population so we keep on waiting waiting on the world to change

8264555 the cost of running the holiday is certainly substantially greater than the suppliers envisaged particularly because of fuel prices and a number of companies are running into serious difficulties and some of them are unable to continue
8264556 tour operators are sticking to the brochure prices issued at the start of the summer so thats what you will get your holiday for
8264557 winter brochures are already out and there are no plans at the moment to charge the customer for fuel surcharges but its such a volatile market
8264558 the airlines are imposing the fuel surcharges and thats just a fact of life now
8264559 as far as the passengers on holiday now are concerned there should not be any problems
8264560 if they turn up at the airports with their tickets they should be accommodated on a flight

8264608 examination of modern new testament text criticism theory and methods version 2
8264609 modern text critics have never answered the points raised in this essay although the weighty arguments were cited within 2 years of the publication of the text critical method
8264610 it must not be overlooked however that though some anomalies are the result of corruption in the transmission of the text other anomalies may have been either intended or tolerated by the
8264611 how then can epp assert this is where we stand and this is precisely where westcott hort stood
8264612 the guiding light of the neutral text which westcott and hort followed no longer shines
8264613 most scholars have abandoned horts optimistic view that codex vaticanus b contains the original text almost unchanged except for slips of the pen
8264614 it was only his posthumous followers chiefly hills who claimed that he burgon built his entire textual method on a dogmatic foundation
8264615 the greek text underlying the english authorized version of 1611 as published by the trinitarian bible society in 1976
8264616 the time is ripe for a revision of the hortian view which will effectually free new testament textual criticism from the shackles of another rigorous critical orthodoxy

8264619 there is a pattern on both sides which is observable and the fact is that the tr flows from revival whereas the modern text flows from apostasy

8264622 doctrinally there is no question where erasmus stood our perception is not limited to a few hints or suggestions a deduction here or an inference there boldly and repeatedly erasmus declares himself to be a loyal and devoted romanist consenting to all that rome stood for doctrinally with its mary worship veneration of the saints sacrifice of the mass papal supremacy purgatory monastic vows and orders and all else he refused to side with luther and vigorously opposed the protestant reformation he sought and got the popes sanction for his new testament

8264625 the first to articulate that burgons views were unanswered and unanswerable was burgon himself revision revised 36 one is tempted to think that these later writers have simply taken burgons word on the matter without bothering to research the discussion in the last 100 years
8264626 examination of modern new testament text criticism theory and methods
8264627 this is why so much space has been given in the present essay for refutation of westcott and hort modern text critics conclusions are in practice identical with those of westcott and hort
8264628 the significance of the papyri for progress in new testament research
8264629 a completely new form of the text and apparatus was being prepared by k aland
8264630 the early papyri illustrate well how the nt greek text had been circulating in many and divergent forms proceeding in different directions at about the same time in the same ecclesiastical province in my opinion an entirely new phase began in nt textual criticism when this began to be recognized this new phase can be seen as beginning in the thirties when the chester beatty papyri had become known and were being discussed or to put it more cautiously scholars should then have begun to be more aware of the change which these papyri had introduced in the field of textual criticism
8264631 the significance of the papyri for progress in new testament research
8264632 the majority text and the original text are they identical
8264633 an evaluation of john w burgons use of patristic evidence
8264634 it must be pointed out and this applies not only to epp but to some others as well that all this talk of the westcott hort text to which all modern hand editions supposedly conform closely if they are not reviving the textus receptus is not only somewhat oversimplified but downright false
8264635 of course none of these translations asv rsv nasb niv neb tev and njb slavishly followed the printed text of any of these editions for the translators operated according to the principle of eclecticism usually choosing a reading from a particular text and occasionally adopting a reading from the critical apparatus
8264636 liberia hosts the last two significant blocks of the remaining closed canopy tropical rainforest within the upper guinea forests of west africa this is largely due to the fact that liberias forest and natural resource especially timber was sustainably managed before the liberian civil crisis the upper guinea forests has now shrunk to an estimated 12 7 of its original size estimated to be 727 900 square kilometers almost 42 of this remaining forest is in liberia although other factors contribute to the problem of deforestation in liberia logging companies have remained the single most destructive force and were responsible for the larger percentage of deforestation for example from 1997 to 2001 log production increased by more than a staggering 1 300 unsurprisingly this had an enormous impact on indigenous rural communities and local people who depend on the land and the forest for their livelihood their cultural and spiritual practices are so dependent on the forest that with the rapid loss of forest the survival and growth of these communities was severely endangered the livelihood of rural people the overwhelming percentage of liberians is inextricably linked to the forest they depend on the land and the forest for food clean water medicine and other forest products for survival their relationship with the forest is the cornerstone for their cultural and spiritual practices for instance in the poro and sande societies traditional bush schools can only be conducted in very isolated highly forested areas where hunting and survival skills are taught traditional legal institutions especially those involving elders and zoes elders who make up the supreme decision making body in rural communities usually sit in the deep forest to hear cases of grave significance to the people because the forest is so central to their lives the destruction of the forest will ultimately have severe consequences for future generations the oriental timber company was symbolic of what has been wrong with the liberian logging industry from grand bassa through rivercess to sinoe county the company spearheaded the destruction of the forest this fragmentation of the forest significantly contributed to the massive displacement of wildlife while rendering them vulnerable to hunting contrary to what the logging companies explain is development roads constructed by them were primarily to facilitate harvesting and delivery of logs several dozen logging roads of absolutely no value to local people when the company moved out severely fragmented the forest the most noticeable social impact on local communities where logging companies set up bush camps was the introduction of prostitution drugs alcohol and gangsterism most teenage girls involved in prostitution only returned to their homes when they realized that they were pregnant

8264658 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
8264659 our results demonstrate that heritable mutations of alk are the main cause of familial neuroblastoma and that germline or acquired activation of this cell surface kinase is a tractable therapeutic target for this lethal paediatric malignancy
8264660 it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
8264661 this finding means that it is possible to offer simple non invasive screening for patients with a family history of neuroblastoma
8264662 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile

8264779 did you see what i did to those anarchist bastards that ought to hold them for a while
8264780 resolve to prevent the forces of intolerance fear and hatred from ever again uniting to overcome the rationality wisdom and fairness to which our legal system aspires
8264781 i disagree with what the majority of the american people want
8264782 anyone with any security experience would be embarrassed to put his name to the design
8264783 most of the people who use buses are low income
8264784 so it fare increases really impacts them we are putting in effort to try and reach them
8264785 then people will use the system more and it will improve
8264786 that there is a group mobilizing forces from across the country and amassing exotic weapons that they refuse to disclose to the public they have a record of inflicting violence on unarmed civilians and illegally spying on citizens working toward positive change they even dress in black they are the denver police and the various local state and federal forces that will be transforming denver into a miniature version of the occupation of iraq when the dnc comes to town
8264787 sometimes its more advantageous for the union to not strike the company has to get their scabs in hotels and be ready to go and theyre paying us to work
8264788 it worked for the union last time im hoping it works this time as well
8264789 the problem is the people who get hired after this is settled will instead of benefits basically get 430 for each year of service once they retire which is hardly anything
8264790 it will definitely get ratified by the locals its a good contract
8264791 both sides were entering with open minds with the goal of arriving at a fair contract
8264792 more now than ever it is such a huge issue for the company
8264793 if we went on strike there were no people who they could hired who could set it up the right way
8264794 they basically realized that they had to settle or risk loosing a whole lot more on their fios investment
8264795 a dieing breed of american jobs that pays a living wage pays benefit that actually takes care of its employees
8264796 crossing the picket line is like punching your mother you cant undo once its done
8264797 weve got to fight with every ounce we have in us to keep whats left cause when you give up stuff they never give it back if we were to give and inch on retiree benefits they will never get that back and next contract the companys going to ask for 2 inches
8264798 where there is a real and substantial risk to the life as to opposed to the health of the mother excluding self termination
8264799 borders iran as well as russia and vast oil pipelines cross it
8264800 killings burning and looting by irregular militias coming in behind russian military columns thrusting from south ossetia deep into the country
8264801 we refuse to take sides in wars between states and extend support and solidarity only to the ordinary people who suffer
8264802 the warfare began aug 7 when georgia launched a barrage targeting south ossetia
8264803 a key tool that the soviet union used to keep its empire together was pitting ethnic groups against one another
8264804 obamas not a veteran hes not a veteran why should i trust him
8264805 my reform will improve care reduce risks and broaden access all at the same time
8264806 whats he know a one term senator not a veteran
8264807 things are going either moderately badly or very badly in iraq
8264808 the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war no matter how justified shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of early wars were treated and appreciated by our nation

8264813 im a little surprised because economists are using sophisticated models
8264814 it is amazing that economists on the average cannot out forecast households
8264815 i think its partly because inflation is hard to forecast even the weather plays a part
8264816 i think some of these basic things that affect prices nobody can forecast households or professional economists
8264817 households are right there in the nitty gritty seeing what groceries are doing when they go to the store seeing what gas prices are doing
8264818 no weekday cartoons no cable none of it sometime when i was in highschool she caved but by that time id been bread with a certain distaste for television and particularly the clamorous advertising that goes with it
8264819 ive heard from mothers struggling to make ends meet because their salaries arent keeping up with the cost of groceries
8264820 but if they take a second job they cant afford the additional cost of childcare or the moms who are nervous about taking time from their jobs to care for a sick child or the moms to be who are scared of getting fired if the boss finds out theyre pregnant then there are women who work hard every day doing the same jobs as men but earning less these struggles the struggles of working women and families across new to me or to any of us
8264821 the food service equipment group posted fourth quarter year over year sales growth of 8 1 percent and 16 1 percent operating income growth
8264822 i believe the fundamental values of co operation members involvement democracy people working together are exactly what we need in scotland as we take forward a range of policies not just to tackle problems but also to build on peoples aspirations labour needs to win the battle of ideas with the nationalists identifying the problems is not enough labour needs a leader who can drive us to find the solutions that scotland needs

8264825 hell bring quality and competition for places which is what we want hopefully we can take him to another level here at sunderland
8264826 he has come through the ranks at west ham and maybe just needs a change
8264827 it was hard leaving west ham because i have been there for 16 years but after meeting roy keane i knew it was time for a change
8264828 this is a great challenge for me and i feel it is an exciting time at sunderland i think the move will do me good
8264829 im interesse des turners und seiner entwicklung ist die ffentliche auseinandersetzung zu beenden
8264830 im ersten moment war es schwierig aber jetzt bin ich super gl cklich mit meiner bronzemedaille
8264831 a lot of them just shrug and go ahead with the connection potentially opening themselves up to attack
8264832 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8264833 we dont have a system here the government does not have a solution
8264834 if we did not have foreigners here i dont think the afghan national army or police would come out of their bases
8264835 if just 20 or 30 police had come round from the side they could have stopped them
8264836 its a very tough situation for people like me who helped the government
8264837 i receive calls and they ask are you still alive
8264838 the government also warned him the taliban insurgents were plotting his assassination and yet he maintained that they are not powerful
8264839 i dont think so it is the government that is weak
8264840 the government has the facilities weapons and equipment but we dont have the shepherds
8264841 people already did not believe in the government so it doubled their disbelief in the government
8264842 we dont know exactly if the taliban is powerful we have heard that
8264843 but when we see this kind of attack it seems they are very powerful
8264844 i would suggest it wasnt as strong as it could have been
8264845 the canadians are here but things are getting worse and worse
8264846 the police will have to work hard for a while
8264847 man is a clever animal who behaves like an imbecile
8264848 i became suspicious when i could not see any charitable number
8264849 its written in such a way to make you think that you are giving direct to a charity but it is a profit making organisation
8264850 what really upset me as well was bringing religion into it which would appeal to many unsuspecting people
8264851 members of the public are again being targeted by commercial clothing collectors and consumers need to be aware that these companies will sell their items for profit and charities will not benefit from their generosity

8264859 the rumours and speculation and information from sources arent what were going to deal with
8264860 were going to deal with facts that we find through our investigation
8264861 those kinds of questions will definitely be asked and will be answered
8264862 this decision has only been made after every other avenue has been explored
8264863 it is extremely rare for the agency to evict people from their homes when acquiring land for a road scheme but unfortunately in this instance we have no choice
8264864 theyve got to come and grab me and put handcuffs on and take me out the door theres no other way they can do it is there

8264883 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently the government newspaper
8264884 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse mr mugabe told the lunch
8264885 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day mr mugabe said
8264886 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate mdc spokesman nelson chamisa said
8264887 hijack the leadership of zimbabwe and said the veteran leader was trying to ride roughshod over his political opponents
8264888 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8264889 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on mr chamisa said
8264890 but there hasnt been any formal communication from sadc from president mbeki to say this is the way forward

8264931 it hasnt been just one or two guys carrying the weight and the accompanying pressure everyone has stepped up and thats allowed an opportunity for recovery across the board the team effort has paid off it has created a team camaraderie and confidence that has been a significant contributing factor to our results this season well be looking to make a mark in greenville
8264932 in my opinion this is the perfect spot for brunch lunch

8264935 we will not recommend a cbi probe to the centre into the kanpur blast in which two suspected bajrang dal workers were killed alone
8264936 we have written a letter to the centre today suggesting that all bomb blast incidents in the state in the last few years be included in the cbi probe
8264937 these include serial blasts in civil court premises in varanasi faizabad and lucknow and terror attack on the crpf camp at rampur

8264942 after listening to the radio for half an hour students have improved significantly watching tv they can observe and listen but for the radio they ave to concentrate on the subject only by listening through radio we are imparting general knowledge to the students they have been told about their regular syllabus a revision of the same lesson first in classroom and then on radio will enable students to be more proficient

8264973 they didnt tell me anything about it as a first time horse owner i trusted the vet to tell me if there was going to be any implications or could be

8264977 she is female which addresses the novelty of the opposition she is smart and well respected she is knowledgeable on key issues especially domestic policy
8264978 shes been around for decades and is not going to start making mistakes now
8264979 her nomination would be a signal to american women that mccain takes their aspirations seriously even if obama does not hutchison is not charismatic but her circumstances would be if she were nominated the prospect of a woman vice president would electrify women throughout the nation
8264980 she has clearly set her sights on governor and looks at that as the way she wants to complete her long and distinguished career of public service
8264981 the conservatives could probably stomach hutchison a lot better than a tom ridge or joe lieberman
8264982 she is a woman and their strategy seems to be to go for disaffected clinton voters but i would say this is more like the chet edwards boomlet it raises the profile there is no downside to being mentioned but hutchison at this point looks like a last minute ploy not a considered judgment
8264983 ok shes not a dynamo of fiery charisma in fact as ive noted before shes a bland and sometimes boring speaker and a pleasant if unprepossessing television presence nevertheless she is a she and that fact in itself would allow mccains choice to upstage obamas
8264984 she wouldnt add much to the slate but she is a southerner and female

8265035 shes straight down the line fbi who has been exposed to this other world and is reeling from trying to comprehend it
8265036 she wrangles peter and walter in and maintains the focus of the trio
8265037 we were talking about how much we missed working on a tv show together
8265038 though that character was very different from walter bishop we thought theres a series about a guy like this
8265039 the truth is that the fans of lost or alias are the people we are beholden to
8265040 i actually dont think of them as fans the people who are into those shows are also fans of the shows that i am interested in

8265057 der zuschauer hat ein recht darauf sport als spa zu erleben
8265058 dmitri medwedew der erste russische pr sident der sich als politiker bereits nach dem kalten krieg geformt hat hat den letzten nagel in den sarg des systems eingetrieben das schon l ngst seine effektivit t und angemessenheit verloren aber die weltgemeinschaft immer fter in eine sackgasse gef hrt hat
8265059 sobald im westen die emotionale phase der reaktion auf moskaus entschluss vorbei ist werden dort viele einen erleichterungsseufzer aussto en weil sie verstehen werden dass dmitri medwedew ihnen freie hand gelassen und im grunde einen entscheidenden schritt zur herausbildung einer neuen weltordnung getan hat
8265060 zweifellos bietet das allen sowohl russland als auch dem westen neue m glichkeiten in der welt das wichtigste ist hier sich nicht von der au enpolitischen taktik und dem streben nach gegenseitiger bestrafung fortrei en zu lassen und nicht diese in der geschichte seltenen strategischen m glichkeiten zur umgestaltung der welt nach eigenem willen zu vers umen
8265061 ein solches beitrittsstreben k nnte zum jetzigen zeitpunkt uns einen b rendienst erweisen denn das w rde als eine annexion aussehen deswegen wird dieses thema bis auf weiteres auf eis gelegt
8265062 wir haben ernsthaft vor uns weiter zu entwickeln und wollen diese pl ne nicht ber den haufen werfen
8265063 wir wollen in russland langfristig bleiben die verk ufe von general motors in russland belegen zahlenm ig platz zwei in europa und wir wollen in der zweiten jahresh lfte 2008 auch den ersten platz erreichen
8265064 es gab keine verspannung zu versp ren ganz im gegenteil alle entwicklungspl ne sehen vor unsere gesch fte und russland auszubauen die muttergesellschaft warf uns sogar vor uns nicht schnell genug in russland zu entwickeln
8265065 russland bleibt f r uns ein vorzugsmarkt langfristig werden wir alles daran setzen um die konkurrenzf higkeit des russischen marktes durch unsere innovationen zu st rken
8265066 wir haben keinen grund ber die einschr nkung unserer gesch ftst tigkeit in russland zu sprechen
8265067 2008 wird der russische markt f r pharmaprodukte beeindruckende wachstumsraten zeigen bis zu 30 prozent bis jahresende
8265068 die einschr nkung des imports des amerikanischen gefl gels wird ergeben dass in unseren gesch ften ein gesundes kologisch reines nahrungsmittel auf die theke kommt

8265075 soul calibur as with many fighting games has struggled over the last few years to maintain positive feedback with each new instalment soul calibur 4 takes the leap onto the next generation consoles and comes packed with promises of an experience that many deem extinct any fighting genre fan will no doubt agree that the original soul calibur was one of the best fighting games ever made and we can all only hope that the promises made for the latest instalment are kept jumping right into the menu you will find a fantastic array of choices as modes are strewn throughout the game

8265083 everybody needs to work like everybody else and prove he deserves to play
8265084 i guess its moving on again from the last album 2006s smear campaign its still very fast and hopefully heavy theres a couple of strange kind of moments in the music with a little more experimentation and a little more discordance in the guitar perhaps i think barney s greenway trying to move forward vocally in some areas like he did on tracks like smear campaign and persona non grata
8265085 we went through its pretty well documented on our dvd elegies when we were talking about where we were as a band there was a period where nobody wanted to really touch us we said back then when the band went through this weird dark period and when we came out of it one of the things we said was we need to get to a point where a band like metallica says we need to take that band on tour and this year that whole thing happened man its surreal
8265086 metallica does not need machine head to open up for them to bring people into the arena they are doing us the biggest favor that anybody could ever do for a band it puts you in front of an arena full of people that potentially you can win over thats amazing that speaks volumes for the dudes that they are we couldnt be more honored we couldnt be more were blown away by it
8265087 wir f hren 1 0 und wir haben eine mannschaft die nicht einfach zu schlagen ist
8265088 wenn wir zu defensiv spielen ist das sicher schlecht wir sollten unbedingt versuchen selbst ein tor zu schie en
8265089 die wahrheit zeigt sich immer auf dem platz wir haben schon h ufiger gute spieler ausschalten k nnen
8265090 in der vorsaison hatten wir in porto eine hnliche ausgangsposition und sind weitergekommen dann gegen barcelona
8265091 daraus haben wir gelernt wir m ssen heute anders spielen m glichst selbst ein tor schie en das w re schon die halbe miete
8265092 die spielen fu ball im grenzbereich das wissen wir aus dem hinspiel
8265093 es wird zwar noch ein gespr ch mit dem trainer geben aber ich glaube nicht dass ich spielen kann
8265094 es hat keinen sinn f r mein spiel brauche ich 100 prozent
8265095 he fooled the heck out of me that is all i have got to say
8265096 we had another one in june same thing they approached an elderly man
8265097 if you were a player and youre looking over in that other dugout youll feel a certain type of way rewind the game just watch the game
8265098 it is essential we have a formal voice in our working conditions
8265099 we fight for change for better safer working conditions as well as providing a higher level of service to the community
8265100 the question for me is why are we doing this and why do we need to do this now
8265101 my point is that if there is no problem why are we changing anything
8265102 have escalated to levels equivalent to military small unit combat and have included use of machine guns and fragmentation grenades
8265103 public shootings have occurred during daylight hours near shopping areas in some cases assailants have worn full or partial police or military uniforms and have used vehicles that resemble police vehicles
8265104 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8265105 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8265106 were now on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8265107 there are no more clinton supporters who arent on board
8265108 they wanted to see her experience her to feel her energy and share her joy
8265109 those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama
8265110 my mother was born before women could vote but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8265111 there were times i felt she was really trying to talk to me
8265112 nothing will ever be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome
8265113 we talked about the fundamentals of running city council and how we could do it better
8265114 if pedrow decides he wants to take some action thats up to him
8265115 we opted to continue running treated water into the irrigation system for the remainder of the summer to get folks by
8265116 and of course we will continue to do that but next year is a whole different animal frankly we dont have the capacity or the water to be able to do that on a regular basis
8265117 the implications are that they are not going to build it
8265118 centex said they werent going to build it and centex said they had just found out monday longs peak water was shutting off in spring
8265119 they claimed that they did not know the longs peak water was going to be shut off i find that very hard to believe
8265120 were continuing in discussions with the local water district to determine a resolution were currently evaluating a number of options to see that our commitments are fulfilled regarding the water system
8265121 can you imagine what this will do to the value of our home
8265122 one of my neighbors said i just put 20 000 into my backyard and i just spent my summer and 8 000 in my backyard and for what
8265123 but you know that was going to be the house of our dreams
8265124 were you in it for me or were you in it for insert marginalized group
8265125 to those who said they would vote for mccain over obama who more likely than not are die hard feminists think about pro choice issues childrens issues health care issues insurance coverage of contraception issues where will he look out for your interests there
8265126 she cares about the environment more than her own comfort or her own privacy
8265127 shes happy as a lark to be in the electric car
8265128 were taking a leap from the phonograph to beyond the ipod
8265129 right now somewhere in iraq a scene like this is playing itself out often with deadly results
8265130 i saw the actual injustices that were happening and participated in them because i had to
8265131 we hung in there we just had a few plays go the other way
8265132 i told the girls from the beginning that we have a lot of speed on the team and were definitely going to take advantage of that and get the girls moving
8265133 i got a little too crazy there but those are the chances i have to take as a head coach
8265134 thats what every kicker should dream about right there is a chance to win a big game like that
8265135 dave told me hed be wearing green and gold at the game
8265136 hes in a good situation if cu wins hell be happy but if csu wins hell be happier for ben
8265137 weve done that on purpose i like to give all those kids as much opportunity as we can to be the starter
8265138 with that i made certain all of them got the same amount of reps because if anyone of them went down it would put a strain on what we do
8265139 i feel bad for jason being a senior and all
8265140 i like jason hes a good guy but ive got to take the ball and run with it its an opportunity for me and hell be back while hes gone ive got to make the best of it and have a blast go with it and have fun
8265141 its all mental thats what i tell myself you dont worry about how many people are there how big the game is it needs to be just like kicking up at steamboat
8265142 we need leadership as good as our people and we dont have it
8265143 how were going to deal with the rise of radical islamic fundamentalism
8265144 to deliver an energy package to free us from the iron grip of the oligarchy
8265145 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8265146 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8265147 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8265148 proud supporter of obama clinton dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8265149 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8265150 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8265151 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8265152 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8265153 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8265154 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8265155 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8265156 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8265157 i have a hard time letting myself go because sometimes i want to hold back
8265158 but ive learned each season that i can let go more and more
8265159 getting 21st in the whole state as a sophomore was pretty cool
8265160 i was really excited to end the season that way
8265161 but i have more in me than i think i do
8265162 i plan on being better this year than i ever have been
8265163 im pretty impressed with the dedication they have shown in running over the summer
8265164 i need to be in my own head instead of looking around
8265165 i cant be overly excited or scared anymore i need to focus on each race
8265166 i fear i wont have anything left at the end of a race
8265167 i always have their runs getting faster as the workout progresses
8265168 whether theyre intervals or a long run i recommend them to go out on a 30 minute run and then turn back and run back in 25
8265169 its fun because its different and hes shown us some different things its not always the same
8265170 running can add up it can be a pretty tough sport on the legs whatever i can do to prevent injury and give them a mental break im going to do
8265171 it looks like she has some genetic potential she can make it look easy
8265172 if she has the proper guidance i think she can show more potential
8265173 really though nothing matters until that regional or state meet everything is a practice race to get better and better so there are no excuses by the time the big races come
8265174 we have some quality experience coming back and some good newcomers
8265175 we just want to get further this season thats the big thing
8265176 the boys are shooting for a top 10 finish again
8265177 many young girls got a taste of state they could move into a top 15 state finish
8265178 we expect to be very good but we have some question marks too
8265179 our boys and girls teams come back with experienced athletes in cross country but we are deeper with a lot of new talent
8265180 we have not set anything yet and i kind of want to leave it that way for a little awhile
8265181 i can leave it open until the day before ive done that before if theyre that close i dont mind them feeling the pressure that they have to compete that long
8265182 it depends more on what they show me this week in practice
8265183 im not concerned about it because all of those guys have gotten better
8265184 im sure its a source of anxiety for these four guys who are competing but thats ok
8265185 whoever he chooses to put in its going to be the best for the team and thats the main goal to win
8265186 all of us are really good were just trying to represent this college i feel really good i just have to get the plays down
8265187 i think it means we have to be more leaders and know what were doing even more so
8265188 if coach doesnt feel confidence in our guard positions then he has to have confidence in us three now
8265189 theyre all trying to get ready to play whether all four will well find out

8265214 unser unternehmen hat in den vergangenen wochen seine vertriebsstruktur reorganisiert und sein gesamtes sales team konstant weiter ausgebaut
8265215 i was happy even to win any games after that first set
8265216 i was like i need to win a game so i was really happy
8265217 now its just a matter of fine tuning some things
8265218 hes growing up and hopefully by his senior year hell be mentally and physically stronger and hell be someone to watch
8265219 i may have a tree out there by the end of his senior year
8265220 people expect you to be really good and to win
8265221 so theres a lot of pressure to win matches and thats really hard when youre playing everyones best player but i like the pressure i think it helps me
8265222 you can tell hes a lot more composed out there
8265223 he just seems to have a lot more confidence and hes swinging through the ball
8265224 i think we only won four matches last season but we should definitely be over 500 this year
8265225 we have a great bunch of guys i can only see us going up if the boys keep on playing and i think they want to
8265226 i think its a pretty exciting time to be apart of longmont tennis
8265227 but this is something you can do inside or out
8265228 it is a type of evidence i think would have a tendency to make a jury perhaps get off the task of what they are supposed to do
8265229 the robinho deal is continuing to rumble on and it will probably go to the wire
8265230 there are two players the manager luiz felipe scolari identified when he came here deco and robinho
8265231 we seen have already seen the impact deco has made on the premier league the squad is strong and with him robinho it will have that added dimension

8265233 when you see things like this its no wonder the people voted no to the lisbon treaty this will be the end of the traditional baking competition at local shows across the country therefore impacting on local revenue its just ridiculous

8265244 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8265245 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8265246 everybody was tired of hearing about it so they finally had to step up and do something to make a change
8265247 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8265248 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8265249 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8265250 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8265251 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8265252 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8265253 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8265254 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8265255 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8265256 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing
8265257 america has never been afraid of the future and we shouldnt start now

8265267 but did you see the size of those front teeth of his he must use those white strip things
8265268 the things he said about politics were wonderful as were his comments regarding democrats
8265269 whatever he specifically may or may not have said was nothing compared to his four inch wide smile span i cant say with certainty that the teeth are even real
8265270 he said something about presumptive presidential nominee obamas energy policy right and plausibly he spoke about global warming and negatively discussed the bush administration well lets assume he did those things anyway so therefore we dont agree
8265271 ich verstehe nicht warum er in dieser situation keinen enthaftungsantrag gestellt hat
8265272 mir hat er nur gesagt dass er sich nicht schuldig bekennt und er sich die vorw rfe nicht erkl ren kann

8265277 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8265278 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8265279 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8265280 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president
8265281 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8265282 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president

8265290 eu tenho tido mais contato com a campanha de mccain desde a indica o do que com a campanha de obama
8265291 eu acredito que existe uma grande quantidade de recursos que n o ser o absorvidos pela campanha de obama se n o tiver engajamento do pessoal da hillary clinton
8265292 an unorthodox country first lieberman selection would reinforce what has been attractive about mccain and what has allowed him to run ahead of though not yet enough ahead of the generic republican ballot
8265293 joe lieberman is a dangerous pick but he also has a huge upside
8265294 to me he wouldnt be the best pick but he wouldnt be the worst either
8265295 the domestic issues on which republicans and mr lieberman have major differences are pressing and cannot be ignored

8265301 he uses his fame money and notoriety through his music and videos to perpetuate and foster the image the image of colton city crips dominance of arbor terrance apartments and the surrounding area

8265323 what scraps of credibility abdullah had left after march 8 are gone
8265324 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8265325 what happened was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8265326 so that abdullah will realize that his leadership is no longer wanted
8265327 with anwar ibrahim in parliament we cannot afford mukhriz and azmin to have a weak leadership because it could lead to our downfall
8265328 the walls are crumbling but the top guy seems oblivious to his surroundings
8265329 obviously i think this is one of those things that travellers are going to expect and airlines will feel the need to provide
8265330 we have talked to both of the canadian carriers as well as carriers in mexico
8265331 all of them have shown a lot of interest were a little bit further along with some than others in getting to an agreement with them
8265332 we are actively engaged in discussions with in flight internet providers and are expecting to make further announcements later this autumn
8265333 its definitely something we have been looking at weve looked at a couple of different options
8265334 the airlines are looking for any sort of revenue they can get
8265335 it makes very good sense to have it on an airplane for a reasonable price
8265336 there are good possibility that the player transfer to roma and that will happen today has declared bernes to
8265337 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
8265338 i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8265339 i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club
8265340 i think i show that in the way i play every week i also have far too much respect for the people of manchester and england to criticise them in this way
8265341 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8265342 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again
8265343 the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8265344 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather
8265345 in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8265346 its not only the weather that im not happy about here in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar
8265347 in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8265348 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8265349 the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time of all
8265350 theyre the cutest children in the world but are they ready to lead

8265354 he got up in the ninth and i called out to the bullpen and told him to sit back down
8265355 expertise gained from our quebec shale play has allowed us to re evaluate our past results
8265356 we believe we have been able to correlate the results to particular shale qualities which greatly encourage us that a predictive model can be created the very high gas in place numbers and promising production results from our two wells in the liard shales make this test very interesting
8265357 we also see the value in the continuation of the development of the upper shales which have produced strongly over the past two years and believe this work program will highlight the shale commerciality in the liard basin
8265358 im excited about how this release balances our goals of providing a great experience to those who have genuine windows and at the same time creating a compelling experience for those who have non genuine copies to get genuine windows
8265359 so its scribble scribble scribble all through dinner into the notebook go long descriptions of landscape and character some fuzzy intellection scraps of conversation diagrammatic drawings paras from the local paper weather notes shopping lists inventories of interiors the sad cafe gets grimly itemized skeletal anecdotes names of birds trees and plants culled from the wonderfully useful peterson guides phone numbers of people whom ill never call the daily target practice of a dozen or so experimental similes
8265360 any of us who write know how true that is how we struggle to find just the right word or phrase and how it just comes to us sometimes from we know not where
8265361 the act of writing itself unlocks the memory bank and discovers things that are neither in the notebooks nor to be found in the writers conscious memory
8265362 one man may paint a picture from a careful drawing made on the spot and another may paint the same scene from memory from a brief but strong impression and the last may succeed better in giving the character the physiognomy of the place though all the details may be inexact
8265363 the way they planned it tonight was supposed to be sort of the personal
8265364 but i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about barack obama commander in chief tax cuts et cetera et cetera
8265365 you havent heard about iraq or john mccain or george w

8265371 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently the government newspaper
8265372 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse mr mugabe told the lunch
8265373 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day mr mugabe said
8265374 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate mdc spokesman nelson chamisa said
8265375 hijack the leadership of zimbabwe and said the veteran leader was trying to ride roughshod over his political opponents
8265376 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8265377 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on mr chamisa said

8265423 it is important to understand that pancreatitis an inflammatory condition of the pancreas is a rare event further the characteristics and complications of the pancreatitis cases in patients on byetta are consistent with pancreatitis in the general population we believe byetta continues to have a positive benefit risk profile for patients with type 2 diabetes

8265427 if we dont lift our game in this region and get this scheme up to practice we wont exist for too many more years into the future you cant have an irrigation scheme that leaks a third of its water
8265428 we could give up and leave i could leave now but thats not my game i want to leave something for the next generation
8265429 my thing is what are we going to do to ensure we have a future if it means a bit of flak in the meantime well so be it
8265430 melbourne is one of the major buyers of our products and they are short of water we need the money to finance us there is no way we as farmers could have financed whats being done here
8265431 when you stop somebody in the community and ask them what they think of wrestling we want them to say theyre the ones who are working with the kids or working really hard
8265432 for a lot of us myself included we need to be hands on with academics and the educational components have been a big help
8265433 weve always had this desire to do the best we can and typically thats been on the mat where we are academically we dont like how it looks right now were not where we believe we should be
8265434 under that scenario student athletes could actually become students before they become athletes
8265435 as a true freshman it can be tough youre used to being the toughest kid in the room and then you walk in and are getting beat up every day for a month its pretty significant making wrestling a one semester sport would alleviate some of that
8265436 officers have had reports of walk in burglaries at houses and camper vans in pondwell luccombe horringford and havenstreet
8265437 thefts have been taking place during the afternoon and early evening sometimes while residents have been at home
8265438 we believe whoever is responsible could be deliberately targeting isolated homes and premises away from the islands main towns
8265439 the agreement allows iraq to join security agreements with any other side other than the u s to preserve security in the country
8265440 the suggested agreement with the u s will not be long term but temporary and for only three years to organize the u s forces short term presence and withdrawal from iraq that is required to be completed by 2011
8265441 iraq will not hold any agreement or treaty on the basis of one foreign soldiers presence on the iraqi lands but through putting a specified timetable for the withdrawal of the foreign troops
8265442 big progress is currently taking place in the iraqi u s negotiations to put the final touches on the mutual agreement
8265443 among the pending points in the negotiations is the issue of offering unlimited immunities
8265444 open immunities cannot be given to any person whether he is iraqi or a foreigner
8265445 there is also the issue of foreign forces presence movements and bases
8265446 an agreement has been made that the end of 2011 would be the last date for foreign forces presence in iraq
8265447 meanwhile those forces are not allowed to conduct military missions unless with a clearance from the iraqi government
8265448 the agreement will be transparent and will be submitted to the iraqi parliament for approval
8265449 there will be no secrete appendixes for the agreement as some insincere politicians claim
8265450 very very close to finalizing the agreement but had not yet clinched the deal
8265451 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed

8265694 these findings refute the pervasive but unproven belief that these foods are associated with diverticular complications and suggest that the recommendation to avoid these foods in diverticular disease should be reconsidered
8265695 although the p for trends for the associations between increasing consumption of nuts and popcorn and the risk of diverticulitis were significant
8265696 the patterns of the hrs across consumption categories did not indicate dose response relationships

8265705 people always ask me whats your biggest criticism of george bush heres mine its not just policy differences its the fact that this president never tapped into our greatest resource the character and resolve of the american people
8265706 barack obama is a fine person but i dont think he is ready to be president i dont think he has the judgement which is developed through years of experience in life that prepares him for assuming the title of president
8265707 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8265708 i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8265709 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign into law a health plan that covers every single american
8265710 barack obama will end the war in iraq responsibly and bring our troops home a first step to repairing our alliances around the world
8265711 she did a great job with the right emphasis she highlighted the things she achieved in a way that did not diminish what obama has done i think she was gracious and i hope her supporters will take heed
8265712 were not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8265713 of course we dont need that everything depends on the stance of our partners and the world community and our partners in the west
8265714 russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the whole length of its border this is absolutely clear
8265715 we fear a war and we dont want one if its hot we dont want it
8265716 we will do everything we can to avoid a new cold war

8265730 rose wherever you went yesterday this name was pronounced with horror disbelief astonishment anger
8265731 yes anger this is perhaps the strongest emotion that every reasonable person is feeling today you dont have to be a parent to feel immense terrible anger which overcomes even the sense of helplessness frustration and compassion for such a small human being who lived among us an unhappy life fraught with suffering
8265732 they have no horns the look in their eyes is not terrifying no saliva drips from their mouths they do not curse photographers or attack journalists they are ordinary people who wear ordinary clothes

8265745 to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8265746 those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8265747 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8265748 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need

8265757 i was aware that brian was beginning to experiment with lsd and other psychedelics the prevailing drug jargon at the time had it that doses of lsd would shatter your ego as if that were a positive thing i wasnt interested in taking acid or getting rid of my ego
8265758 that really hurt him badly he couldnt understand it it was like why put your heart and soul into something
8265759 brian made us crawl around and snort like a bunch of pigs it was like being trapped in an insane asylum
8265760 the reasons that i didnt release smile one mike didnt like it
8265761 i know why charles manson did what he did someday ill tell the world ill write a book and explain why he did it over the years people have always wanted to know what happened what my relationship with charlie was we were just friends
8265762 he once told me i want you to discipline the kids ill do it wrong he backed out of it totally
8265763 i gotta get out of here this guys is nuts
8265764 a diseased bunch of motherfuckers if there ever was one their beauty is so awesome that listening to them at their best is like being in some vast dream cathedral decorated with a thousand gleaming american pop culture icons
8265765 one of the worst records ever made by a great rock band
8265766 we are not disbanding we know dennis would want us to continue in the spirit and tradition of the beach boys
8265767 almost everything on the record was programmed note for note sound for sound beat by beat and then we wouldnt hear it until we sent it through the computer the digital approach is so new and it can be quite tedious until you learn it
8265768 im a prisoner and i have no hope of escaping
8265769 id like to see mick jagger get out on the stage and do i get around versus jumpin jack flash any day now
8265770 i challenge the boss to get up onstage and jam
8265771 i guess mike didnt listen to the maharishi did he
8265772 my name is brian and im the man i write hit songs with the wave of my hand
8265773 i can do anything i want to now lets make some music
8265774 schizo affective disorder that presented itself in the form of disembodied voices
8265775 its scary i keep thinking im going to get assassinated like john lennon did i manage to get through my fears but sometimes i get these crazy notions that someone is going to kill me
8265776 if id had those guys in 67 i could have taken smile out on the road
8265777 i dont really ever want to put out the smile stuff its just not appropriate music
8265778 he still couldnt imagine hearing those sounds in the sanctified surroundings of a recording studio
8265779 the other beach boys didnt like smile they didnt want to do it but my new band is so much better they play better and they sing better too i have a much better time with them anyway
8265780 millions of dollars in illicit profits unfair competition and infringing use that shamelessly appropriated mike loves songs likeness and the beach boys trademark
8265781 the lawsuit against brian is meritless while he will vigorously defend himself he is deeply saddened that his cousin mike love has sunk to these depths for his own financial gain
8265782 to start a new tour if they werent stopped to do so by brians management and mikes incurable addiction to lawsuits
8265783 so thats just going to have to remain a mystery for all those dylanologists
8265784 my reflex action was to say thank you very much but no it had been so many years that id shut the door but the way he presented it was what was it like as a young girl to come from the family i came from and end up in the village and be in this place and observe it through my own eyes that was something to think about then my son said people have been writing a version of you for years its time you told the real one it suddenly made sense
8265785 when he started out as a performer he was playful a combination of woody guthrie and harpo marx with a good dose of himself as a binding ingredient
8265786 he used that playfulness to draw the audience in with the passing of time the technique was no longer required the audience was with him the minute he stepped on stage a sense of humour however was always his strong suit
8265787 right from the start i couldnt take my eyes off her
8265788 she was the most erotic thing id ever seen she was fair skinned and golden haired full blood italian we started talking and my head started to spin she was just my type
8265789 situations have ended sad relationships have all been bad mineve been like verlaines and rimbaud
8265790 i felt i was reading a book of revelations lessons warnings
8265791 even though picasso was a much older man than bob and had experienced a lot more their personalities were so similar that it was astounding
8265792 he sat still and quiet didnt even jiggle his leg
8265793 people ask was this song written for you well i could say this and that i could make a list but if you really listen to those songs theyre somewhat like fiction hes written something coming from his life but he sets it in a fiction maybe using another characters voice
8265794 i can recognise things its like looking at a diary it brings it all back and whats hard is that you remember being unsure of how life was going to go his mine anybodys so from the perspective of an older person looking back you enjoy them but also think of them as the pain of youth the loneliness and the struggle that youth is or may be
8265795 i could see that he was an artist at work
8265796 i was a young girl of my time i was shy and timid and i would be envious of men who could go to a cafe and sit and draw and read or write songs or do whatever they could do if a girl did that it would mean that she was alone she wasnt with somebody she was an easy woman it would take a lot of courage to do it and when you did it you took a chance
8265797 he had this intensity about him and you got sucked in
8265798 i certainly felt that as his girlfriend i disappeared and became a nonentity even if he didnt see me that way thats what happened that was always a struggle
8265799 there are people who say that he was not a good guy he was manipulative he was this that and the other i tend to see it as you are what you are he could be a shit like anybody else but a lot of it had to do with being given permission to say and do whatever you wanted because nobody was in a position to tell you no everybodys yessing you and everybody wants a piece of you so what do you do
8265800 and there are no residual hurt feelings i think shes an example of a woman who really knew what she wanted and how to get it and to everybody else the hell with you
8265801 which men could do easily she went out and got what she wanted and then he in turn did it for her and then he didnt that was him going after what he wanted with no baggage he never looked back he just kept going
8265802 it was the hardest thing to write about i was young and vulnerable and insecure there were pressures from all around and i couldnt find my place any more i didnt feel i had anybody i could turn to that makes you really fall apart and thats how i felt
8265803 only four people in new york know what that means he makes guitars
8265804 but its true so it doesnt go from page to page but the emotion that i managed to find is true

8265811 as the shadow of civil war lengthens across wesnoth a band of hardy marchlanders revolts against the tyranny of queen asheviere to win their way to freedom they must defeat not just the trained blades of wesnothian troops but darker foes including orcs and undead

8265841 our operations will often be less about killing the enemy than about making them irrelevant to the population
8265842 the role of conventional operations in this context is to keep the enemy at arms length while others undertake the capacity building essential to restarting societies
8265843 there was obviously evidence of sexual abuse that was not investigated by many people before the final episode
8265844 i started to wonder if a special procedure had not been performed if any of the professionals would have addressed the issue of sexual assault

8265849 most people i speak to think this two bridge solution is a mistake we prefer a one bridge option which means if the bridge has to be made wider and upgraded then that would be preferable

8266026 the sharp rise in the value of new projects announced is mainly due to major extensions to eskoms capacity expansion programme announced in this years national budget
8266027 for the year as a whole manufacturing may show a decline because a large number of projects were announced in the second half of last year
8266028 in contrast to the private and manufacturing sectors new projects announced by the mining sector dropped sharply off high levels as continued uncertainty over the future electricity supply possibly also contained expansion plans
8266029 while new capex plans by public corporations increased sharply this was entirely due to the revisions to eskoms capacity expansion programme
8266030 i tried to ignore him but my buttons were pushed finally i couldnt take it anymore i stormed out of the restaurant and told him to walk the few blocks home i got in the car and drove off

8266035 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8266036 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8266037 it is about time never in a lifetime did i think a friend would join the judging panel
8266038 i am either going to be a fabulous dinner guest or a disaster that is ushered out before the second course
8266039 always tried for a fourth judge because it followed the format of the original show pop idol we havent had much luck with that working but were gonna give it another try
8266040 ive been waiting for this i really have and people will love her shes great
8266041 always on time and when they would call action she always had a way of sparking
8266042 if people just get the opinion that shes cold or shes tough to work with it really wasnt like that i dont know how she was on previous projects or whatnot but i know for a fact that if there was any trouble on past projects with her she really did step up her game for this one she did a great job
8266043 greg the annoying office intern the pest in the office that nobody can stand
8266044 theres a particular scene where i offer myself to her i offer my help with the situation with what we all think shes going through so i kinda throw myself to her that people are really going to enjoy

8266047 i havent seen either of them in tights when i see both of them in tights then i can make my decision
8266048 it was something i wanted from day one on the show in america but it took us three seasons to persuade the network that it really was a crucial part of the format
8266049 the most important reason for doing it was it differentiated the audition process from american idol
8266050 and i thought the idea of a contestant having to win over the crowd as well as the judges just made it a more fun dramatic show to watch
8266051 for the audience they feel like theyre participating in the show
8266052 in tv land there is this saying viewers will watch anything that is timely topical or free

8266076 there is no history only fictions of various degrees of plausibility
8266077 if i lie and say you took me for a friend patched together in my thin bones will you help me be cunning and noisy as the wind

8266087 robert borks america is a land in which women would be forced into back alley abortions blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters rogue police could break down citizens doors in midnight raids school children could not be taught about evolution writers and artists would be censored at the whim of government and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens
8266088 would oppose the nomination and would lead the fight in the senate
8266089 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
8266090 how far are you willing to take that step into what i consider the abyss of violence and we really never did except for that moment in the townhouse i actually think destroying property in the face of that kind of catastrophe is so restrained and i dont see it as a big deal

8266331 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8266332 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8266333 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8266334 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8266335 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

8266346 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

8266353 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8266354 i also have far too much respect for the people of manchester and england to criticise them in this way

8266409 richard foster is doing a good job at right back and the defence looks fairly solid but i can understand jimmy being keen to bring in alan
8266410 it would allow richard to play elsewhere whereas alan is a natural right back who knows the game and his job
8266411 i think it would be better if the player shows a bit of commitment
8266412 i can understand him wanting to wait until the last minute to get the best deal he can but it would mean so much more to jimmy if he would come out and say he enjoyed it here last season and he wanted to come back and do his bit for aberdeen
8266413 if would be good to see that attitude because things might happen with other players who are showing commitment
8266414 things have dragged on and jimmy does not like that alan must know what he is doing so it is up to him but i would not push jimmy too far

8266428 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
8266429 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
8266430 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
8266431 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
8266432 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
8266433 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
8266434 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
8266435 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

8266473 all you have to do is tell her you love her
8266474 shellie you can leave a dollar in your bank account to keep it from being closed with an investment you take big risks to get big returns
8266475 love is patient and kind love is not jealous it does not brag and it i s not proud love is not rude is not selfish and does not get upset with others love does not count up wrongs that have been done love takes no pleasure in evil but rejoices over the truth love patiently accepts all things it always trusts always hopes and always endures
8266476 part of the reason that men seem so much less loving than women is that mens behavior is measured with a feminine ruler

8266485 we are grateful to the washington post the new york times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years but the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government the supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries
8266486 in times of change the patriot is a scarce man brave hated and scorned when his cause succeeds however the timid join him for then it costs nothing to be a patriot
8266487 the important thing is not to stop questioning curiosity has its own reason for existing

8266490 we must speak the truth about terror let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of september the 11th malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves away from the guilty
8266491 i care about whats true i care about evidence i care about evidence as the reason for knowing what is true it is true that i come across rather passionate sometimes and thats because i am passionate about the truth
8266492 the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and all science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead his eyes are closed

8266494 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8266495 recently went to georgia where he met quietly with the president and came back with a call for aid and a tough message for russia
8266496 to the extent that public consensus has settled on the notion that the war was wrong but the surge was right biden will be the one and only candidate among the final four wholl have voted wrong on both
8266497 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders
8266498 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
8266499 but joe biden is barely listening anymore hes already moved on to something else
8266500 if you have friends coming from far away you must be very happy
8266501 if there is a heaven or a hell i thought its right here on earth we dont have to die to enter one or the other
8266502 this is all a well rehearsed play with the outcome predetermined
8266503 i will continue it so that all those who are part of this conspiracy can face me and have me lay heavy on their consciences
8266504 i was just thinking of how small we are under the stars
8266505 nina jackson used to tell me there were far more devils and that was why we needed all the powders and the chants the bones and good luck charms even grandmere catherine gazed into the darkness with the belief that evil lurked in every shadow and she had to be vigilant and prepared to do battle was that my fate too to always do battle
8266506 oh i repeated once cause we were a new school and they didnt have year three yet and then i repeated again cause i couldnt find half my arc worksheets and couldnt blardy file them
8266507 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8266508 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8266509 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8266510 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8266511 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8266512 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8266513 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
8266514 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighbourhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighbourhood in that cell

8266535 mmogs dont half make it difficult to team up with people sometimes you get chatting to someone and find out hey you both play battlefield 2142 pick the same server log on and you can be throwing yourselves into combat against the hated enemy or indeed each other in minutes find out you both play world of warcraft and wouldnt it be crazy fun to adventure together great except theyre probably on a us server while youre on an eu server and if you happen to be on the same continent youre probably on a different server within that continent and if you happen to be on the same server youre probably different factions and if you happen to be on the same server and the same faction youre probably different levels and if you happen to be on the same server and the same faction and youre the same level theyre probably only interested in heroic dungeon runs in places you cant get to or theyre the same class as you so you fight over all the loot drops or they turn out to be an insane stalker you really wish youd never teamed with in the first place though i dont think we can blame that one on game design

8266557 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8266558 we recruited 47 subjects to participate in the study half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8266559 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8266560 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8266561 the principal advantage is persistence that you would be there all the time
8266562 a satellite goes over the same part of the earth twice a day and one of those is at night so its only really getting a snapshot of activity zephyr would be watching all day

8266565 well you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
8266566 was just plain evasive obviously seeking to play down his extremist view that abortion at any time in any circumstance is perfectly acceptable to him
8266567 above my pay grade is the government military version of thats not my job im sorry my enlighten sic progressive friends but when you are getting ready to try to run the free world there is nothing above your pay grade if there is then you are not the leader so send us the person for whom answering tough questions is within their pay grade
8266568 we must unite as a nation to put a stop to abortion
8266569 under no circumstances are we going to execute or imprison women who have abortions or the doctors who perform them in the united states of america
8266570 no matter what happened two guys are dead and the families are still hurting
8266571 we want to tell them that we appreciate what they did for us

8266582 go out go out and dance if you really dont hate me for this separation go out and dance one of the men will see you dance well he will like your dancing he will marry you who knows but that with him you will be luckier than you were with me
8266583 you know very well that i wont want any other woman either you know that dont you lumnay you know it dont you
8266584 you cannot blame me i have been a good husband to you
8266585 no you have been very good to me you have been a good wife i have nothing to say against you
8266586 its only that a man must have a child seven harvests is just too long to wait yes we have waited too long we should have another chance before it is too late for both of us
8266587 i have prayed to kabunyan much i have sacrificed many chickens in my prayers
8266588 you remember how angry you were once when you came home from your work in the terrace because i butchered one of our pigs without your permission i did it to appease kabunyan because like you i wanted to have a child but what could i do
8266589 kabunyan does not see fit for us to have a child
8266590 because i did not find you among the dancers of course i am not forcing you to come if you dont want to join my wedding ceremony i came to tell you that madulimay although i am marrying her can never become as good as you are she is not as strong in planting beans not as fast in cleaning water jars not as good keeping a house clean you are one of the best wives in the whole village
8266591 i built it for you make it your own live in it as long as you wish i will build another house for madulimay
8266592 ill go to my own house my parents are old they will need help in the planting of the beans in the pounding of the rice
8266593 i will give you the field that i dug out of the mountains during the first year of our marriage
8266594 you know i did it for you you helped me to make it for the two of us
8266595 it is not right for you to be here they will wonder where you are and madulimay will not feel good go back to the dance
8266596 i would feel better if you could come and dance for the last time the gangsas are playing
8266597 lumnay if i did this it is because of my need for a child you know that life is not worth living without a child the man have mocked me behind my back you know that
8266598 i will pray that kabunyan will bless you and madulimay
8266599 look at my body then it was full of promise it could dance it could work fast in the fields it could climb the mountains fast even now it is firm full but awiyao i am useless i must die
8266600 i dont care about the house i dont care for anything but you ill have no other man
8266601 if you die it means you hate me you do not want me to have a child you do not want my name to live on in our tribe
8266602 it means ill die nobody will get the fields i have carved out of the mountains nobody will come after me
8266603 ill come back to you then both of us will die together both of us will vanish from the life of our tribe
8266604 you will keep the beads they come from far off times my grandmother said they come from up north from the slant eyed people across the sea you keep them lumnay they are worth twenty fields
8266605 ill keep them because they stand for the love you have for me
8266606 i love you i love you and have nothing to give
8266607 awiyao awiyao o awiyao they are looking for you at the dance
8266608 not until you tell me that it is all right with you
8266609 how does she know how can anybody know it is not right
8266610 i was concerned for my city and i was worried about the future and i was mad that my nations government was sitting on its hands
8266611 in the united states we view ourselves as a great nation a principled people with a history of rising to the challenge of the most serious international threats
8266612 yet there we were responsible for 25 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions causing a global meltdown but somehow incapable of doing anything about it
8266613 our publicly owned electric utility city light is the first in the nation to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions through a combination of renewable energy sources and carbon offsets essentially paying others to reduce their pollution
8266614 it is a source of great pride we are powering our city without toasting the planet
8266615 the fact that mayors have really embraced it is a strong signal to the country that this is a very important issue
8266616 mayors do this for their cities not as window dressing but to prove that their cities are well managed
8266617 if all the nations of the world lived up to the kyoto protocol the effect on global warming would be undetectable for a century so the effect of a few cities within the united states living up to kyoto would be less than undetectable

8266630 gunshot residue tests are done in almost every case where a shooting has taken place
8266631 the main focus of our research is to develop a method that will help credibility of gunshot residue evidence in court you can get results with this test in 30 to 40 minutes with the new test in addition you only need small amounts of evidence to run the test
8266632 when a gun fires the gunpowder explodes producing gases at enormous pressure that propels the bullet out of the barrel of the firearm
8266633 some of the residue from that explosion is deposited on the hands of the shooter and the clothing of the victim
8266634 when you have a residue particle no matter how small its going to contain signatures of every element in that powder
8266635 you would just look for the one little piece of metal that might be there so the analysis could take hours
8266636 if youre looking for powder however theres a lot more of it youre getting more of the residue to analyze it makes it a much more efficient method of detection
8266637 many chemical cleaners anything that can be used to take off motor oil or freight dust will test positive for gunshot residue using the griess test
8266638 the worst thing you can possibly say is theres a chance im wrong our preliminary results indicate you can determine the presence of gunshot residue with a high level of confidence
8266639 most fertilizer products used today were developed when energy seemed abundant and cheap but with rising prices we should develop a new generation of fertilizer products that use plant nutrients more efficiently
8266640 such innovations will require investments in research but such costs would be miniscule compared to the benefits for humanity
8266641 i am concerned about the state of the fertilizer industry itself
8266642 work should begin now on the next generation of fertilizer products using advanced techniques such as nanotechnology and molecular biology especially in conjunction with plant genetics research smart fertilizer products that will release nutrients only at the time and in the amount needed should be developed
8266643 the world needs a major research effort to improve the effectiveness of fertilizer production and use
8266644 fertilizer is a commodity industry and it is unlikely the industry alone will undertake the research some public investment is probably required

8266703 everyone is focusing on japan as the big team in the group but i know uzbekistan from before they were the first team to qualify for this third round so there is no reason to underestimate them
8266704 i have been there tashkent before so i know what to expect for me there is not a big surprise they play a russian style of football physically strong skilful with good organisation and the fans will be very fanatic so it will be a hectic evening for our boys
8266705 it is an interesting challenge a tough game and it can help qualification if we can get a good result over there it wont be easy but we have a good preparation coming up so i am happy

8266710 the last person you should leave alone in front of goal is madjer that said he was 30 metres out and not facing goal
8266711 in my opinion donald bradman was woods and nicklaus combined and more hes spitz and phelps and more as far as im concerned hes simply the greatest sportsman the world has ever seen
8266712 cricket is australias favourite game im honoured to be able to turn my passion for the game into a professional career i personally look forward to emulating sir donald in leaving the game in better shape for having been a part of it
8266713 he thought his ability was absolutely second to none and that his modesty and integrity of the very highest order
8266714 there is a lot of issues that cricket faces at the moment not just the twenty20 not just the ipl
8266715 i believe they india account for about 80 of world cricket revenue its a reasonably strong position to be in one would think as a business so how do they how does the icc international cricket council and the cricket world manage that not deal with it but manage it because its real and its happening and fair play to them theres immense passion for the game there and a great love for it
8266716 twenty20 cricket will it ruin test cricket i dont think so i really do think that the basic fundamentals of the game are still the same
8266717 we survived world series cricket 30 years ago it is a game that does have the ability to mutate to come in different forms short long energetic or some may say slow boring relaxing whatever your take is it does have the ability to evolve and turn itself around
8266718 it was probably the highlight of my career to go out on the field with that great man

8266721 well sit down at the end of the season at the appropriate time to talk about our list
8266722 some players have stepped up this year in that role and its marvellous that opportunities have been created and players have grabbed that
8266723 his words were that once the decision was made it made him feel a lot better i think he was edgy about the way his leg was reacting to the workload and then not knowing what was happening i think it was just the unknown
8266724 hes going to be helping leon cameron with the midfield working with the younger midfielders and certainly at stoppages as well because thats his forte
8266725 its a bit of a blow but people are making more of a kid whos 20 years of age and has played 19 games i think it would have helped our structure but having said that hes only played seven or eight games this year and weve coped ok

8266729 adesso penso che ci si muover nella logica di provare a trovare una soluzione che riporti il calcio in chiaro aspettiamo 48 ore marted c stata una decisione dellassemblea ma da oggi si riparte tutti nellambito dei propri ruoli nella speranza che si trovi una soluzione positiva penso che sia un problema di cui tutti hanno la consapevolezza che va risolto
8266730 c laccordo con il monaco e c con il giocatore lufficialit per potrebbe non arrivare oggi ma domani menez contentissimo lo hanno richiesto anche da altri grandi club europei che per non posso rivelare
8266731 taylor did not break jail taylor was let out with the purpose of coming to liberia to help us move a dictatorial regime
8266732 when we got there burkina faso we were told that we were going to be arrested if we did not comply to remove thomas sankara from office because he was not in favour of our plan we were asked to join a special group of burkinabe soldiers to overthrow sankara that was how thomas sankara was removed
8266733 ive been single for a fair while i suppose when ive been down to the pub ive been there with my three brothers so im pretty oblivious to the men
8266734 im a sociable little munchkin so ill talk to anyone i havent really been looking too hard i suppose
8266735 just feel good about yourself women love being around charismatic people
8266736 we had an agreement to have a somewhat open relationship and actually being involved in a game online was a very safe way to do that
8266737 we have taught him certain things but other things like music he picks up he just likes to imitate what he hears
8266738 we listen to radio 4 a lot and he always joins in the pips before the news he also copies noises before you even realise you are doing them
8266739 my nephew had got the gravelly voice down to a tee and now leonard can do it too
8266740 he also whistles dock of the bay the theme tune from mission impossible renditions of red red wine ymca and perfect impressions of water splashing and a squeak in the floorboards
8266741 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8266742 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8266743 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day
8266744 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate
8266745 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8266746 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on
8266747 but there hasnt been any formal communication from sadc from president mbeki to say this is the way forward
8266748 we are actually looking forward to the conclusion of the dialogue when mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai form a transitional government
8266749 police can legitimately use a minimum of force if they resist or are armed
8266750 i ask protesters of the pad to please withdraw from the government house compound immediately you can rally somewhere else
8266751 if you want to arrest us come here and arrest us here it is the government who must go
8266752 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8266753 they have broken the law and it could be a serious setback for them
8266754 the government has a lot of options they have time on their side
8266755 we found the abducted japanese man he had been shot several times
8266756 we started a massive search operation to rescue but unfortunately the abductors killed him
8266757 police closed the circle on abductors that is why they left him there bleeding
8266758 it is possible that children born by caesarean section differ from other children with respect to some unknown characteristic which consequently increases their risk of diabetes but it is also possible that caesarean section itself is responsible

8266768 the speech was too good it just proves that she should have been the presidential vice presidential nominee
8266769 the quality of her speech should be leaving dems scratching their heads as they wonder why she isnt on the ticket
8266770 an exaggeration is a truth that has lost its temper
8266771 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8266772 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again
8266773 the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20 degrees and it rains rains rains
8266774 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather
8266775 in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8266776 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
8266777 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8266778 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8266779 the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time of all
8266780 it was much easier for me to adapt to russia than england in england i had no one to talk to
8266781 the first month was especially hard i lived alone in a hotel which i left only for training i thought i would go crazy inside those four walls
8266782 paul ince made a holding midfielder a priority almost from day one and were delighted to have finally signed vince
8266783 i think english football at the moment has taken over its improved so much
8266784 its full of world champions and its something that having been ten years in italy interests me
8266785 me going to chelsea im staying as a rossoneri player
8266786 i should help milan to win the trophies were up for this season the club have made some great signings and sheva will fit in without any problems
8266787 i cant say if ive been included in the shevchenko deal because if someone has promised me to chelsea owner roman abramovich it wasnt me
8266788 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8266789 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan
8266790 robinhos time in spain has come to an end and he is looking forward to being part of a new project
8266791 i highly respect the club the players and especially the fans whove always treated me well but thats not my objective
8266792 i have an offer which is good for me and the club i dream of playing in the english league chelsea have a great squad and a great team
8266793 my objective is to play there ive got nothing against real madrid but i hope to resolve this situation as soon as possible
8266794 its not about money i simply want to leave i want to be the best player in the world and that isnt possible at real madrid
8266795 ive come to an end of a cycle ive played three seasons at real madrid ive given my all i think that my time here has now come to an end
8266796 we really just wanted to reflect on how much our hometown means to us how it sculpted us and even beyond the band how long weve all been together
8266797 we wanted every track on the record to be the strongest it could be
8266798 were standing up for her because clintons too much of a class act to not support obama
8266799 because i can say to you tonight positively that john mccain is right he doesnt understand the economy as well as he should and he doesnt understand how the policies he has supported and wants to perpetuate have so terribly misfired
8266800 even if you drilled in all of john mccains back yards even the ones he doesnt know about

8266804 this is the next to last step in a systematic succession plan weve had in place for some time now
8266805 but its still an announcement that comes with a lot of mixed emotions when you consider the integral role that bb amp t has played in my life for nearly 40 years now
8266806 vi faldt sammen som kollektiv f r pausen og rejste os som hold efter pausen dog uden at det var prangende p nogen m de
8266807 if i ever hear ian healy or someone say sledging has been going on forever im going to refer him to the video of the invincibles there wasnt a word out of place for the whole tour
8266808 if bradman could come back today and see whats happening in the game of cricket i think hed be terribly disappointed
8266809 when i heard about ricky ponting delivering the bradman oration i thought to myself dear oh dear oh well thats the way they do things these days
8266810 he dominated cricket for 20 years from his debut in 1928 to his retirement 60 years ago this month and if he had not lost eight years of his career to world war ii his figures would no doubt be better still at every olympics plenty of records are broken bradman remains unassailable
8266811 as a team we do try and score at least 300 runs a day in test cricket
8266812 in honour of bradmans legacy thats the least we can do
8266813 his name is a by word for brilliance soccer has pele cricket has bradman no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8266814 even people with just a passing knowledge of the game or in countries where he never played will invariably recognise the name bradman as a by word for brilliance that name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket soccer has pele and cricket has bradman
8266815 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level
8266816 we should also remember the way he gave back to the game after he finished playing as a selector and as an administrator with the australian cricket board and the imperial cricket conference
8266817 all we need is for mikey s to manage the offense get the ball to the play makers like espy or larry kendrick that guy is a stud
8266818 its a wonderful surprise although it is only one time funding clearly the provincial government is listening and doing what they can to assist
8266819 we have not made any decisions staff will assess and bring a report to council
8266820 as one of the fastest growing communities in the province our infrastructure needs are significant this investment will benefit residents and stimulate the economy in all three municipalities in peel brampton caledon and mississauga its very good news that peel will be able to set its own priorities for applying these funds ambulance and paramedic services social housing and roads are all top items on our list
8266821 the big boost to infrastructure reflects last years strong economic performance
8266822 the economic challenges were facing this year mean i can safely predict i wont make this kind of announcement 12 months from now
8266823 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store

8266827 go for a long walk or a run on the track
8266828 whip out my tv on dvd review of the week nick jr all about fall
8266829 i told my fellow soldiers about him and when i heard he was running for president it was a no brainer i became a citizen so i could vote
8266830 a candidate if he or she is good enough can be taken seriously regardless of race
8266831 thats why people like me can think about running for governor of alabama now
8266832 it takes organization it takes money it takes contacts it takes people vouching for you
8266833 its more complicated for anyone regardless of race but i think that its more difficult if youre african american hispanic or a woman
8266834 but it takes a lot of work to put together a statewide organization
8266835 you cant just take barack obama and say were going to have more african american u s senators more governors it just doesnt play out that way
8266836 2004 there would be about six black senators and five black governors
8266837 a signal event which will change how people think about race and politics
8266838 didnt really build a grass roots organization beyond their base
8266839 when the universe expands they cant win by being the black candidate or being the victim
8266840 if your politics depends on being a spokesman for an ethnic community by definition you wont have the ability to speak to a larger community
8266841 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
8266842 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
8266843 we hope to make torchwood a gripping and surprising tv event with storylines that push our team into greater danger and sacrifice
8266844 this honestly is the first time ive ever been asked that question im getting married and having children today
8266845 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot
8266846 support peace and stability in abkhazia and in the republics territorial waters
8266847 clear commitment from the eu that it will continue to stand by georgia and the same applies for our membership of nato
8266848 if they europe want relations to worsen they will get it
8266849 a couple of days ago just a handful of districts were affected and today there are 15 which are under water
8266850 the government is asking us to escape but we have nowhere to go
8266851 the two hijackers and the seven crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8266852 the night was terrifying and difficult i thank the libyan authorities for their efforts which allowed us to be freed
8266853 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian aeroplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport
8266854 we dont have any relation with that hijacking civilians theyre angry theyll behave like that they may agree with abdul wahid but in our structure we have no decision like this to hijack a civilian airplane
8266855 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8266856 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense
8266857 its not going to take very long for it to be a total massacre
8266858 which risk is more likely that someone is going to accidentally set off a gun in class and god forbid hit a student or someone will come in off the highway and start a random shooting spree
8266859 thats the place people could go if they are feeling crazy or mad at the world and get a big body count
8266860 most high school seniors been huntin on their own since the age of 12

8266863 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8266864 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8266865 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8266866 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8266867 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8266868 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8266869 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8266870 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8266871 standing on that stage tonight in front of 20 000 democrats unified behind senator obama i saw a bright future for america
8266872 i saw millions of people across the country working as one to elect the next democratic president
8266873 victoria is a rare kind of actress shes beautiful yet takes a fearless approach to acting
8266874 kids loved her on zoey 101 because she could boldly take a pie in the face or just as easily tackle a dramatic scene it is this versatility combined with her musical talent and real girl qualities that make her someone we are excited about
8266875 i dont have a church that im the pastor of so in my mind im a very untraditional reverend and my pulpit just happens to be mtv which is a very different type of congregation

8266909 for us as a database vendor delphi 2009 is the most important new release since delphi 3
8266910 the full unicode support and the numerous changes to the data access layers put delphi 2009 at the top in terms of rapid application development for anyone serious about internationally deployed database applications delphi 2009 is an absolute must

8266917 we found out how useful the unit was about two hours after we put it in service our hazmat teams got called out for an incident and we were on scene with the field comm unit before our crews even got there
8266918 this unit is unique in the fact that the vehicle was built around the communications not the communications around the vehicle its practical in a matter of five minutes we have communications
8266919 e one recognized the crucial need for cross agency communication and the need for first responders to be fully connected in all emergency and disaster situations
8266920 together e one and ics now offer technologies which allow first responders to reach back into their infrastructures to improve response times and resource allocations making departments more productive and saving lives
8266921 the field comm unit has given our department a greater connectivity with multiple disciplines in the city of charlotte and surrounding areas
8266922 upon arrival at the scene of an event it instantly creates a communications bridge that enables the communications between all responders on scene and simultaneously enables the passing of real time information to our emergency operation center allowing us to make quicker strategic decisions
8266923 the charlotte fire department has emerged as a leader in emergency communications for first responders they required a mobile solution that would allow them to provide the critical communications that are necessary at any incident scene whether that be a working fire a missing person search or something as large as an area devastated by a hurricane

8266927 menos probable que la regi n vuelva a padecer crisis financieras como las acaecidas durante las ltimas dos d cadas
8266928 el agravamiento de la crisis se ha ido traduciendo en un cierto empeoramiento de las condiciones de financiaci n un menor volumen de emisiones de deuda aumentos del riesgo pa s y una correcci n a la baja de los mercados burs tiles

8266933 the appolo mine is an excellent example of the type of asset that homeland plans to focus on for future acquisition
8266934 the growth profile for these assets both in terms of operations and in terms of sales is going to assist in the significant movement of homeland toward the mid tier of international coal companies
8266935 we have been very impressed with the production rates and operations of the appolo mine appolos operations environmental and management track records are enviable and fit well with homelands corporate mandate for safe clean efficient and profitable operations
8266936 based upon the current margins at appolo we believe that debt financing the acquisition is the most appropriate option to pursue and well within the means and capabilities of the company

8266950 i think that to get good information you need a little contention
8266951 they see how nice the town looks and they want to lock the door and not let anyone else in
8266952 the board will be objective in meeting the needs of both the old and new residents as this town belongs to everyone that calls ancram their home
8266953 there are still several tasks to which i would have liked to contribute
8266954 the momentum process and protocol that have evolved almost assuredly do not seem to embrace those challenges

8266973 a vote is like a rifle its usefulness depends upon the character of the user
8266974 this attack will not keep us from carrying out our duties to help bring about stability and peaceful development in afghanistan
8266975 if you had talked to me at the end of last year or when i got the head coaching job i would have said that we hope to be in the mix but i think were going to be a good hockey club im not a big believer that younger is not always good weve got a lot of kids that want to play and not just play but get to the next level
8266976 learning how to win is about the toughest thing in hockey
8266977 having kids like that who have a taste of winning its so important
8266978 matt duff is a leader lyndon procter is a leader along with cody lefrancois and steve pearson in order to have a good program the leadership torch has to be passed and i think those guys are ready for a lead role
8266979 hopefully i can set a good example right from the start
8266980 im just making sure im ready making sure my games at the best that it can be
8266981 were going to have three teams at camp and its going to be an unbelievable camp as far as vying for positions
8266982 i think last time i worried about winning right away and put a lot of pressure on not only myself but also the hockey club to win and peaking a little bit early
8266983 now ill put the horse before the cart and look to get better every day
8266984 the lifeline of our team is with our season tickets and with our sponsorship and also with out billets
8266985 that ensures the success of our hockey club and makes sure it stays a strong team for a long time to come
8266986 un gran esfuerzo pero que ha valido la pena por un jugador tan importante
8266987 ya dije que mi equipo es el villarreal y sta es mi casa
8266988 el club me tiene en gran estima y cuando me lo han vuelto a demostrar con esa claridad eso es lo m s grande para un futbolista y por eso he decidido no pensar en nada m s que seguir aqu este club es el que me ha abierto las puertas siempre y espero devolverle su apoyo en el campo
8266989 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
8266990 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
8266991 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
8266992 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
8266993 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
8266994 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
8266995 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
8266996 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
8266997 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
8266998 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
8266999 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
8267000 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
8267001 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
8267002 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
8267003 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
8267004 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people
8267005 be the change that you want to see in the world
8267006 i think it was a terrific deal for them i think it puts the raptors into a different situation they had great momentum after their season two years ago but they were marred by injuries this year and never seemed to get a rhythm i like the fact that oneal because of his talent is coming off of a situation where he has something to prove and when you catch a player on a rebound like that thats good timing
8267007 if you look at the play offs and the way they fell off against orlando they needed more scoring you need somebody down there whos going to give you an additional scoring threat to take the pressure off of chris bosh i think jermaine oneal probably has three good years left and something to prove theres a bigger problem in toronto about what the hell is going to happen to andrea bargnani as a top pick hes a one dimensional player and hes not doing that one dimension well i know what protocol is in situations like this but im looking at management to do whats best for the team if bargnani doesnt do anything this year they got to get rid of him
8267008 selbst das rekordniveau von 2007 konnten wir in diesem jahr konstant halten

8267013 to wake up this hall after a speech that was not only not red meat by former governor warner but more like tofu with sprouts
8267014 if he thought the democrats were hitting john mccain hard enough
8267015 we expected a lot of red meat from senator clinton tonight are you surprised she didnt sort of attack him more vociferously

8267057 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8267058 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8267059 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8267062 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are
8267063 murray bail plays a laconic self concealing game cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories the pages is not an easy or open book but it is an oddly compelling one the spell is most powerfully cast in which can make the world come alive on the page after all perhaps it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for to grasp what he saw before him ordinary objects to fit words only to what can be seen

8267078 while obama has campaigned on a pledge to end the iraq war an examination of his top foreign policy advisers is raising concern amongst some in the antiwar movement
8267079 among the old guard clinton era players on obamas foreign policy team are former secretaries of state madeleine albright and warren christopher former national security adviser tony lake former defense secretary william perry former supreme allied commander of nato general wesley clark and former assistant secretary of state susan rice not to mention joe biden who was the chair of the powerful senate foreign relations committee when the bush administration was pushing to invade iraq
8267080 well i still oppose them members of the party who where key advisors during bill clintons presidency and backed the war in iraq but im going to work to get barack obama elected because we have to take a new direction
8267081 be certain that under a democratic administration if that administration is showing aggressive tendencies or is putting us on the edge of a war again or not taking us into a direction of peace i am not going to be quiet i mean im going to continue to talk about the direction america should go in but we cant let those differences that we have right now cause us to fracture at a time that we really have to bring a change to the white house

8267087 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8267088 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8267089 i repeat that it is very dangerous and there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova

8267125 upon completion planned parenthoods building will house a surgical ambulatory center where children will be aborted through 25 weeks of pregnancy no questions asked
8267126 this mega abortion center is just right down the street from the main campus of the university of houston and not very far from rice university and texas state university so a lot of kids from out of state go to school here
8267127 in fact we have a website texasfamilies org and on the front page we have a statement where you can add your name
8267128 the statement says you oppose planned parenthoods expansion here in houston
8267129 not a xenophobic party not an intolerant party we are a compassionate party that follows the rule of law and endorses federal law
8267130 what we have here is an initiated act that says that adoptive or foster care children in arkansas will not be placed in homes where there is a live in boyfriend or live in girlfriend
8267131 it simply says if youre cohabitating with a sexual partner out of wedlock then you are not allowed to adopt a child or be a foster parent in the state of arkansas
8267132 for that measure we were able to garner 75 percent of the vote here in the state of arkansas to say that marriage is the union of a man and a woman

8267143 older people especially those who rely on retirement income are some of the worst affected furthermore people relying on the basic state pension which will only rise in line with government inflation figures may feel the pinch even more inflation is sometimes called the hidden risk because it quietly chips away at the buying power of the pound in our pockets but its hard to disguise a chip when it becomes a chunk
8267144 for one in five people the buying power of the pound in their pockets is being eroded at over twice this rate
8267145 the over 55s are facing enormous change in their lives and many may be apprehensive about their retirement
8267146 its great news that many people can look forward to financial and social freedom in later life but of course the more money they have coming in from pensions and savings the more enjoyable retirement will be
8267147 this is yet another example of a seemingly trusted organisation appearing to be sloppy with peoples personal information people are entitled to wonder why they are constantly being told about the importance of protecting personal information when large organisations dont seem to follow the same rules themselves

8267151 id say were reaching a point where the need for greater student housing is pressing
8267152 which we take as a good sign in terms of how popular our residence halls are
8267153 a lot of students prefer to live off campus no matter what you do on campus
8267154 i think we all sort of informally agreed lets just keep working and not worry about doing agreement after agreement
8267155 they were saying their debt ratio was maxed out so they couldnt create any more student housing
8267156 in a way it was more effective because if you create more student housing then you have to hope and pray that students actually move into it
8267157 the third party box isnt something ive ever been comfortable with
8267158 im not obsessed with the concept of a third party per se

8267162 tempting to try to get elected any way you can
8267163 anything we can do to break the grip of the two party system is a good thing its a plus for democracy
8267164 there are people on the far left and some who are very moderate so tims is a voice to be heard from one wing of the party
8267165 what looks to be a progressive move to hijack the democratic party

8267186 kelly was in a right state she had blood pouring out of a lump in her head while black and blue swelling started almost straight away around her eyes its a nasty cut and she was shook up at first but luke made sure she was ok

8267196 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse mr mugabe told the lunch
8267197 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day mr mugabe said
8267198 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate mdc spokesman nelson chamisa said
8267199 hijack the leadership of zimbabwe and said the veteran leader was trying to ride roughshod over his political opponents
8267200 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8267201 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on mr chamisa said
8267202 but there hasnt been any formal communication from sadc from president mbeki to say this is the way forward

8267210 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8267211 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8267212 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8267213 it must be a priority that we sit down to thoroughly discuss the subject of the electrical crisis because the solution isnt as simple as buying power generation barges
8267214 will perhaps improve the problem a little but the solution to the electrical subject is a very complex and is solved neither in the short term nor with simple measures

8267271 we want to make sure that patients are getting the best of care that they are going to places that we know have low infection rates serious infections can lead to death
8267272 it could lead to discrimination against patients who may be at higher risk of infection or are not as cheap to look after
8267273 a hospital could score very highly if it only takes comparatively healthy people for cheap and easy procedures and refuses to take infected or infection prone patients
8267274 we are walking away from the concept of universal health care and choice hospitals should be measuring these statistics indeed they already do and they use them to put better systems in place but using benchmarks to manage care thats what the ama is fearful of

8267295 it makes me more proud im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk but when its calvin klein and its fashion photographer steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it

8267354 they have both promised to look into the sufferings of the burmese people and find a solution to the crisis but till date there is no solid evidence that the promise has been kept or put into practice
8267355 i believe that she aung san suu kyi is on hunger strike i think it is the right time to remind them un and asean general secretaries that they must abide to their promise
8267356 we want a more serious action perhaps the un secretary general should appoint somebody else
8267357 i think it is about time that we find someone who is more capable

8267371 in the near future i hope gaming journalists will ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
8267372 what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself
8267373 wouldnt be in leipzig today or at this game convention
8267374 we can only draw conclusions from the pattern of the behaviour of the police service over the years and then particularly during this registration exercise and it seems to be pointing in that direction that somehow the police service or some of them have decided to work as the security arm of the ruling npp rather than protecting the whole citizenry
8267375 all seem to be in a pattern that suggests that the police are not out to play a fair game as far as this elections are concerned
8267376 we all know the stories that were coming from the ashanti region npps attempt to bus people from other parts of the country to go and register and some of the ndc people resisting it and it came to a point where the regional police command organized police escort for the busses to go to sekyedumasi to go and register
8267377 ive just been informed that last night some unidentified police personnel went and broke into the houses of some ndc people at ejura sekyedumasi and effected their arrest when the regional commander was contacted this morning he claimed that he was not aware of the action before it took place however once it has taken place he is going to work on it and ensure that those people are released
8267378 now you go to the volta region about four days ago or so there was also another case like that where the regional commander derry instructed a district commander to effect certain arrests of ndc supporters the district commander said he does not have any evidence of the commission of any crime by anybody so he couldnt undertake that arrest and then the regional commander had to move with troops to ho to go and effect arrest of ndc supporters

8267382 it is very disturbing for the members of the ndc to mock some of us because they have not seen any change in our lives even though our party is in power
8267383 this is a political issue and i dont want to get myself involved the assembly member of chapel hill wants to put me in trouble so go and talk to him
8267384 go and speak to kwesi nkrumah why he vetoed the subject matter when it had not been exhausted
8267385 muslims are now convinced that it is only the danquah busia dombo tradition represented by the npp that has high recognition for the islamic religion
8267386 in the name of allah the gracious and merciful nana addo would win one touch
8267387 a muslim and a true zongo boy would be the npp presidential running mate
8267388 this is a manifestation of the ndcs discrimination against muslims
8267389 because there is no sea in the whole of the ashanti region president kufuor does not see the need to pay attention to the plight of fishermen whose activities are being destroyed by the activities of pair trawlers and soaring prices of premix fuel
8267390 he has even worsened the situation by establishing the countrys finest cold stores in his home region where no fishing activity goes on instead of the coastal communities
8267391 we have not been docile when the ndc was in power we had the advantage of press coverage but since it went into opposition nobody is interested in our project and nobody carries it
8267392 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8267393 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8267394 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8267395 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8267396 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs
8267397 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system
8267398 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8267399 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8267400 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication
8267401 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation
8267402 we are proud to mark the ten year anniversary of harvest moon with the launch of harvest moon island of happiness on the nintendo ds

8267406 this year will again be a bumper show for our exhibitors and visitors six halls halls 5 to 10 plus an outside area which total 34 000 square meters are completely sold out and we have more exhibitors and brands as well as more local companies than in previous years visitors will be able to feast on solutions and services from electrical engineering and software packages for production optimisation to earth moving equipment and service companies such as finance houses as in previous years a bonus again this year will be the announcement by the department of minerals and energy that its mining week will coincide with the show this means a lot to our brand as there will be several conferences and official visits coinciding with electra mining the continued support by the department of trade and industry and seven mining related associations also underscores the value of this event
8267407 in terms of creating value of all the exhibitions hosted in south africa electra mining must be the biggest money spinner for our country and is a brand that is recognised in all relevant global markets it is a platform to stimulate trade in the mining capital goods and electro technical sectors and requires a collective input from our exhibitions infrastructure suppliers in this regard we have had a long association with oasys innovations and as in previous years have again appointed them as one of our partners
8267408 electra mining means a lot to our company not only for our order book but specifically because of the international dimension of the show we have been involved with international clients locally and on other continents and electra mining is a brand that accompanies our international marketing initiatives wherever we go although electra mining is a huge effort for both specialised exhibitions and for the infrastructure suppliers we are fortunate that this will not deplete our stock of exhibition systems carpeting and electrical equipment during the last five years we have embarked on a capital expansion programme of around r12 million per annum as a consequence we can be a vendor to many different organisers and meet demand through our five activation companies

8267413 carriers can expect to become an integral part of consumers lifestyles when they can reliably deliver relevant advertisements to them
8267414 this will require closer cooperation and partnerships with other businesses such as retailers restaurants and cinemas
8267415 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently the government newspaper
8267416 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse mr mugabe told the lunch
8267417 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day mr mugabe said
8267418 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate mdc spokesman nelson chamisa said
8267419 hijack the leadership of zimbabwe and said the veteran leader was trying to ride roughshod over his political opponents
8267420 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8267421 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on mr chamisa said
8267422 but there hasnt been any formal communication from sadc from president mbeki to say this is the way forward
8267423 a declaration of war against the people amp squo amp squo

8267439 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans nuclear program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation

8267459 richard foster is doing a good job at right back and the defence looks fairly solid but i can understand jimmy being keen to bring in alan
8267460 it would allow richard to play elsewhere whereas alan is a natural right back who knows the game and his job
8267461 i think it would be better if the player shows a bit of commitment
8267462 i can understand him wanting to wait until the last minute to get the best deal he can but it would mean so much more to jimmy if he would come out and say he enjoyed it here last season and he wanted to come back and do his bit for aberdeen
8267463 if would be good to see that attitude because things might happen with other players who are showing commitment
8267464 things have dragged on and jimmy does not like that alan must know what he is doing so it is up to him but i would not push jimmy too far
8267465 what i can tell you about is that wed like to try and make some signings between now and the transfer deadline
8267466 weve got a good number of targets in mind and those may or may not materialise that wouldnt be any different to any premier league football club
8267467 we wouldnt mind trying to add to the squad if at all possible
8267468 it didnt materialise at that time so i just go back and say to you that we would like to try and add to the squad if at all possible were making every effort to do so and we wouldnt be the only club
8267469 it is a pointless exercise to talk about players either coming into the club or potentially going out we dont really want to lose anybody if its at all possible

8267515 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8267516 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president

8267519 the build up of nato forces in the black sea area
8267520 russia clearly intended this as a blatant challenge to world order its now up to all of us to roll russian aggression back if they get away with this they will carry on they will also attack other countries in the neighbourhood
8267521 we will be ready to make decisions including in the united nations on additional increases in the number of international monitors clarifying their mandate and possibly other steps with international participation
8267522 russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region we do not want a new cold war and he medvedev has a big responsibility not to start one
8267523 we are sorry about this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8267524 we will see how this will develop we are sticking strictly to the conditions on the timetable for the russian fleets presence there
8267525 now we have people flexing their muscles demonstrating force we can only regret that
8267526 this decision was taken at the highest level of the pentagon
8267527 this is a matter of grave concern to the united nations
8267528 it is vital that the international and afghan military forces thoroughly review the conduct of this operation in order to prevent a repeat of this tragic incident
8267529 foreign and afghan military personnel entered the village of nawabad in the azizabad area of shindand district
8267530 military operations lasted several hours during which airstrikes were called in
8267531 having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8267532 i cant blame the afghan national army for the incident as they had no authority for leading the operation
8267533 well keep doing it until we find the right way

8267536 one of the reasons we assign homework is to build attitudes of responsibility

8267544 apple believed the ad was not about technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilise they said all the websites featured in the ad were available on the iphone and were shown as they would be seen by the user they said none of the content in the ad was flash or java based and the ad did not mention any other technical capabilities of the iphone
8267545 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8267546 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone

8267561 hay que tener en cuenta que s lo la producci n de madonna son 88 trailers por lo que se necesita a mucha gente aunque ella ya trae a 500 personas

8267563 la importancia de promover el trasporte p blico para acceder al concierto
8267564 por ello se sacaron a la venta m s de 3 000 tickets de tren de cercan as que ya se han vendido
8267565 con el ticket se podr coger cualquiera de los autobuses en un intervalo horario determinado y lo mismo ocurrir para la vuelta donde durante unas cuatro horas se podr coger otro autocar para volver
8267566 para promover que la gente por ejemplo acuda a cheste por la ma ana y desde all coja un autob s que le desplazar hasta el circuito y despu s de devuelva a la localidad valenciana
8267567 lo que sobre todo se quiere conseguir con todas estas medidas es el escalonamiento tanto en la llegada como en la salida de los asistentes al concierto de madonna para evitar el menor n mero de atascos y problemas en las carreteras
8267568 as intentamos lograr que no todo el mundo se vaya cuando acabe el concierto
8267569 tambi n es recomendable que si se va en coche se intente que vayan llenos para que se reduzca su n mero lo m ximo posible y que no se colapsen los accesos
8267570 lo que de verdad queremos es que cuando a las 22 00 horas la gira sticky amp sweet tour de madonna comience en el circuito de cheste todo el mundo est dentro
8267571 si el d a del concierto a n quedan entradas a la venta tambi n se podr n adquirir en la fnac pero nunca en el circuito ya que queremos evitar al m ximo las aglomeraciones
8267572 habr n unos 88 trailers por lo que no va a faltar el sonido y se oir con la misma calidad en cualquier punto del recinto

8267574 alverson this election has nothing to do with what happened 40 years ago frankly im sick of regurgitating the 60s every four years give john mccain a medal a gold watch and a handshake we need a president focused on 2010s not the 60s

8267581 chris had just bought himself a horse which he shows and their daughter who goes to boarding school also rides
8267582 how can a course on selling life insurance have that much effect on anyone

8267584 whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe it can achieve
8267585 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
8267586 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
8267587 i am frustrated by people who seek sweeping reform there will never be a workable solution that eliminates the framework and replaces it its simply not feasible but working within the framework thats how change is brought about
8267588 its cruel and inhuman to subject an infant boy to mutilation and torture that he cant consent to

8267594 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8267595 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8267596 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8267597 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8267598 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8267599 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8267600 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

8267616 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8267617 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8267618 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8267619 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8267620 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs

8267627 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8267628 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8267629 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8267630 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8267631 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals

8267645 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8267646 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8267647 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8267648 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8267649 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8267650 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8267651 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8267652 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8267653 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8267654 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8267655 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8267656 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8267657 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8267658 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8267659 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8267660 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8267661 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8267662 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8267663 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8267664 we were called at 7 30am after a worker at the recycling centre discovered the body of a newborn baby
8267665 the scene has been preserved and we are the treating the death as suspicious the body was found amongst the rubbish
8267666 we are looking into the circumstances surrounding the death of this baby
8267667 it may be that she needs some medical attention urgently and we would urge her to go to a hospital
8267668 its clear hes trying to create any reason to rush to an election to hide how much he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the country this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to try and trigger an election and breaking his word
8267669 the president susilo said that this mission only fail if all of us quit
8267670 as our experience in handling aceh rebellion there was a setback the key to handling this business is never give up
8267671 president susilo said that indonesia wanted gambari to keep plying his constructive role under the support of the focus group
8267672 the president hopes for a resumption of dialogue between the myanmar government and aung san suu kyi
8267673 it was a us proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8267674 it was stressed that the deal should include the entire issues without any exception and without any partial or interim agreements

8267677 are you going to get all sucked into this hallmark moment and forget that this entire scene is politics pure and simple
8267678 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8267679 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8267680 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8267681 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8267682 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8267683 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8267684 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8267685 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8267686 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8267715 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day mr mugabe said
8267716 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate mdc spokesman nelson chamisa said
8267717 hijack the leadership of zimbabwe and said the veteran leader was trying to ride roughshod over his political opponents
8267718 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8267719 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on mr chamisa said
8267720 but there hasnt been any formal communication from sadc from president mbeki to say this is the way forward

8267748 abschaffen nicht abschaffen wieder abschaffen das wirrwar an positionen die die parteien momentan zur abschaffung der studiengeb hren haben ist die reinste zumutung f r alle studierende wir fordern eine bedingungslose abschaffung der studiengeb hren unter dem sofortigen ersatz der fehlenden mittel und mit einem vern nftigen konzept dahinter in keinem fall darf es aber zu einer weiteren beeintr chtigung der studienqualit t kommen

8267750 an manchen sterreichischen universit ten haben wir momentan studierenden professorenverh ltnisse die sich jenseits von 1 300 bewegen im internationalen vergleich ist das einzigartig schlecht hier muss man endlich ausreichend geld in die hand nehmen um die unterfinanzierung der sterreichischen universit ten zu beenden
8267751 die parteien tun momentan leider nichts anderes als zu versprechen was ihnen gerade in den sinn kommt an die umsetzung und die konsequenzen zu denken kommt ihnen dabei wieder einmal nicht in den sinn

8267756 dass dies ein noch mageres ergebnis ist steht au er frage weshalb ich schon seit jahren f r einen massiven ausbau pl diere

8267770 for me it was the key moment of the race
8267771 i dont know if it was the team or the driver who made the error

8267797 violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind and a recurrent even obsessive theme of culture both high and low it engages the interest of children from an early age as anyone familiar with the classic fairy tales collected by grimm andersen and perrault are aware to shield children right up to the age of 18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be quixotic but deforming it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it
8267798 all i can think of is that hes been given the nod
8267799 most of us would have liked to see him trying to qualify
8267800 he has stated his desire to make the team so he obviously thinks its better for him to be over there
8267801 every player who plays his way into the team makes the team stronger
8267802 he seems to have been on a hotline to nick for a while but it would have been nice for him to have played here
8267803 i cant really speak for anybody playing or not playing he has his own schedule
8267804 you might have thought he would have known that before he entered or pulled out of here

8267810 because of all the problems there city and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure
8267811 he is speaking with the manager luiz felipe scolari at the moment but he is settled in london
8267812 he would like to stay and thats the bottom line but it is up to the manager
8267813 are you able to see and understand what im trying to communicate
8267814 no id consider getting my game ready to make sure i make it in 2010
8267815 bernhard langer did that when he was left out in 1999 he was determined and made sure he was on the team the next time and that would be my goal
8267816 after much speculation i can confirm that gareth barry will not leave aston villa before the transfer window closes
8267817 gareth made the decision to stay two weeks ago and informed aston villa of his intentions
8267818 during this time discussions have taken place to decide the best way forward for all parties
8267819 any talks regarding potential new contracts at aston villa will not take place until the end of the season

8267836 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8267837 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8267838 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8267839 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8267840 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8267841 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8267842 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8267843 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8267844 who are open to doing something on the production side
8267845 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8267846 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8267847 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8267848 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8267849 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8267850 buyers will negotiate enthusiastically in the hope of justifying their purchase in the current climate and grabbing a bargain
8267851 when the offer is then accepted the buyer is sometimes surprised at how easy the negotiation was which can trigger a sudden lack of confidence
8267852 they begin to wonder if they should move ahead with the sale or if they can get an even lower price
8267853 most often this is happening with the very people the banks are keen to lend to low risk high deposit and high earning individuals so its not that buyers cant buy it is that they wont
8267854 i am not saying it is for everyone but in the uk we have become obsessive about how much our home is worth in monetary terms rather than how much it is worth in emotional terms
8267855 the most rewarding sales are to buyers genuinely looking for a home rather than a property as an investment
8267856 this type of buyer has an emotional attachment to a home they see it and they want to make it theirs
8267857 the good news is that this type of client usually ends up with the best investment of all type the characters you see in the picture above

8267867 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8267868 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8267869 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8267870 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8267871 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8267872 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8267873 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8267874 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8267875 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8267876 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8267877 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8267884 with the support of bison fans thundar plans to stampede the competition
8267885 we created this contest to celebrate the unsung heroes of college football
8267886 mascots work as hard as anyone on the field but are lost in the shadows of touchdown celebrations and pre season and post season accolades of the flashy all star quarterbacks and running backs
8267887 this is a great tribute to them and fans should show their support bragging rights and national recognition are on the line

8267892 i think that it could be a rather seamless fit for michael bishop to be integrated into what theyre doing over there i would not be surprised in fact i thought this the first time i heard the rumour that hes going to be playing this weekend
8267893 i think bishops going to know the system and now its just plugging him in and giving him a weeks worth of reps if youre going to make a commitment to him why wait another week why not start playing him now
8267894 the success that we could have over there and the game we played there last year in particular if you can get the crowd out of the game early thats the way to go itll be our emphasis as an offense to try to get something going quickly and eliminate the crowd and keep it that way im not talking about blowing them out althought that would be nice but its just a matter of getting early control of the game so that the crowd doesnt become that 13th player
8267895 that week was perfect for me the first 6 7 games i was banged up and knicked up but now theres no excuses and its time to play full speed i got a headstart on my preparation for them and im ready to be the dominant player i know i can be im quite sure the guys will be ready for this one its a special game
8267896 i started watching the grey cup because theyve been doing the same thing the past two years a lot of motion and trying to isolate certain guys im trying to focus on the things they had success on in the grey cup and pick out the bad things that i know theyre going to come back to ive been watching that stuff
8267897 i guess 34 years of football are catching up to me the fact that i am 38 i know i look a lot younger than that but the wear and tear has caught up with me the body isnt meant to go through this for 17 years hopefully i can get some practicing in but the main thing is that im healthy for the game

8267911 projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation
8267912 centre stage is our new australian style points based system which means only those we need can come here to work or study

8267923 it happened the day of the pre season game against wellington down in wollongong i woke up with a bit of a stiff neck didnt think a lot of it went out in the morning and did a little bit of a run but when i headed a ball i felt a shooting pain up my neck
8267924 after that i could barely move for the rest of that day and that remained the same for the next three or four days it then slowly improved over the week and a half before the season but then i aggravated it at training and now it seems to be ongoing
8267925 i just got an mri scan done on tuesday to find out exactly what the hell is going on because its just not getting better
8267926 on the wednesday before the match i aggravated it badly and if i was forced to make a call that day which i thought i had to do i would have pulled out
8267927 i learned a lesson last year when i injured my hip and played when i shouldnt have played and we lost 4 2 against perth i learned a lot from that but i talked to kossie and he was willing to back me which was important because the decision had been made for me i just concentrated on getting my neck as good as it could be for the game and it ended up not being a worry

8267955 hopefully i can do the best here its nice to get over that first match and there will be less and less pressure the further i go
8267956 its kind of tough because we havent had that the last couple years

8267959 every single player that we deal with i dont care what round youre talking about has representation has an agent
8267960 its been that way for the last four or five years and im talking even about kids drafted in the 28th round its a prerequisite now these agents are barraging us with telephone calls before we even select a player i cant even tell you how early agents try to call us and sell us on a player it starts way before the draft those arent calls that i initiate but im not going to hang up on the guy the problem is i guess the ncaas problem and its wide and far and deep but its not an issue for us it really isnt the college coaches know these guys are represented youd think the ncaa would get more involved if they care because were playing a charade here if we think these players are representing themselves and its just family advisers after they get drafted thats kind of a joke
8267961 the kids need advice thats precisely why they pick up an adviser
8267962 at the same time theres a rule against agents representing players and its basically ignored by everyone people will get away with whatever they can get away with if theres no standards or guidelines or its not followed up on people are going to take advantage if youre going to have a rule like that you need to have some stick toitiveness at the college level i dont think administrators understand this part of college baseball the recruiting part of it where there is this type of activity going on i just dont think people know enough about it
8267963 if the ncaa is going to get serious about enforcement it needs to start by coming to grips with the simple reality that agents are omnipresent in college baseball in the 21st century then it needs to either actively work to change that reality a daunting and unrealistic goal or else rethink its rules against the industry norm

8268109 the political and social will of the community that will be part of their decision but its not part of our task
8268110 its an expensive business to get into initially at the front end
8268111 we stepped up our patrols in the northeast and it appears this issues pretty mobile and this individual or individuals has a vehicle and just goes to different areas
8268112 you know you close your eyes and your whole world changes
8268113 i have never once suspected him i know when somebody is high and stuff and i never saw that he loved his corona
8268114 but that was about the worst it could get he was a corona man he was so careful he didnt even go out to the bars he did his job and went home
8268115 aggressively leveled the gun in the direction of this male and yelled for him to stop as he did this the gun discharged the male victim fell to the ground
8268116 acknowledged that he did not intend or plan for what happened to ben and sarah
8268117 columbia seems to have an interest in its history and recognizing people who have been important in some way
8268118 its a way to acknowledge columbians who have achieved something out of the ordinary for that time i like the idea of staying in touch with our historical roots
8268119 chuck grahams use of his public position for his personal gain by supplementing his income with lobbyist perks is absolutely indefensible
8268120 hes being phelpsian in his attempt to take the most out of the 197 lawmakers
8268121 from time to time i go out to dinner with people like terry schlemeier who represents the city of columbia and the
8268122 flagship council and we disclose it people can look at it and make decisions about whether or not its an issue or not
8268123 its not been an issue thats concerned people the last 12 years and i dont think its going to be one thats going to be in the next four years
8268124 he kind of already got the biggest gift of all from special interests by getting the partnership over at lathrop amp gage
8268125 a couple of years ago he was a junior partner at lathrop amp gage and obviously he went to work over at dnr and as deputy director he gave a no bid contract for legal services on taum sauk to lathrop amp gage and then left the state
8268126 after saying he was going to handle that in house and save taxpayer money left to go to lathrop amp gage and was awarded a partnership in that account
8268127 he used his position in state government to leverage a partnership in
8268128 thats the type of self dealing that the blunts and the people who work for him like kurt schaefer have been engaged in for the last four years
8268129 basically you have to go the east coast or d c to get somebody with that type of experience
8268130 i can tell you thats why the decision was made to hire lathrop

8268133 every participant would have guaranteed access to 500 in yearly preventive medical services
8268134 im not going to propose anything that puts the state budget in jeopardy
8268135 there is kind of standard organization behavior to keep doing what youve been doing in a tight budget year and look at how to distribute the increase in a year with more money
8268136 but what gets lost is you never stop and ask yourself if changes are taking place and you need to stop and look at your priorities
8268137 its not only a look at what are we doing that we want to keep doing
8268138 its also a look at what are we not doing that the money should go toward and what have we done in the past that we should not be doing
8268139 we can then choose to allocate it right back and i suspect we would in most cases but at least it gives us the option

8268164 demonstrates the central paradox of portfolio diversification obviously a concentrated portfolio maximizes your chance of a superb result unfortunately at the same time it also maximizes your chance of a poor result this issue gets to the heart of why we invest you can have two possible goals one is to maximize your chances of getting rich i e active management the other is to minimize your odds of failing to meet your goals i e indexing it is important to realize that these goals are mutually exclusive

8268170 typically what weve done at the beginning of nearly every season is try to have multiple quarterbacks play in the first half
8268171 we do the same thing with our offensive line just get out there and get their nose bloodied a little bit shake off the nerves
8268172 weve had a lot of flooding problems on the east side of our state weve had tornadoes crop damage very violent rains

8268174 nobody has better fans but our challenges right now in the state are more paramount
8268175 the players always have the game in the back of their mind
8268176 our guys enjoy the fact theyre able to compete against a top team like missouri you want to know exactly where you are playing missouri gives you that opportunity
8268177 it will speed the game up so much that it will in fact shorten it
8268178 theres going to be a lot less plays this could shorten the game by 10 15 plays per team i dont think thats good i wasnt a big supporter of it but i can understand people trying to speed the game up it will be interesting as we get into the season how its officiated and handled
8268179 we have some name recognition and we have some excellent talent

8268193 thats what i like about life in general we dont know
8268194 it was obviously maybe the biggest pitch in the game
8268195 we got ourselves in a position where one pitch can turn the game around and masterson comes in and makes one pitch and gets out of the inning that was huge
8268196 in my respects hes a good righthanded hitter and when im called upon im supposed to get the job done i won that time
8268197 obviously i love that stuff thats why you play the game
8268198 we dont panic here you hit the panic button you just get worse right right
8268199 lou cucuzza the clubhouse guy got me some dirt from the mound its pretty special playing in this league the last 14 15 years and pitching here for such a long period of time its such a cathedral of sports
8268200 to walk the hallowed grounds that such great players before us have played their game and walked and ran and hit its pretty special
8268201 thats about as big a situation as youre going to find poise is not a problem he deserves to be used in those situations
8268202 that was probably what we were hoping for getting one pitch and getting out of that inning is the best case scenario he made a very good pitch and we got out of that inning

8268213 we need strong tariff protection and interventionist policy to secure the future of the manufacturing sectors in australia
8268214 when we scored the seven runs it just felt like we would keep going and its the same thing when you dont score things snowball
8268215 well keep doing it until we find the right way
8268216 you forget that you get paid to play the game it was almost like we felt like little kids

8268247 pregnant women perhaps the elderly the immunocompromised should avoid deli meats most of the time if not all of the time
8268248 i dont think there was any strong recommendation in terms of deli meats so i think that this is a new incident that may have people thinking that has to be reconsidered
8268249 i think all the facilities that have used the meat should be listed in b c so that people know
8268250 if they ate deli meat or they think they might have eaten maple leaf deli meat and theyre not ill right now theres no tests anyone can do to tell if theyre going to come down with the illness or not

8268258 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
8268259 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere

8268293 well i must say the handover ceremony was a complete disgrace it really seemed like some nursery panto compared to the no expense spared west end show which was done by the people of beijing absolutely no idea how to market london

8268295 unlike the chinese custom which tends not to reveal their weakness to the outsiders the british seem to like to laugh about their stupidity in a funny way during the performance when the london bus pulled over all the passengers waiting for the bus rushed into the door at the same time which truly damaged the british image

8268304 this conversation about sustainability kind of hit us right between the eyes
8268305 we went out and started talking to a lot of people about agriculture and what doing more with less would look like what would be important there
8268306 our goal is to make every farmer we serve better off the next year than they were the previous year
8268307 in developing countries we think we also need to do that
8268308 so weve committed to helping 5 million resource poor farmers who are simply trying to feed their families do that
8268309 its going to be the we collectively that does this
8268310 what were looking at here is using ac voltage or very low voltage injecting it into the soil with two electrodes
8268311 then were actually measuring the voltage with another pair and the conductivity is actually driven by the sand silt clay content of the soil so the heavy clays are highly conductive silts are in the mid range and sands are very poor conductors
8268312 generate a yield potential map and ultimately an input map based on those soil differential zones
8268313 in the last few months weve seen inputs just rise dramatically and if youre going to stay competitive in this environment youre really going to have to pinpoint your inputs and really minimize your expense on areas that arent very productive

8268330 there was a gathering of political momentum for a more radical approach than the investment and home loans industries had so far countenanced
8268331 unfortunately at this point the available information seems to show that foreclosures continue at an unacceptably high level while true loan modifications are lagging
8268332 it is important that servicers demonstrate and document real progress soon or they invite regulatory and legislative action to supplement the industrys actions
8268333 stop what youre doing or youre going to find yourself dead
8268334 the incredible feeling of betrayal from my colleagues id worked with these people for years
8268335 it is a spiritual crisis it is a psychological breakdown
8268336 what shocked the hong kong policeman was that the triad member had phoned someone in the canadian immigration ministers office in ottawa
8268337 the officer commented with that kind of relationship youve got a really serious problem
8268338 dont worry about mcadam and what hes doing well take care of him
8268339 i was mocked demeaned and threatened in a hostile environment while dealing with some of the worlds most ruthless criminals staff in both hong kong and in ottawa gave copies of my confidential reports about some of the criminals to the gangsters themselves and that greatly put my life at risk i received death threats for a number of years but no one has ever been concerned about my safety the big question was why did canadian diplomats in hong kong and bureaucrats in ottawa do whatever they could to destroy my work and myself
8268340 as soon as one mountie would investigate theyd pull him off
8268341 another officer would come along start to make discoveries and would be pulled off
8268342 i believe both probes by the sidewinder team and by the rcmp had considerable political interference to shut them down
8268343 and it seemed to be coming from the highest levels
8268344 they found that crime members with ties to chinas military intelligence had invested billions in canada
8268345 i never dreamed this would be the outcome all kinds of material just gone
8268346 the sidewinder team leader was demoted after submitting the report he resigned and csiss almost sole china expert also resigned in disgust
8268347 at least six investigations by the u s senate and congress from 1997 to 2003 corroborated sidewinders findings
8268348 though senior management at csis maligned the report as rumour laced conspiracy theory others saw it as groundbreaking and years ahead of the curve
8268349 one of the worlds centres for chinese organized crime and espionage
8268350 i feel better than i have for 15 years i feel fantastic tremendous i feel back to normal
8268351 the love of my wife marie id never be alive without her she nurtured me and cared for me beyond belief
8268352 i wanted to stop chinese criminals and spies from trying to destroy our country
8268353 i dont know how to describe it any other way i dont think we should be selling our country to china
8268354 but the baggage that comes with every great bicycle town is that youre a target for bike theft we have people stopping by free cycles just about every day saying their bike has been stolen
8268355 were not really seeing thefts of a particular class of bikes
8268356 a lot of times these are crimes of opportunity where the bike is not secured properly
8268357 people are just going to run in somewhere for a minute and when they come back out their bike is gone
8268358 is just a sign that says get your free bike right here
8268359 in 2007 we had a lot of cable locks that were just cut
8268360 you can buy this thing called a cable cutter at any hardware store its shaped just like bolt cutters it will walk right through half inch cable just as clean as if you were cutting string with scissors
8268361 i dont know of any bikes that have been stolen on campus that were locked with a u lock

8268389 the world of persuasion had been long gone even when she had read it as a girl believing it to be the norm yet jane austen had never gone out of fashion rather the opposite it was as if those who flouted traditional values long to be reminded of fine manners even if they marveled at them and made little attempt to emulate them

8268399 they are singing modern songs in a new and fresh arrangements its going to make people think that they too can sing out in the bathroom
8268400 it does show the number of people who are viewing it i think there will be a lot more people wanting to join as a result
8268401 we had new recruits before we broke up for august i do think that the programme has stimulated a lot of interest and helped people to make that commitment
8268402 the well publicised success of choirs such as froncysyllte and only men aloud has assisted to some degree in attracting new recruits
8268403 all of a sudden my friends who have nothing to do with ysgol glanaethwy have an interest and im sure i could say that about all the other members
8268404 its not that they werent supportive in the past but they were much more interested in what were doing now than if we hadnt been on television
8268405 there will probably be more people applying in september and probably much younger applications

8268421 a successful system will not only improve the quality of the recycled polymer but it will enable new to be manufactured with a higher recycled content in closed loop recycling systems
8268422 increasing the use of recycled content will deliver carbon dioxide co2 savings through greater substitution of virgin polymer in the manufacture of new bottles as well as conserve valuable resources and divert waste from landfill
8268423 the roadmap contains targets for closed loop recycling of plastic milk bottles as well as dairies sending near zero waste to landfill
8268424 other projects include lightweighting bottles to reduce the amount of plastic used in making each one and offering consumers the option of fresh milk in bags which generates far less waste than a bottle

8268431 at the end of the day running around saying my guy is the messiah over and an echo chamber
8268432 and what the rebbe was creating was the opposite of an echo chamber
8268433 the rebbe says you have to be crazy about moshiach
8268434 did i tell you about the time i got arrested
8268435 it violates common sense and makes the movement seem insane
8268436 they think it turns people off to hasidic teaching and its a sincere concern
8268437 when people tell me that the kind of scene i just described is crazy
8268438 i react by saying that there are millions of people in the world who are perfectly normal and intelligent people who believe that the priest is holding a piece of bread and that this bread is the real presence of jesus of nazareth
8268439 judaism says that in every generation there is a righteous person that connects the world to the divine energy
8268440 if there is no leader the world would actually cease to exist so the fact that the rebbe has died and that the world continues to exist is a conundrum to them and it leads them to believe that the rebbe must not have died but even people who believe he did die find this to be a challenging question
8268441 with your luck yechi ha melech youll find the meat
8268442 you shall not kill the child by obtaining an abortion nor again shall you destroy him after he is born
8268443 you shall not murder a child by abortion nor kill one who has been born
8268444 we say that those women who use drugs to bring on abortion commit murder and we also say that we will have to give an account to god for the abortion
8268445 in our case murder is once for all forbidden therefore we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb while as yet the human being derives blood from other parts of the body for its sustenance to hinder a birth is merely a speedier way to kill a human it does not matter whether you take away a life that has been born or destroy one that is not yet born
8268446 indeed the law of moses punishes with appropriate penalties the person who causes abortion for there already exists the beginning stages of a human being and even at this stage the fetus is already acknowledged with having the condition of life and death since he is already susceptible to both
8268447 are you to dissolve the conception by aid of drugs i believe it is no more lawful to hurt a child in process of birth than to hurt one who is already born
8268448 there are some women who by drinking medical preparations extinguish the source of the future man in their very bowels so they commit murder before they bring forth
8268449 the womb of his wife was hit by a blow of his heel and in the miscarriage that soon followed the offspring was brought forth the fruit of a fathers murder
8268450 the soul is not introduced into the body after birth as some philosophers think rather it is introduced immediately after conception when the divine necessity has formed the offspring in the womb

8268459 apple believed the ad was not about technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilise they said all the websites featured in the ad were available on the iphone and were shown as they would be seen by the user they said none of the content in the ad was flash or java based and the ad did not mention any other technical capabilities of the iphone

8268466 the psychological test is aimed at checking whether or not the coping mechanism of filipino workers is well
8268467 even dfa and embassy officials undergo a mandatory psychological test before we are deployed to other countries it is needed simply because it is very stressful overseas
8268468 the tests are discriminatory against departing domestic workers and the psychiatric tests are an additional burden to ofws and another reason for government to exact unreasonable fees from us
8268469 the psych test is indicative of what conejos will bring to the upcoming gfmd in october the government will merely play lip service to protecting and empowering migrants

8268504 when you think of what the ordinary workers in carlow were put through something is very wrong somewhere
8268505 on december 3 carlow county council voted to re zone the greencore land then five months later mr dilger gets his pay out
8268506 every single new apartment built there has been well above flood levels
8268507 look there were three apartments flooded and the fact of the matter is that they were renovated old buildings whose developers were well aware of the situation and decided to continue using them
8268508 everyone was completely aware of the risks and nobody was out in the dark here what are we supposed to do tell people to move out of their premises because they cant afford to raise their ground level we would be putting people out of business and that is the truth of it
8268509 since time began people have settled next to rivers to utilise them you arent going to move london or move new york as you just because it is near a river
8268510 that of course does not diminish the trauma for the people involved and of course we heard many intimations from people that planning should not have been allowed in the area because it is a flood plain but let me be clear this is not a flood plain this is the town centre and these are prime riverside developments
8268511 that is untrue the council has at all times been proactive in targeting this and we have inherited no problems from other councils at no time has any one council been less proactive than another in dealing with this
8268512 we expect that the flood relief scheme will be started in the coming months and would certainly be finished within two years it is part of a national flood relief scheme and at the time carlow put in its application however other areas like clonmel and kilkenny took precedence but now it is carlows turn
8268513 he is excellent he is going to go far when he sang at the talent show all i could say was oh my god there were 600 people there and you could have heard a pin drop and it was a difficult song called my r isin which is an irish ballad
8268514 and hes won county titles leinsters and hes back in a leinster semi final this saturday
8268515 i am proud of him but when you get two boys after having 10 girls they dont have to sing a song to make you proud we got the boys eventually because the auld lad wanted someone to play handball with

8268518 i contacted the kilkenny coroner two weeks ago and he told me that he was waiting on a report from pathology in waterford
8268519 but when i rang the office in waterford they told me that they had issued those reports to the coroner a month ago i rang the coroner back and he said hed check his records
8268520 he said thered have to be an inquest and wed have to wait for the garda report

8268523 i am being constantly followed into woodies car park where i normally meet pupils for driving lessons and being asked how should both the hanover and the burrin roundabouts be approached correctly
8268524 g along the new inner relief road and you are going to the n9 waterford exit you should approach in the left lane and keep close to the left then signal left after passing the first exit first left turn then stay in the left lane approaching the hanover roundabout and after passing the woodies exit signal left and continue straight on
8268525 g you approach in the left hand lane keep close to the left hand side and signal left as you enter the roundabout then as you exit and approach the burrin roundabout safely and quickly signal right and move into the right hand lane then as you pass the middle of the fairgreen exit which is the second exit the second turn off you signal left and move off towards ire
8268526 i can be contacted on 086 8111365 if anyone needs any advice on any aspect of driving
8268527 that question makes it clear you have never built a house before

8268540 een dak boven je hoofd is zo ongeveer de meest basale behoefte van ieder mens het is onvoorstelbaar dat ieder jaar miljoenen mensen op de vlucht raken omdat ze in n klap nagenoeg alles kwijt zijn dit probleem m et beter belicht worden daarom heeft 3fm dit jaar vluchtelingenhulp gekozen als onderwerp voor serious request het is fantastisch dat de gemeente breda daar ons dit jaar bij gaat helpen
8268541 het is voor breda natuurlijk een enorme opsteker dat 3fm onze stad als thuisbasis voor deze actie heeft gekozen we realiseren ons terdege dat we aardig wat waar te maken hebben en dat kunnen we samen in deze stad en regio we investeren er flink in om een sociale stad te zijn we zetten veel in op zorg voor elkaar en sociale cohesie ook over de grenzen heen breda levert een bijdrage aan het realiseren van de vn millenniumdoelen en gaat bewust om met internationale solidariteit in die context sluiten de doelen van serious request aan bij onze ambities kortom we zullen als een goede gastheer voor deze actie zorgen en samen inzetten op een enorme opbrengst

8268575 if you look the consumption rates and how much were paying for power these days i think the department of defense housing used about 11 trillion btu british thermal unit of power in 2007
8268576 the intent is to take all of the lessons learned in the technologies see how they perform over time and disseminate that information not only to other military housing projects but to other private housing
8268577 it seems like housing is the growing area in the military
8268578 i see it as the opportunity for technology transfer is high because were building so much not just at fort campbell but across the military
8268579 there will be times of the day where were actually drawing power from the power grid just like every other house but there will also be times of the day where we will be producing more power than the home is demanding
8268580 that power will be sent back to the power grid

8268673 i was too young for woodstock i didnt really start going to concerts until my youngest son was old enough
8268674 i am almost 50 years old and i certainly dont want to be condemned i dont want to be looked upon as some kind of used up dude
8268675 we created this scene we deserve to be there we belong there
8268676 i think its pretty remarkable that i get to see people that are below nine showing up at our festival and then people in their 50s showing up at our festival and they all seem to appreciate and enjoy the music across the board
8268677 i think our partners have always pretty much stood by the fact that were a family festival
8268678 obviously lollapalooza for the last four years hasnt been like lollapalooza of the early 90s
8268679 we are a company of 25 38 as well and we know what we were going to want to go do if we were going to pay the money turns out thats who come to our festivals too
8268680 but we always keep in mind that its getting a little older and thats very interesting especially for lollapalooza
8268681 theres certainly some thought that goes into how do we make the event as broad as possible
8268682 we really wanted to have a whole stage to dedicate to that genre of music to appeal to a little bit of an older audience
8268683 in some cases theres actually three generations that are out there
8268684 when i was growing up in the 60s and 70s the music i was listening to my father was not listening to that music
8268685 now you go forward to 2008 and people are still listening to jimi hendrix
8268686 for better or worse and its not always for better it is my natural state i cant help it
8268687 hes manipulating all his little kingdoms and empires from afar
8268688 they have to solve crimes each week that are happening due to experiments being executed by people who are using the whole world as guinea pigs
8268689 spending all that time being pumped full of drugs and having electric shock therapy has made him a little bit unstable
8268690 not to say he wasnt when he went in there
8268691 most of this fringe stuff is actually possible which makes it interesting and scary at the same time
8268692 a rogue a brilliant nomad who doesnt really know what his purpose is
8268693 hes essentially the bridge between walters techno babble and english
8268694 he serves to say ok those are the four things that make sense and then these are the 16 things that dont make sense
8268695 shes straight down the line fbi who has been exposed to this other world and is reeling from trying to comprehend it
8268696 she wrangles peter and walter in and maintains the focus of the trio
8268697 we were talking about how much we missed working on a tv show together
8268698 though that character was very different from walter bishop we thought theres a series about a guy like this
8268699 the truth is that the fans of lost or alias are the people we are beholden to
8268700 i actually dont think of them as fans the people who are into those shows are also fans of the shows that i am interested in

8268749 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8268750 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

8268768 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8268769 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8268770 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8268771 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8268772 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8268773 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8268774 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8268775 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught

8268778 der markt ist mittlerweile so transparent geworden dass sobald ein konkurrent wie schaeffler eine beteiligung von nur drei prozent an conti ffentlich macht sofort die spekulanten da sind vom hedgefonds bis zu den pensionskassen f r beamte
8268779 dann explodiert der kurs und das f hrt im zweifelsfall dazu dass der kurs eben nicht mehr die realit t abbildet sondern ein konstrukt aus hoffnungen und spekulationen
8268780 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8268781 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning

8268783 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

8268791 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

8268795 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8268796 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8268797 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8268798 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8268799 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8268800 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8268801 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8268802 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8268803 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8268804 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8268805 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8268806 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8268807 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8268808 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8268809 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8268810 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8268811 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8268812 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8268813 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8268814 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8268815 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8268816 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8268817 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8268818 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8268819 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8268820 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8268821 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8268822 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8268823 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8268824 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8268825 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8268826 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8268827 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8268828 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8268829 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8268830 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8268831 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8268832 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8268833 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8268834 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8268835 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8268836 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8268837 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8268838 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8268839 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8268840 defendants intentional spoliation of computer evidence significantly prejudices plaintiffs because it puts the most relevant evidence of their claim permanently beyond their reach
8268841 the deliberate destruction by itself compels the conclusion that such evidence supported plaintiffs case

8268851 make the information society an opportunity for sustainable development based on principles of solidarity
8268852 the information society is the very basis of the knowledge society and the new economy it offers the potential for higher value added more advanced services greater competitiveness and better employability
8268853 there will be those for whom race is the deciding issue but i believe their numbers are few for many more well meaning and tolerant people i believe the reason is fear it is fear of the unknown but not only fear of the unknown obama
8268854 i believe that the real fear is finding out what lies behind the big lies of george bush and more ominously by far dick cheney karl rove and a host of other neo con artists
8268855 this foreign visitor doesnt believe that this election is about race it is about the difficulty and the sacrifice involved in changing course acknowledging error actively working for a better common future
8268856 it is a battle over the kind of complacency and fear of change that put into the oval office its most underqualified occupant in living memory
8268857 studying the position isnt really the thing playing running back you know the fullback position
8268858 pass blocking is the same its not like i have to learn too much more for the most part you know a lot of the fullback responsibility from being a running back i would say its just the run blocking
8268859 most things are the same you just know it because youre in the same meeting room its not really much of a change pass plays youre still doing the same thing on every pass play the only thing that changes is the run blocking and its not that hard the guys going to come to you its more about just wanting to do it
8268860 thats about it just from playing last year you understand that brians going to play at running back and theres not really much room for a lot of other guys to play you just know that you just want to play football you want to get in the game so any time theyre telling you they want to put you on the football field thats a good thing
8268861 its kind of frustrating trying to pick up a position this late in the preseason
8268862 its like all right youve been doing this for a year and a half but now were going to try something different you have to start all over and get on the same page as guys who have been in there doing it so you know it is a little frustrating
8268863 ive only been doing this for a week and a half it would be like me asking you how long it would take you to go be an astronaut
8268864 my rule of thumb the man who knows too much is always eliminated in spy novels and the same is true whether one likes it or not in american presidential elections
8268865 we dont usually have that number of aryan nations people here said denver police chief victor ross

8268960 how many of us really decide which customers are sold to
8268961 in my experience some of my customers are not my choice by a long shot rather i have to find a way to deal with everyone thats presented to me
8268962 a policy that mandates and dictates certain behaviors always has to have an exception based rule at least thats what ive found in my experience
8268963 were flooded with information from the internet from alerts weve set up in the credit world its so much information that its hard to put that all into a funnel and have it come out and translate into a one size fits all policy
8268964 money is tightening up and credit is really getting a spotlight at this point in time i think we all agree that theres tension within our own companies with the attention on being paid accounts receivable and credit extension practices are under scrutiny
8268965 in the global marketplace many things from wars to fuel are creating uncertainty
8268966 look at the global marketplace and be aware of what is around you sometimes as credit people we can be very binary just looking at the yes and no of a credit decision without really considering all of these external factors
8268967 as credit people there are some departments that we dont interact with but we should
8268968 our sales department thats a no brainer we know we are dealing with sales we know we are dealing with order management somehow or another we dont look at product development as something we need to concern ourselves with and thats a mistake for credit people to take that approach its important for you to understand where your company fits and what solutions they have planned for in the future
8268969 is your company sales or top line driven versus profits profits profits that dictates how youre going to react in the credit granting area if you are really bottom line driven you may be really tough on credit and softer on collections if youre soft on credit typically youre working for a very marketing driven company a very sales driven company thats like ship it ship it ship it if you have that kind of attitude you better be tough on the collections side
8268970 well the world is how it is theres nothing we can do so lets exploit the fucker

8268976 the aim is for him to be a crucial player for us but that is not down to me because he will have to be the one to prove it on the pitch

8269226 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8269227 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8269228 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8269229 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there

8269376 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8269385 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica
8269386 altri quatto anni come gli otto che abbiamo gi passato
8269387 sono molto onorata di essere qui stanotte come madre orgogliosa democratica orgogliosa americana orgogliosa e una orgogliosa sostenitrice di barack obama
8269388 non importa se avete votato per me o per barack ha affermato e giunto adesso il momento di essere uniti come un partito unito con uno scopo preciso siamo tutti nella stessa squadra e nessuno pu permettersi di stare ai bordi del campo
8269389 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8269390 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti
8269391 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8269392 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8269393 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8269394 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8269395 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8269396 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8269397 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8269398 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8269399 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8269400 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8269401 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8269402 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8269403 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8269404 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8269405 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8269406 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8269407 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8269408 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8269409 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8269410 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8269411 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8269412 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8269413 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8269414 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8269415 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8269416 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8269417 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8269418 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8269419 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8269420 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8269421 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8269422 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8269423 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8269424 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8269425 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8269426 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8269427 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8269428 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8269429 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8269430 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8269431 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8269432 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8269433 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8269434 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8269435 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8269436 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8269437 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8269438 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8269439 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8269440 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8269441 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8269442 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8269443 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8269444 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8269445 yes i did it this is the reason i did it and i would do it again in a heartbeat
8269446 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8269447 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta
8269448 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8269449 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia
8269450 oggi la russia torna in una condizione di forza soprattutto per il suo profilo energetico
8269451 partnership interesse anche della russia e che nessuno vuole tornare alla guerra fredda

8269456 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8269457 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8269458 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8269467 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8269468 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno

8269476 thats the thing that sticks with you even if she can move on easily thats not as easy for everybody else
8269477 im not going to vote for obama im not going to vote for mccain either
8269478 a lot of us loved campaigning for her and its hard to watch it end but after something like this you have to have an emotional end for people to come to terms with things
8269479 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary
8269480 obama has nothing he has no experience the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
8269481 to be honest that would make this whole thing a lot easier

8269484 maar het tweede boek is aanzienlijk lastiger te verfilmen dan het eerste ik heb alle vertrouwen in de makers maar zolang er niets op papier staat geef ik nog geen definitief fiat
8269485 this trend is pretty astounding but what i make of it is that catholic school boards face parents who have a choice and as a result they may manage their resources better
8269486 stronger results at catholic boards suggest that competition improves school results since catholic parents can choose to send their children to either catholic or public schools
8269487 catholic board managers may be responding by improving the quality of education to attract students and funding
8269488 but it sort of makes sense that the level of service will be higher in a system where people have a choice
8269489 we went through an election where we decided we were not going to fund faith based independent schools without ever really having a serious debate about whether opening up active competition between schools would produce better learning outcomes
8269490 thats an absolute leap with no sound basis its a huge leap to say this means we should have faith based schools
8269491 it might be that parents who choose to send their children to a catholic school are more engaged in their childrens education by virtue of the fact they have made that selection
8269492 or it could be there is a more homogeneous ethos in the school a sense of shared community values and a sense of identity as a group a factor also believed to promote learning said fullan
8269493 but this sort of ethos can be created in public schools as well by promoting lots of deep moral values such as equity and fairness i would call these spiritual values even though theyre secular things like cooperation and cohesion
8269494 heads of the class a comparison of ontario school boards by student achievement
8269495 the toronto district school board does fabulous work and this business of one system being better than the other is really misleading
8269496 our whole purpose is to address the needs of the whole student including their spiritual health something the public schools have no mandate to address
8269497 you have to understand tu a desk job isnt for me im a lobster who longs only to be thrown back into the starry sea that is my real home
8269498 in western society we dont pay enough respect to people who live in nature

8269500 the waiter said the guardian peak shiraz is big robust and aggressive just like a rhino but dont worry this rhino wont kill you its delicious and they thought this was the funniest thing they ever heard

8269502 we also hope the newly trained wine ambassadors will make wine their alcoholic beverage of choice and reach a broader base of south africans and introduce them to wine appreciation

8269508 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
8269509 with any new technology theres a hype cycle its not clear that ami has been through the part of the cycle where expectations are not met
8269510 all of the departments concerns have already been vetted and expressed
8269511 dado el aumento de las fuerzas de la otan en el mar negro la flota rusa ha comenzado a tomar medidas para supervisar su actividad

8269514 ha cavado con sus propias manos una fosa de sangre entre georgia y estas dos rep blicas lo que hace imposible que convivan juntos todos en un mismo estado
8269515 en estas condiciones no hab a otra soluci n que reconocer la independencia de las dos rep blicas para proteger a la poblaci n de las dos territorios para evitar las matanzas de las ltimas semanas
8269516 no s si los ciudadanos occidentales se dan cuenta del peligro que supone shaakasvili un hombre que dice estar dispuesto a quemar el mundo para hacerse los huevos fritos
8269517 rusia sigui buscando una soluci n negociada en el marco de la integridad territorial de georgia
8269518 al principio explicaron que se trataba de unas maniobras rutinarias que no ten a nada que ver con la situaci n en el c ucaso y nos parec a leg timo pero aparecieron m s buques ahora son diez y est previsto que aumenten hasta 18
8269519 no se puede dejar de pensar que esto tiene otros objetivos como una demostraci n de fuerza o algo parecido
8269520 es una situaci n preocupante que no contribuye a la resoluci n de la crisis
8269521 las fuentes de tensi n estar n en otra parte avance de las fronteras de la otan hacia rusia construcci n del sistema antimisiles cerca de rusia establecimiento de bases militares cerca de nuestras fronteras

8269526 yeah the world is going to hell but wow doesnt my eton s350 really grab 89 3 fm with boldness and clarity
8269527 what a poor lost soul this is definitely someone who needs my help
8269528 we went everywhere for over a month but it did not help the perpetrators are walking around free in the bazaar and the former provincial police chief supports them nobody cares about us
8269529 we complained to the police chief but he threatened me and cursed me and told me not to make a big deal out of it
8269530 we are searching for them but they seem to have escaped
8269531 karzais action in this case has given us some hope
8269532 as the proverb says you cannot have two different kinds of weather over one roof
8269533 if this happens people will start distrusting the government again
8269534 it was just a symbolic action there are hundreds of such cases in afghanistan where the government is silent
8269535 impossible that president karzai could knowingly have signed a pardon for rapists
8269536 we have received ten cases of rape so far this year
8269537 most victims families are not ready to let us know
8269538 a lot of people cannot afford to get married so they quench their sexual urges by abusing children who make easy targets
8269539 if people see that there is no punishment for this crime then they too can go out and commit similar actions
8269540 we do not believe in provincial courts because the accused mans relatives are very powerful there and they rule over everybody
8269541 nobody can punish the son in that province because his father owns the law there
8269542 the presidents decree regarding the punishment of the rapists shows the weakness of the law in afghanistan
8269543 this is not an exceptional matter to be resolved by an exceptional decree from the president
8269544 it is a social problem which can be solved with the rule of law
8269545 sexual assaults take place almost every day in afghanistan is the president going to issue a decree every day that just isnt possible
8269546 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia

8269548 there was only one difference between the surat and the ahmedabad bombs and that is the surat bombs did not explode
8269549 surat residents were fortunate that the bombs didnt go off there is a clear link between ahmedabad and surat bombs
8269550 we have arrested tanveer pathan and jahir patel two locals who played a major role in helping those who had come from outside to plant bombs in the city
8269551 mufti abu bashir sajid mansuri yunus mansuri and samsuddin sheikh arrested for ahmedabad blasts were directly involved in planting bombs in surat they all are associated with simi
8269552 the output current of transistor used in bombs planted in the city was insufficient to detonate the explosives
8269553 when we set it right for experiment in our office they exploded
8269554 interrogation is going on and we cannot give further details at this stage

8269599 time and again governor rendell has publicly denied pennsylvanias health care delivery crisis exists in spite of the fact that patients have died due to the commonwealths loss of trauma care services and mothers and their unborn babies have lost access to delivery room services throughout philadelphia and beyond

8269660 i expect the recent decline in oil prices will begin to reverse some of the pressures we have seen on overall inflation in the first half of the year

8269675 we have had no discussions with jake white on the subject and in fact the principle of a director of rugby post will only be reviewed by the presidents council on friday

8269678 if he had continued the slowest he would have run would have been 9 52
8269679 this is his first year of running the 100 metres
8269680 in two more years he should be peaking at this distance and by then i am certain he will be down to there
8269681 hopefully the feds will back off in instances where people are really following these guidelines
8269682 clearly there have been abuses places that served as big fronts for illegal drug dealing
8269683 as far as im concerned i give this two thumbs up
8269684 if youre in it for profit you shouldnt be in medical cannabis
8269685 hopefully this will send a message to the federal government that california doesnt intend to deter from the course it has set
8269686 we have been operating in the dark for many years
8269687 has been like trying to hit a moving target this allows us to know what the target is
8269688 we know that cartels are controlling many of the medical marijuana dispensaries operating for profit
8269689 im hopeful the state will partner with local police and the feds to shut down the cartels
8269690 were making a big big push we feel that a literate community will increase our childrens performance in schools and help adults be more successful
8269691 books can have such an impact on childrens lives the sooner we put children in touch with books the better
8269692 it never hurts to talk about literacy and reading especially at a young age
8269693 dont get to the library as often as they should
8269694 there are a lot of pieces from each individual group aimed at literacy
8269695 so we can direct efforts to make more of a difference
8269696 for third graders that will be items like being able to describe where they live and who they live with
8269697 by the time the measure reaches the ballot in 2010 hundreds perhaps thousands of out of state same sex couples already will have married in massachusetts

8269714 as a result the los angeles democrat is missing her partys national convention in denver where she would love to be
8269715 instead she is here in sacramento negotiating the budget though not in meetings with her fellow legislative leaders and the governor
8269716 we have not had a meeting of the big 4 or the big 5 in about a week bass said
8269717 he is very clear that they republicans will not vote for taxes
8269718 the governor has said he wont sign a budget balanced with borrowing and senate president pro tem
8269719 he stood before the california delegation delivering a thundering speech for the party to unify behind presumptive nominee barack obama
8269720 then florez rushed off to catch a plane because things are far from unified back in the capitol in california
8269721 despite admonitions from outgoing senate leader don perata that all democrats must stay home to work through the state budget stalemate florez and fellow state sen
8269722 florez was returning in time for this weeks floor sessions but wasnt happy about it

8269725 despite his assurances mccain did not specify how he would mount a competitive effort in california a state no republican presidential candidate has won since
8269726 gov arnold schwarzenegger appeared at the fundraiser but did not speak mccain said the republican governor was right to chide previous national candidates for holding fundraisers in california while spending the money in battleground states
8269727 i also want to look you in the eye and i appreciate your generosity but i also want to tell you we will compete in the state of california mccain told donors
8269728 schwarzenegger has gone on offense for business by making several of their long stalled goals part of an
8269729 tellingly the chamber of commerce immediately endorsed schwarzeneggers latest proposal to bridge the budget deficit including a 1 cent increase in the sales tax on most taxable goods and some changes in tax treatment of business losses and left little doubt that the
8269730 all in all its entirely possible that for better or worse this could be a year in which business scores in its annual faceoff with liberal groups
8269731 under senate bill 375 the state would direct transportation funds to cities and counties that adopt general plans that comply with those goals
8269732 also home builders that build within those parameters could receive relief from preparing costly comprehensive environmental reviews and offered additional protections from litigation
8269733 opponents said the measure would usurp local control and cost jobs
8269734 the bipartisan 48 22 vote sent the legislation to the senate where its expected to pass
8269735 for the first time in the dozen years of turmoil since state voters legalized medical marijuana californias top law enforcement official stepped into the fray monday with new guidelines designed in part to quell the ongoing friction between the state and federal authorities
8269736 hopefully the feds will back off in instances where people are really following these guidelines brown said monday in a telephone interview
8269737 the guidelines affirm the legality of many of the states medical marijuana dispensaries but only those operated as collectives or cooperatives and not in business for profit
8269738 assembly bill 2321 which would exempt the proposed levy from the states sales tax cap needs the approval of the senate and the assembly by the end of the week when the legislative session ends said
8269739 it will then require the approval of gov arnold schwarzenegger though the governor has said he would not sign any bills until the legislature approves a new state budget
8269740 without the bill the ballot measure would push the countys already high sales tax above the legal limit
8269741 the new tax would generate a projected 40 billion for transportation projects over 30 years

8269743 proponents of the measure argue that america cannot turn away from a homegrown energy source at a time when the country is dangerously dependent on foreign oil and technology has made offshore oil drilling safer than ever
8269744 allow expanded oil exploration and extraction in the santa barbara county region
8269745 the vote is largely symbolic the supervisors have no power to approve new offshore drilling and schwarzenegger has already come out against it but it underscores both the issues volatility and this coastal countys changing profile
8269746 the number of existing single family houses that traded hands in july leaped an estimated 43 4 percent from a year ago the california association of realtors reported the median price however dropped 40 3 percent to 350 760 the biggest decline since the realtors began tracking the market

8269874 i think that showing this in cinemas can only add to the distress and grief felt by the de menezes family and the survivors of 7 7 and those who lost loved ones on that day
8269875 the hurt and pain doesnt go away overnight films like this only serve to stir up those painful memories
8269876 i feel the film paints a picture of the police as being incompetent and biased
8269877 but ultimately it wasnt the predictable plot or poor acting that caused offence to me but the cynical attempt to make money from a tragic event

8269885 as a gay man i know how it feels to be called hateful names simply because of who i am
8269886 i believe one of the unintended consequences of forbidding such words to be spoken is imbuing those words with more power than they should ever have and helping create the illusion that the bigotry and racism expressed by such cruel epithets is less prevalent than it actually is which we all know is sadly not the case
8269887 first i go by the one drop rule one drop of black blood and youre black the truth is every african american is bi racial go back far enough and youll find the massah was in the slave quarters
8269888 you cant be black and go to harvard law school you cant be black and be articulate the stereotype is that all black men are angry that if hes not angry hes not passionate i dont believe that
8269889 when hassam got this part he was going online to look up terrorist organisations and trying to surf the web and find all these things and he got an e mail saying why are you doing this why are you looking into this

8269902 that would imply its a boy so until we know well refer to it as two and a half people were beyond happy to be new parents together
8269903 we couldnt be more excited to add to our already big and happy family

8269919 it is what it is it s fine no crazy dramas going on
8269920 the word is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin
8269921 it is unfortunate that a major film studio would choose to exploit an ethnic slur as a sensational promotion for a movie mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimize and normalize anti muslim prejudice in our society
8269922 nationwide efforts by islamophobes who seek to deny muslims access to the political process
8269923 a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and allahs religion is made victorious over all other religions

8269935 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with gorbachev thats what nixon did with mao i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at the time when they were saying were going to wipe you off the planet

8269947 its our camelot to see a man like barack obama run such an amazing campaign is one thing but to see his dynamic pretty relatable black wife by his side is a huge make that huge plus in his column
8269948 that he does after his departure from the world when he becomes a spirit
8269949 at 1 50am two officers on routine patrol say they observed mr days car travelling at speed in the opposite direction while they stopped at a junction
8269950 they turned their police car round as mr day drove though a red light
8269951 they operated their blue light to bring his vehicle to a halt and they followed him they indicated him to stop which he did
8269952 he was unable to provide a breath sample at the roadside and they tried three times
8269953 but he sucked rather than blowed and was arrested he later provided a positive sample at the police station
8269954 im a husband and im a father and ive never done anything like this before
8269955 i was away on tour and missing my family that night i know you must hear this a lot but i hardly ever drink
8269956 i have never got behind the wheel of a car when ive had too much alcohol my only intention was to move my car off a yellow line
8269957 i realise i was endangering peoples lives and im truly sorry for that
8269958 one child lives four hours from where i live and to have no car would make it difficult for me to pick him up on weekends i can only throw myself on the mercy of the court
8269959 but i have taken into account the circumstances of the event and your guilty plea you appear to be genuinely contrite

8269966 no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8269967 even people with just a passing knowledge of the game or in countries where he never played will invariably recognise the name bradman as a by word for brilliance soccer has pele and cricket has bradman
8269968 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level
8269969 this centenary offers us an opportunity to reflect upon the role the don played in popularising the game through his attacking style of batting
8269970 a fear psychosis is being created to slow down certain projects of national importance this will be counter productive for the countrys economic growth its global image as well as our ability to attract investments from across the world

8269973 ik ken alle onderzoeken op dit gebied en nog nooit is aangetoond dat kort televisiekijken op zichzelf slecht is voor babys en peuters
8269974 we hebben nauwgezet geturfd hoe ze naar verschillende programmas kijken van de teletubbies tot het nieuws bij de teletubbies zaten babys van negen maanden al te schaterlachen dat is toch niet erg volwassenen ontspannen toch ook bij een grappig programma

8269978 we are optimistic that this is going to help more patients
8269979 the information held by the foreign secretary is not merely necessary but essential if binyam mohamed is to have his case fairly considered
8269980 we have generations of people that have passed through here when you come down with a friend or child or a grandchild their experience is going to be the same that it was for you and there arent too many places where you can do that anymore
8269981 you have to appreciate that there may be constitutional difficulties with that
8269982 private property is highly regarded in this country and to enter a private premises to do that is something we have to look at very carefully
8269983 weve put it in as part of the process if there are too many difficulties constitutional difficulties it may not be part of the legislation
8269984 there are many other steps that we can take and that is a fairly draconian one
8269985 if theres an alarm going off and its been going off all weekend people will say please turn that off

8269987 if it means a constitutional change it would be difficult to pursue if it doesnt then we can pursue it
8269988 in far too many cases when you have disturbance what people do is they contact the gardai if gardai are not authorised officers there is little can be done
8269989 if the garda are put in a position where they are authorised officers they can take immediate action and issue a fine

8269995 whatever underground is supposed to mean we do not know
8269996 we exceeded our financial targets despite the difficult situation on the financial markets profit continued to rise and returns remained stable
