1580212 farah was approached but she excused herself citing her triplets as the reason but the real reason she refused is deepika padukone khan doesnt want to work with her farah gave the newcomer a big break with om shanti om but the actress hasnt kept in touch beyond a few smses farah doesnt like deepikas attitude and being a very straightforward person it would be difficult for her to work with her for 10 days and pretend all was well so farah passed up on the offer
1580213 he went in had a brief conversation and shot the clerk
1580214 he has won over the confidence of the players he is a very good influence on the team he speaks to the point and doesnt command unnecessary attention the players like that about him
1580215 the thing that i liked about the last test win at galle was that there were contributions from everyone our process is long term short term results are gains that happen but we still believe in what we are doing we believe that we are going to win more than we lose in the process our goal is to see that the indian team is the best in the world by april next year
1580216 virender sehwag plays an attacking game since he has the skill and ability to play like that but for someone like rahul dravid we wouldnt want him to play like that

1580249 por lo tanto la posici n es clara desde esa perspectiva es l gico que se respeten las reglas que la familia ol mpica se ha dado m s all de cada deportista tenga su manera de pensar pero una cosa es que tenga su manera de pensar y otra que no respete las normas que est n establecidas

1580257 theyre working very very hard everyone here at the lewiston fire department is working a lot harder than i am today i hope to understand in some way what theyre doing and to honor their service to our county and community
1580258 if i have an opportunity not only to immerse myself into a community but also hang out with the workers understand their challenges facing their families and raising their families paying for healthcare and dealing with the skyrocketing cost of energy its very helpful for me to hear what people are saying firsthand
1580259 they go all over into the county i think theyre probably understaffed as i understand it but they do a great job with the paramedics they have they can treat something on the spot
1580260 balance and restorative justice is the premise that we work from
1580261 part of the restorative justice thing is repairing harm youve done to both the victim and the community which is why community service is such a big piece
1580262 they wash county vehicles clean up the detention center grounds we have them often times work over at the courthouse cleaning up and around other county buildings
1580263 their actions have consequences not only for them but for members of the community and the victims theyve perpetrated their crimes against
1580264 in doing this community service we also hope to install a work ethic the child maybe hadnt had before and an appreciation for hard work
1580265 between love and madness lies obession love madness its my secret

1580282 it is unlikely that additional spending cuts can be implemented in the short term
1580283 however the pressure to achieve cuts much greater than the planned 1bn for 2009 will now intensify even this year the governments announced spending curbs may not be sufficient to prevent the deficit exceeding the eu limit of 3pc of output gdp
1580284 ireland may not breach eu rules on deficits this year but it will be very tight
1580285 if new houses are not selling when they are completed there is no vat
1580286 the figures show that the slowdown has spread now from the housing market into the retail side and has impacted on consumer confidence
1580287 rising input costs in conjunction with weak demand are putting significant pressure on firms in the services sector
1580288 unsurprisingly given this background employment is contracting as firms seek to make cost savings

1580290 in formulating the precise claim in each bank we will of course factor in the particular circumstances of each business and the change agenda being sought by senior management however inflation proofing our members terms and conditions will underpin each claim

1580305 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1580306 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1580307 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1580308 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1580309 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1580310 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1580311 id like it if they like us but i dont think they like us

1580338 right now we have over 12 million users in over 26 countries with 240 million in transactions revenue so far with 180 million in the last 12 months alone
1580339 on average titles that have downloadable content on xbl marketplace have seen a 16 percent longer period of people holding onto that title which keeps them from selling to secondhand stores
1580340 when you submit your title to certification you want to make sure that you follow the process of submitting dlc with your title it doesnt have to be complete or feature ready but it allows verification your title is ready for dlc
1580341 its great if you can think about dlc from day one or at least as early as you can in the development cycle so there are no hiccups
1580342 as long as you have an understanding of what youd like to do having that in your dlc plan will help you right away
1580343 that title update whether or not you add or change anything to your spa will force all of the changes youve made so far to their gamer profile
1580344 only the users who download dlc will get new updates in between title updates
1580345 the main reason for that is because certs job is not to test your content its there to protect the content protect our users and protect the service we provide theres no functional testing ever done on dlc submissions the most that will ever be done is to make sure that content complies with the technical certification requirements
1580346 okay if its not functional and if its not feature rich it just needs to be consumed by the title and not crash
1580347 if youre going to be submitting it as sample content when that sample content is downloaded you could be level 1 as opposed to level 20
1580348 content should behave in a way when its on the system that makes it identifiable from content that ships on the disc
1580349 typically if the dlc is not present the game can continue without that as long as you inform the player why they might not have access
1580350 even with episodic content you should be able to play episode five without episode four present even if you played episode four before
1580351 first you want to make sure you have your paid downloadable content release strategy in place
1580352 in order to complete your offer its going to help to have an idea of the types of content you want to release the release cadence you want if you have multiple types of content and where you want to release it
1580353 we dont offer default descriptions for in game content we cant possibly anticipate the great ideas youll have for your dlc
1580354 this is what the user will be looking at on marketplace when making a purchasing decision if it includes new achievements make sure you absolutely get this in the description
1580355 lets say that for your multiplayer title you want to include six new characters for the game and release them as dlc what we need is to get the bits onto the other players boxes so they can see and interact with them but not use them
1580356 a great basic way to get the content in front of your user immediately is to use the showmarketplaceui function and show the user the content from within the game
1580357 a much better way to do that would be to call that blade and have this great new content be the only thing on the blade
1580358 think globally think about where the title is shipping not just where its shipping initially even if you dont have a publishing group in another region keep those regions in mind
1580359 games with paid downloadable content sell on average 21 million more at retail provided the dlc hits within a so called 30 day
1580360 right now we have over 12 million users in over 26 countries with 240 million in transactions revenue so far with 180 million in the last 12 months alone

1580372 2 the us election cycle is arguably the most powerful short term cycle operating in global markets today in the 26 months leading up to each election since 1900 93 of dow jones industrial gains have occurred in this period versus 7 in the 22 months post election look at any global index and you will see a similar impact it is interesting to note that the canadian toronto stock exchange tsx index a heavily commodity reliant index made 97 of its gains in the 26 month us pre election period versus 3 post election due to the ability of the us government and quasi government agencies like the fed to inflate economies leading up to elections which has historically had a powerful inflationary impact on commodities

1580376 my wife and i share a love of coffee when we first met she already had a little coffee machine and a mill we never disagree in matters of coffee
1580377 coffee is extremely complex it is second only to oil in global trade often the farmers best efforts cannot compensate for what a country is losing against the dollar
1580378 in the counties where coffee grows it is a crucial vehicle for education and all kinds of benefits

1580385 shape matters a lot in biology weve known that for years
1580386 there are a lot of chemotherapy drugs that are really toxic to the heart or the kidney
1580387 by controlling the size and shape we should be able to de target these organs
1580388 this is important for environmental scientists drug designers oncologists dermatologists inhalation any number of fields
1580389 nobody else is doing this its a huge unmet need
1580390 their small size means that they can get to places that other things cant

1580392 aluminum in ordinary amounts is something we use every day but nano sized aluminum is highly explosive

1580399 but instinct makes you want to save them and for me thats a good thing

1580409 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1580410 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1580411 yes there are problems but that does not mean those problems are going to continue
1580412 in all developing countries you put objectives and sometimes you dont reach them
1580413 they are determined to spend this money on development they see it as a priority
1580414 its exactly the role of the council to overrule him in a case like this
1580415 i do believe he ought to put more money into this project to show his sincerity that hes going to get it done
1580416 i think we need to honor the original request and let him pay for the traffic improvements when he pays for the land
1580417 i think this is going to be a great project and im glad the council is eager to work with us
1580418 the consequence could be that a citizen could bring some sort of legal action to stop them from doing it
1580419 right now as a county commissioner i get what all the employees get
1580420 its not like i was asking them to give me the 200 bucks a month
1580421 if i try to buy an individual policy with pre existing health conditions i couldnt do it
1580422 if its illegal the department of justice has to stop it or get the legislature to pass a law and make it legal
1580423 it always sort of bugged me that they thought they were better than every other political official in north carolina
1580424 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1580425 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1580426 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1580427 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1580428 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1580429 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1580430 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1580431 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1580432 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1580433 they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true
1580434 new nvidia gtx 200 graphics architecture is just as interesting as the recently announced ati radeon hd 4800 that is why it deserves thorough and detailed discussion today we are going to talk about the results of synthetic benchmarks obtained from gainward geforce gtx 280 and leadtek geforce gtx 260

1580442 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1580443 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
1580444 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
1580445 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
1580446 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1580447 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1580448 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
1580449 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1580450 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1580451 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1580452 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1580453 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1580454 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1580455 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1580456 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1580457 in the light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high
1580458 you can make the argument that the inflation risks are a little less than in june and the growth outlook a little worse
1580459 we are starting to see signs that consumers are pulling back even faster than we expected we thought the tax rebates would really boost consumption in the third quarter and we are not seeing that
1580460 yes to date season five has been outperforming season four
1580461 all very heartening but again i caution fans from assuming a decision on the shows sixth season will be solely ratings based
1580462 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate than dr jha
1580463 sanjay jha is very well connected in the mobile industry and knows the challenges facing him taking on that role is a hugely daunting task but i think he has the personality to pull the company forward
1580464 im going to take about 90 days working with the team here
1580465 i dont come here without any ideas i have very strong ideas but ill be working with a team here to determine what are the right next steps on the chipsets and platforms strategies
1580466 can be the lee iacocca of the mobile industry bringing an iconic brand back to life if it goes south he can say sorry this thing was so messed up when i got there that there was nothing i could do
1580467 and of course theres always a desi angle interestingly it turns out that jhas an impressive leader indeed and apparently very versatile if you google his name youll find that in addition to being a whiz in telecom praan jaye par shaan na jaye
1580468 figure of a gigantic tomato borne on the shoulders of two men
1580469 warhols mother served him tomato soup for lunch for twenty years which was why he painted tomato soup cans
1580470 i used to drink it i used to have the same lunch every day for twenty years i guess the same thing over and over again
1580471 campbells for dinner for supper for lunch eating this soup is what gives me the punch
1580472 it was fun to make and better tasting than i thought it would be

1580475 looking at madonna i kept thinking of the british expression for reconditioning a saddle having it restuffed
1580476 it s possible though in some cases before and after pictures would seem to suggest otherwise that this face is occurring entirely naturally after all these are women who are famous for being beautiful
1580477 the point is that there is a noticeable aesthetic shift happening in the face and that s dovetailing with quantum leaps in plastic surgery and dermatology
1580478 by reporting the lives of the rich and the famous who work hard and party hard page 3 serves as an aspiration model for those who want to be like the page 3 celebrities in life
1580479 we mostly deal with subjects that youngsters would like to read about in our city supplements home to the celebrity pages
1580480 serious issues fun and games page 3 is not just wishful thinking if its there it is because a large part of the society wants to read it
1580481 and as a peoples representative i dont want to be a hypocrite these pages are serving a purpose they are dedicated to the high society who want to know all that is happening in their social circuits
1580482 so whats wrong with page 3 it fits into the way newspapers package their contents
1580483 it is socialist thinking page 3 touches the aspirational nerve of society
1580484 it must have a little bit of spice that can spice up everyones life after all newspapers are family products
1580485 i definitely would not want a dj speaking about bomb blasts this is what page 3 tends to do sometimes we should talk to people relevant to it
1580486 but the information is sketchy at times it can certainly be improved and imparted in depth page 3 should be meaningfully light

1580526 theres likely to be a huge position in this direction and symantecs positioning itself to take advantage of it
1580527 what matters most is how well you walk through fire
1580528 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1580529 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1580530 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1580531 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1580532 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1580533 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1580534 so obviously very large earthquakes this close to the high rise district are of concern
1580535 usc would go up a meter or two relative to the area just south of the los angeles coliseum downtown and everything north of usc would also be lifted by a meter or two

1580551 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1580552 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1580553 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1580554 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1580555 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1580556 of course i would have liked to have been there advocating for a peaceful resolution
1580557 mr marshall has not been convicted nor charged with a crime
1580558 its not enough to simply avoid being found guilty of a crime instead as an employee of the nfl or a member club you are held to a higher standard persons who fail to live up to this standard are guilty of conduct detrimental and subject to discipline even where the conduct itself does not result in conviction of a crime
1580559 i get to appeal to the guy who imposed the discipline
1580560 i am assuming the nfl will send out another press release to tell us
1580561 i told him we would appeal it and hes anxious to have some modicum of due process
1580562 he doesnt deserve any of that because he is not a bad guy
1580563 you hear stuff about what the other guys are doing he is out here working hard and he is ready to go

1580573 magrieta was standing on a chair next to her house and trying to call to him over the wall
1580574 i called magrieta and she ran towards me the scaffolding collapsed she could have died
1580575 moments before the accident i was standing on the chair right next to the wall my neighbour said something was falling and i ran off if i hadnt run so quickly then i wouldve been stuck because things wouldve blocked my way

1580584 were working with colleagues in china and japan on follow up studies to determine whether this physical response can be measured in other seismically active regions
1580585 provided the effect is pervasive we still need to learn more about the timing of the signals if we are to reliably use them to warn of impending quakes
1580586 what is so surprising is that rapid almost sudden changes take place in the earths magnetic field
1580587 it is in this region that the shielding effect of the magnetic field is severely reduced thus allowing high energy particles of the hard radiation belt to penetrate deep into the upper atmosphere to altitudes below a hundred kilometers 62 miles
1580588 thank goodness the military scientists do not understand these titanic forces and have not tried to think of a way to use them as military weapons
1580589 but that presumes a straight line and i think mother nature hates straight lines she prefers curves being female ahem

1580594 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1580595 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1580596 we have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law
1580597 the supreme court has ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules
1580598 its silence is no surprise the united states has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access

1580646 jesus is wearing a red robe and blue cloak and this character is wearing the opposite it suggests leonardo is trying to say that mary magdalene was at the last supper sitting next to jesus as his other half
1580647 if you divide the word sangraal after the g it means blood royal
1580648 and you dont carry the blood royal in a jar it flows in the blood of a child
1580649 mary magdalene is the most important woman in world history
1580650 not for what she did but because church fathers were so afraid of her image
1580651 shes feisty shes assertive she annoyed the male disciples immensely because she had such power over jesus
1580652 the whole of history the way that the church has treated its women is actually because of their terror of mary magdalene

1580716 hajat untuk ke luar negara datang dari dalam diri saya sendiri dan saya memilih rusia adalah di atas pilihan saya sendiri
1580717 dan mengapa saya memilih untuk ke rusia kerana di samping untuk belajar perubatan di sana tetapi juga kerana ingin mencabar iman yang ada dalam diri saya ini ayah saya selalu cerita tentang rusia tentang komunis kesusahan umat islam disana dalam mempertahankan keimanan mereka kerana itu saya memilih rusia sebagai destinasi ilmu saya ilmu agama yang ada dalam diri ini saya ingin mencabarnya sejauh mana saya beriman kepada allah sejauh mana saya mengaku cinta pada allah sejauh mana saya mengaku quran sebagai sumber rujukan saya soalan soalan inilah yang membawa saya untuk mencabar diri saya untuk melihat sejauh mana saya boleh berpegang dan mengamalkan agama yang ada pada diri ini ketika suasana mencengkam diri ini ketika biah atau suasana tidak membantu dalam mengamalkan islam adakah saya berupaya untuk mengekalkan kehidupan beragama inilah penyebab mengapa saya memilih ke rusia dengan kata lain saya memilih untuk berada di negara muslim sebagai minority

1580801 i went wow this is a great way to start this defensive campaign

1580803 if i knew i wouldnt be coaching right now id be a sports psychologist charging some exorbitant fee
1580804 were much further ahead night and day from where we were a year ago as far as the football team being a team
1580805 were going to do it well and were going to do it fast
1580806 it was the first day in pads and to be honest it was the first day i have been disappointed with the energy effort and enthusiasm that we had
1580807 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
1580808 it is kind of strange for a large predator like that to come that close to the house
1580809 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1580810 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1580811 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead

1580817 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1580818 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1580819 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest

1580821 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets

1580831 at this point he provided essentially no biographical data about himself before 1993
1580832 we want to find out if he is indeed christopher chichester

1580834 our experience tells us hes more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory
1580835 he loves his daughter kidnapping doesnt apply it was his own kid
1580836 just because hes reighs natural father it doesnt absolve him

1580856 looking back it was the thing in his life that shamed him the most the times he was purposefully calculatingly mean to alice it was those moments and there had been many of them that indicated to him that he was not a good person he got mad at her for many things but it was always really for the same thing that she possessed his love and he couldnt seem to get it back she didnt deserve it which was to say she deserved better

1580938 that is not to say however that the constitution is an inflexible and static document it is a living constitution with built in procedures for its amendments or revision that will bring back to the people for approval such amendments or revision to meet the needs and aspirations of the filipino people any agreement which runs counter to the provisions of the constitution or goes beyond its framework needs to go through the tedious process of amending or revising the constitution through a proposal made by a constitutional convention called by congress or a proposal made by congress by itself acting as a constituent assembly or a proposal by peoples initiative and approval or ratification of the proposal by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite conducted throughout the philippines

1581012 is a techno geeky way to say flexible glitch free audio
1581013 the redesigned pulseaudio automatically adjusts the way it feeds audio data to accommodate system load and ensure the audio data is always ready when needed
1581014 somewhat one size fits all design that was not nearly as flexible
1581015 the way audio data flowed could be affected to a much greater degree by particular hardware devices or audio software applications

1581017 any of a number of scripting languages such as the bash shell python or perl making it completely extensible
1581018 the goal stick more keywords up into the url and remove the faff which nobody uses to make the url search engine and people attractive having keywords in your url is an absolute must especially when its as easy as wordpress makes it
1581019 the goal is to help search engine crawlers move through your website collecting information to be stored in the search engines database the key to your blogs data making it successfully into a search engines database is to 1 make sure there are no road blocks in the path of a search engine crawler 2 make sure the crawler can move through your blog examining all your web pages 3 provide adequate keywords and key phrases which clearly help categorize your content 4 provide clearly labeled tags and categories recognized by tagging service crawlers and many search engines today 5 take advantage of pinging services
1581020 movable type is optimized quite well out of the box but there are a few quick tricks to easily providing the spiders with some dynamic content
1581021 for my main home page and category index pages i hardcode most of my meta data your meta tags will be at the top of the template within the tag you can get fancy on your index pages but i cannot really see why optimize these two templates by hand for whatever keywords you are targeting site wide
1581022 blogrolling inbound links are gold but in googles eyes not all links are equal in particular google isnt wild about links contained within javascript apparently they can index them but that doesnt mean they always want to
1581023 there are people in town who think there are some inequities
1581024 we need to look at that sooner rather than later
1581025 wegmans isnt going to be up and selling anything within the next 24 months so theres plenty of time to go through the same process with other stores if its a legitimate request
1581026 that way is too complicated and expensive in my mind
1581027 once you have the authority to issue a sort of license like a tavern license there will be continuous interest expressed in getting those licenses it takes up time and the board has to say no and come up with legitimate reasons why it can say no each time
1581028 it took a lot of physical therapy to get it moving again

1581031 i could see the bone inside my finger school officials found pieces of my skin hanging from a rusted broken link
1581032 nicole did a fantastic job testifying in front of the committee
1581033 i cant think of any other sport where this type of object that is so inherently dangerous is in the field of play safety considerations for these kids should be paramount
1581034 if we can save one child from going through the tragedy that nicole has endured it is clearly worthwhile
1581035 the sensory trail not only provides an opportunity for the visually impaired to experience nature by themselves if they care to it also provides context for each of us to understand nature more carefully by using all of our senses

1581043 i was cold to start off but then i got it back i wasnt too worried
1581044 because many prostate cancers grow slowly early detection may not benefit a patients health and in some cases may even cause harm
1581045 id love to have contracts now but obviously were locked into these discussions now and well see where it goes
1581046 when criminals are able to breach security systems they have enormous ability to cause harm millions of americans have had their identities compromised each year the annual costs to american citizens and businesses are in the billions

1581054 the nhs 130c model pairs a top of the line home theater system with whole home automation that can be fully integrated and installed in a fraction of the time normally required for custom installers to build and integrate the system themselves
1581055 because the system is already pre racked and pre integrated installation becomes extremely simple saving integrators significant time and money
1581056 incorporating control4s leading controller and operating system into sonys pre integrated home theater system brings practical easy to use home automation solutions to any residence
1581057 we are extremely pleased to work closely with sony on this innovative approach to simplify installation and bring to life the digital home for a broader market of homes
1581058 as the industry has awarded recognition for control4s home automation innovation this first third party product designed specifically for control4 is a welcome addition to our ecosystem our control4 partner program is designed to support such third party manufacturers as card access to easily integrate their devices to work across control4 automation systems
1581059 the inhome wireless contact switch is perfect for new home construction and retrofit home automation
1581060 from a recessed basement room to the edge of the homeowners property the wireless contact switch adds automated features to almost any contact sensor the home automation installer uses today and does it with batteries and without the need for the wire we really extend the benefits and enjoyment of the control4 automated home into new applications where running a wire just isnt practical or possible

1581112 were dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon

1581114 with housing affordability at a low interest rate concern at a high and the rental squeeze beginning to pinch it is intriguing to uncover the demographics and inclinations of todays first homebuyer to be
1581115 we know that many are increasingly determined to beat the affordability challenge and purchase their own piece of the country while others are becoming disheartened
1581116 every option whether it is saving more waiting longer making more sacrifices buying with others or something different should be considered before putting property purchase plans on hold
1581117 its a reality that in order to achieve the great australian dream of owning your own home sacrifices will be necessary
1581118 regardless it could be said that having to make sacrifices is a positive step because it helps people to understand the reality of a mortgage before they commit to one

1581122 i can confirm that monika will not be taking part in the games because she failed a dope test at home
1581123 we are actually relieved it happened before she reached here because it would have shamed the country if she had failed a test at the olympics
1581124 i cant understand why athletes think they can get away with it because strict measures are in place to find drug cheats
1581125 we in india have strict rules on doping it wont be tolerated i hope the athlete and the concerned federation are punished
1581126 there were instances when some people had been let off in the past
1581127 that was shameful but this time we will not allow any doping scandal we are keeping en eye on all athletes
1581128 we want to send out the message that no one will be spared if proved guilty
1581129 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
1581130 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
1581131 i could just tell from his body language when the camera panned on him that something wasnt quite right watching him at edgbaston last week i felt the same thing i know him very well because weve been through some hard times together as well as some very exciting ones but he was never like this it was as if he had lost the fight
1581132 i think he feels with this decision made he can now relax and enjoy his cricket again and everybody plays better when he is enjoying himsef im sure that we havent heard the last of michael vaughan
1581133 the captain feels a little less pressure if he is performing well there have been times when i have struggled and felt the pressure as a leader to ask a lot of your players all the time when youre not performing well is a big thing
1581134 vaughan should have waited there is one test match left in the current series england are 2 0 down and cannot now get back on terms but they can use the final match to restore a bit of the collective pride that went missing at edgbaston on saturday evening and it was vaughans responsibility to help them achieve it
1581135 in my view michael went too soon and should have waited until after the tour of india i think hes still a terrific player just one innings away from resurrecting his form the timing is never right it tends to be when youve lost a series pressure from outside had built up and obviously hed reached the time to say enough is enough
1581136 probably for the last time in his life the stage belonged to vaughan he was emotional humble funny and honest as he reflected upon what he will realise in time to have been the greatest days of his professional life he thanked his team the back room staff the professional cricketers association the fans and most movingly of all his family no michael thank you
1581137 i take no pleasure in seeing michael go and i dont think anyone else should hes a nice lad he has done a fine job for england but i think the captaincy a lack of runs and loss of confidence have all got to him in the end its better to go now with dignity than just hang on
1581138 people sometimes forget the pressure that being england captain puts on your family and home life especially when things are not going well they would have been watching and reading lots of things to do with michael and after a while it is tough to take so i think he has probably made the right decision
1581139 vaughan has paid the price for an old malaise the self satisfaction of english cricket it is a complacent culture in which many though not all do enough to maintain their own position but rarely go the extra mile
1581140 perhaps he should have gone earlier but proud men do not give in easily the certainty is that it could go on no longer it was time for someone else to carry the can
1581141 if i had carried on another month it would have been a month wasted for the next man vaughan and if he had hung on until after the oval that would have wasted a week when the next man could have been using it to settle in
1581142 with vaughans departure we can be sure of only one thing the legacy of that glorious summer of 2005 has now been well and truly squandered
1581143 enakan nggak usah ngerjakan perintah agama dong kan nggak ada hukumannya

1581329 my friends started working when youre young and start making 500 a week or more and live with your parents life is nice and easy thats why not a lot of hispanics go to college
1581330 some just didnt want to try though the talent is out there
1581331 i applied to all these colleges i had to take the act three times and i couldnt get in even though i played soccer well
1581332 i was scared getting into it i didnt think i was capable of doing it even while i was there i didnt know if this is what i wanted to do
1581333 i go talk about my whole experience and tell kids not to be in gangs or into drugs
1581334 on the team im the only hispanic so im the mexican guy when we do marketing and pass out fliers they turn to me and say you go to pilsen some of them even think i was born in mexico
1581335 its much different now and most of my friends are not hispanic theyre english bosnian african black and white

1581338 in the future i think there are going to be more mexicans more hispanics going to college hispanics never give up they always want more but the percentage is not high enough yet people need to know if you have a dream you follow it

1581348 he should have not done that to you and made you be quiet going through that referring to my miscarriage you needed someone to help you and give you support during that time and it made me think she was right
1581349 yes but we put safeguards in place to protect people
1581350 we are now requiring a homeowner to get third party counseling before signing we capped the origination fees to 6 000 and no homeowner will be required to buy other financial products
1581351 protect seniors from unscrupulous lenders who may use deception and fraud to strip seniors of nearly a lifetimes worth of equity

1581353 an effort to develop a systematic approach to open the doors of education employment and business development opportunities to qualified individuals who happen to be members of groups that have experienced long standing and persistent discrimination the purpose of which is to give our nation a way to finally address the systemic exclusion of individuals of talent on the basis of their gender or race from opportunities to develop perform achieve and contribute
1581354 to create a more inclusive society that provides genuine equality of opportunity
1581355 oh well theyre only there because they needed a token
1581356 it was in spring training in 2006 when i first started with the white sox that my daughter got sick
1581357 she started throwing up she threw up like four times and we were like wow thats weird so we took her to the er at the hospital the doctor immediately checked her glucose levels and her sugar level was really high thats how we found out she went from like a perfectly normal child to sick in a matter of hours it was pretty hard news
1581358 before it happened she was drinking a lot of water and going to the bathroom a lot which are the main symptoms but we didnt know
1581359 the doctor told us her pancreas just stopped working and that it was nothing we did we didnt give her too much candy or sugar
1581360 it was really tough at the beginning because she didnt know she was only two years old and lucky for us we got her an insulin pump with a skin catheter so we didnt have to give her a shot
1581361 when we go out we always have to be prepared we have to carry extra stuff just in case
1581362 when she goes to school well have to prepare when we go to a birthday party or whatever well have to be aware of the amount of cake she eats well just have to make sure we dont make any mistakes
1581363 my mom was always helping others and this is just the way for us to do the same
1581364 when we come to kids every medical expert would agree that something needs to be done parents need to be more aware of what the calories are
1581365 there is such a thing as going too far to prove a point
1581366 tan serias tan responsables y metidas en sus cochazos oficiales
1581367 nearly a dozen nahj members were laid off this year
1581368 the layoffs affected print and broadcast journalists just entering the field and veterans this is devastating news as a journalist of color
1581369 i was shocked when i was told i was being laid off i didnt think it would happen to me on our design desk theres four or five of us over 50 and im the youngest i was also the only hispanic on the design desk i was expecting to receive an envelope with the buyout option like everybody else but instead i got a bigger envelope telling me my position was eliminated i couldnt believe it ive seen two young hispanics both in their early 20s lose their jobs because of the last in first out concept
1581370 at the moment i think diversity has been thrown out the window in newsrooms across the country this is now a business and the company has to make money ive been told that the star telegram makes money and is one of the top producers in the mcclatchy chain but apparently we arent making enough i only hope that they consider keeping as diverse staff as possible when they are making their cuts
1581371 our stories will be told if its newsworthy and if theres space to do it the stories will likely be shorter and probably wont appear as often as they should and they may not be told by hispanic reporters
1581372 we want to talk to people we want to get a first hand view of whats happening there
1581373 true identity theft is two parts when someone steals an id and then uses it to commit some felonious act
1581374 werent even valid numbers whose id did they steal and is that the correct use of immigration and customs enforcement resources 900 agents and dozens of lawyers for guarding against the threat of terrorism where are the terrorists
1581375 if hundreds of americans had flocked to iowa and said yay now i can have a job it would be different
1581376 no american should ever be denied a job but where are they the bigger question is this the solution you have for the 12 million illegal immigrants here to work rounding people up in shackles in a cow pasture is this the reputation we want as a nation
1581377 its wrong to deny these people their day in court but they knew they had their prey and that their prey was weak
1581378 employers who break the law and hire illegal immigrants do not pay
1581379 the effect of illegal immigration overpopulation congestion urban sprawl pollution

1581381 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
1581382 in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him
1581383 sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
1581384 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him
1581385 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth
1581386 no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him
1581387 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
1581388 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
1581389 there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
1581390 god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him
1581391 the glory which i had with thee before the world was
1581392 declared to be the son of god with power by the resurrection from the dead
1581393 hath raised up jesus again as it is also written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee
1581394 spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things
1581395 fear not that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god
1581396 the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise
1581397 there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
1581398 and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace
1581399 wherefore he is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him
1581400 no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states

1581410 listen im sorry if youre bored this trip isnt about entertaining you its so all of us can spend some time with my parents and grandparents and do something nice for them because they arent going to be around much longer
1581411 my view and the view of the british chain of command is that the americans use of violence is not proportionate and is over responsive to the threat they are facing they dont see the iraqi people the way we see them they view them as untermenschen they are not concerned about the iraqi loss of life in the way the british are
1581412 when us troops are attacked with mortars in baghdad they use mortar locating radar to find the firing point and then attack the general area with artillery even though the area they are attacking may be in the middle of a densely populated residential area
1581413 they may well kill the terrorists in the barrage but they will also kill and maim innocent civilians that has been their response on a number of occasions it is trite but american troops do shoot first and ask questions later
1581414 the us will have to abandon the sledgehammer to crack a nut approach it has failed
1581415 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1581416 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1581417 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1581418 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1581419 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1581420 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling
1581421 perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1581422 due to the huge success of dance my summer will be taken up by travels to south africa australia and canada to work on local versions of the show

1581426 it is important for all landowners and residents to achieve a common ground in objecting to the kl draft plan your lands are only worth a lot as a whole

1581432 the idea is to provide its dwellers with quality living so that kampung baru is not seen as a slum amid a modern city overlooking the world famous petronas twin towers at the kuala lumpur city centre
1581433 at the same time we want its dwellers to be properly compensated so as to be able to live comfortably within the golden triangle
1581434 if need be we will request city hall to extend the deadline so that kampung baru is developed without encroaching on the rights of the malays
1581435 lets make it a joint effort irrespective of which political party we represent be it umno pas or parti keadilan rakyat
1581436 the future of kampung baru with selangor or city hall
1581437 we are roping in the local boys as we believe they will do the job wholeheartedly rather than have outsiders who will be out to reap just profits
1581438 this way kampung baru as a whole area will have better property value if you break it down into plots you will devalue your property

1581455 back in the days when i was a teenager before i had status and before i had a pager you could find the abstract listening to hip hop my pops used to say it reminded him of bebop
1581456 so jet to the store and buy the lp on j i v e unfortunately
1581457 we did this record on our own paid for it ourselves with no expectations of what was going to happen with it if it was even going to be finished let alone released
1581458 i still see myself as more of a music fan than a professional musician
1581459 to get to play with wilco as a wilco fan
1581460 i mean were not wilcos peers at all you know
1581461 that kind of vocal based music is what ive most listened to since i was a tot i mean ive gone through periods of writing that werent as harmony based but just in terms of recording this lp the process kind of determined what the band is almost we were just laying down all these ideas straight to tape some songs never having played live and we just determined it made sense to have the whole record come from this same place and have a lot of similar singing things going on
1581462 scarves of red tied round their throats to keep their little heads from falling in the snow
1581463 to me one of the pitfalls of revivalism is that youre speaking outside your own experience
1581464 and we get inspiration from everywhere but we are mindful of expressing ourselves and our own ideas some people may interpret it as old or new but its just coming from us
1581465 ive found that if i tried to write something specifically new sounding it somehow diluted what i was doing if you are not the lucky dude with the right sensibility that youre totally brand new and everyone hears it as new then the best thing to do ive found is to write songs you think are ok and not really worry about sounding old or new
1581466 but i really feel like this current group of people feels like the creative beings that should be doing this ive never been part of a creative synergy thats this strong ever
1581467 casey and i are both wearing keys that go into the death switch
1581468 yeah its the kill switch for robin so when its that time its like its over
1581469 yo can i take it back to where it all started
1581470 it was hard for me to perform the first song because when i see 100 000 people singing along theres only one person i could think of whos missing tonight
1581471 this performance is for my mama the woman who drove me to chicago at the age of 3 and said baby
1581472 sesquiidrato sono 1 5 molecole d acqua quindi le torna che 18 per 1 5 d 27 no
1581473 che faccia 27 ok ma perch per forza 1 5 non potrebbe essere un pochino di pi
1581474 ha ragione lei ha ragione lei abbiamo finito si rende conto
1581475 look what all i have to do for you people
1581476 should i tell you an excellent trick to stay awake
1581477 okay add three spoonfuls of salt in a glass of water
1581478 take a sharp knife make a slight cut to the tip of your finger and then dip it in the glass
1581479 i felt bad we didnt mean to hurt anyones feelings we didnt mean for it to be hurtful
1581480 i wish i had a lot of time to write a flowery long post but since im teaching and things are nuts and ive got lots to do ill put it bluntly its been three years since my last suicide attempt
1581481 what would i be doing today if i only had 37 days to live
1581482 but once it gets down to nitty gritty and german and russian businessmen deal with the details of their contracts misconceptions and prejudices are usually removed very fast it s a new situation for the german business community to deal with russian partners on this scale
1581483 and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me whoever finds his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it

1581488 tu sei una scimmia e tutti questi sono scimmie come te
1581489 retiree fees ought to relate to how much the plan is worth
1581490 the higher value plans should have higher premiums associated with them
1581491 they ought to reflect how much income an individual has so that if they make more money and are therefore better able to pay for a system they should do so
1581492 when tricare started out in 1995 members retirees were charged 230 per individual 460 per family
1581493 today in 2008 theyre charged 230 per individual 460 per family
1581494 essentially what this says to you is that we are asking our older retirees who are in fact the least likely to hold jobs and therefore have the lowest incomes to pay the most for their system
1581495 we believe we need to get some parity between our older and our younger retirees
1581496 we believe that the under 65 retirees should begin paying 40 percent of the medicare part b premium using the same fee structure that is laid on by the medicare system
1581497 in addition we believe that the under 65 retirees who elect to use tricare standard and extra need to pay a small fee for that
1581498 and we would suggest to the department that that fee be set at 15 percent of the medicare part b we think the family rate should be set at double the individual rate and that the premium increase needs to be phased in over four years

1581547 in 1792 mary birkett a dublin quaker published a poem on the african slave trade addressed to her own sex in two parts the poem is noteworthy for the way in which it urges other women to boycott slave produced goods sugar and rum in protest against slavery marys poem was written at a particular juncture in the abolition campaign publication of parts i and ii may have coincided with the passage of the 1792 abolition bill through the house of commons in april and the lords in may june part ii contains an address to members of the house of lords at this point george harrison published an address to the right reverend the prelates of england and wales on the subject of the slave trade furthermore by 1792 abstention had really come into its own as an abolitionist tactic in 1791 william fox a baptist had published an address to the people of great britain on the propriety of abstaining from west indian sugar and rum other pamphlets advocating abstention were published or reprinted in dublin in 1792 thousands gave up sugar in their tea and boycotted other slave produced goods including people mary knew in ireland one original contribution of her poem is the way she appeals to womens sense of solidarity as sisters utilising the contemporary construction of woman as the tender sex to argue that this sensibility far from excusing inaction entails greater responsibility women are not innocent or powerless they have an important share in causing slaves suffering through their own consumption and power to effect change by refusing slave produced goods and influencing their menfolk to do the same

1581559 phillis wheatley accomplishments aside and they are impressive she is not considered the first published african american poet in america that title goes to jupiter hammon
1581560 the actual study of multicultural literature has come about gradually during the past three decades a student in a representative university in the late 1960s might have come upon one or two writers at most in his american literature survey course this was linked as always to the publishing industry to what publishers in the united states were issuing less than to racism and elitism the first challenge within the academic community was to successfully argue the case for ethnic literature in the curriculum the second was to convince publishers of the merits of this body of work alice walker author of the color purple and many other books has recalled reading a photocopy version of hurstons landmark novel in graduate school and wondering why she had never heard of it and moreover why it wasnt available anywhere in print
1581561 african american literature is the body of literature produced in the united states by writers of african descent the genre traces its origins to the works of such late 18th century writers as phillis wheatley and olaudah equiano reaching early high points with slave narratives and the harlem renaissance and continuing today with authors such as toni morrison maya angelou and walter mosley being ranked among the top writers in the united states among the themes and issues explored in african american literature are the role of african americans within the larger american society african american culture racism slavery and equality african american writing has also tended to incorporate within itself oral forms such as spirituals sermons gospel music blues and rap as african americans place in american society has changed over the centuries so too have the foci of african american literature before the american civil war african american literature primarily focused on the issue of slavery as indicated by the subgenre of slave narratives at the turn of the 20th century books by authors such as w e b dubois and booker t washington debated whether to confront or appease racist attitudes in the united states during the american civil rights movement authors such as richard wright and gwendolyn brooks wrote about issues of racial segregation and black nationalism today african american literature has become accepted as an integral part of american literature with books such as roots the saga of an american family by alex haley the color purple by alice walker and beloved by toni morrison achieving both best selling and award winning status
1581562 1 there are it seems some differences of opinion even among scholars about where the study of black written poetry begins some like hughes and bontemps in the poetry of the negro begin with lucy terry but the negro caravan by brown davis and lee omits her altogether and opens with phillis wheatley william h robinson acknowledges terry in early black
1581563 disagree as to when the harlem renaissance began and ended
1581564 the harlem renaissance also known as the black literary renaissance and the new negro movement refers to the flowering of african american cultural and intellectual life during the 1920s and 1930s
1581565 75 novels poems autobiographies and essays along with summaries of the selected literature
1581566 the start of the harlem renaissance a period of creativity among black artists writers musicians and entertainers
1581567 with the slowing of african american writing during the great depression african americans confronted many new challenges and obstacles
1581568 a very transitional period for the united states and for african americans the forties was marked by more african american enlisting in all branches of the military and the start of world war ii during this time period african americans were fighting for the right to enlist in combat roles in the armed forces at this time blacks were primarily segregated and assigned only in noncombat roles whites responded to black demands with lynchings town burnings and other forms of violence the authors during this period continued the tradition of race and socially conscious writing literature with black themes of struggle oppression and daily life were often found in the works of the african american authors
1581569 a very politically unstable time for african americans their rights were constantly under attack all the efforts made during the forties to integrate the armed forces were abolished during the korean war a new era of racist assassinations began to occur and african americans started to take a stand against blatant racism the naacp argued cases in southern states against the discriminatory practices in public schools in may of 1954 the brown vs board of education occurred this case ruled racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional the african american non violent movement began taking the form of boycotts sit ins and peaceful protests the african american authors during this decade were writing about love discrimination the prison system protest black sexuality and black life in harlem
1581570 considered by many to be the second black renaissance it was african americans most significant decade in terms of self consciousness goals and achievements in contrast the harlem renaissance was in part fostered by white patrons and declined when whites financial support declined after the crash of 1929 but the 1960s was self generating self determining and self sustaining many significant events occurred during the 1960s such as the march on washington countless civil right demonstrations the sixties also saw the assassination of two black americas greatest leaders rev martin luther king jr and malcolm x new cries of black nationalism black separatism and violent resistance were often heard in african american communities the authors during this time addressed such themes as black pride self actualization black sexuality justice and race relations
1581571 a time when african culture was adopted by african americans the u s government began to monitor black organizations vietnam war ended and many african americans soldiers faced many disappointments many black soldiers found that their lives were not improved by fighting in a war that was not theirs shirley chisolm became the first black woman to run for the u s presidency the seventies saw the emergence of an open and ongoing discussion among black men and women on the quality forms and future of their relationships african american authors still voiced their frustrations and desires in their writings but many authors wrote about the same literary themes as in the sixties
1581572 a time in history when reganomics had expanded the gap in the economy to the point that poverty among blacks was at an all time high crack had hit the african american community harder than any other drug in the past martin luther king jr s birthday was established as a national holiday and jesse jackson ran for president the eighties was a time when female authors burst onto the scene publishing companies witnessed the enhancement of established talent among african american female writers these writers became apart of americas pop culture and started to float in societys mainstream african american authors discussed themes such as black female male relationships self identity and more authors had female main characters depicted in their works
1581573 much in the achievements of jupiter hammon of long island and lucy terry prince of massachusetts and vermont offers food for comparison the pioneer black poet and poetess share race and literary priority as well as social status as chattel property in 18th century america hammon has already received a measure of recognition as the first published african american poet with his broadside an evening thought salvation by christ with penetential cries in 1761 hammons fame nevertheless rests on but seven poems and four prose pieces discovered eightyseven years ago lucy terry prince on the other hand is credited with but a single poem composed fourteen years before hammon although not until recently recognized as the first poetry by any black american both hammon and prince however have been overshadowed by phillis wheatley whose precocity attracted attention in her own time and won for her contemporary literary recognition here and abroad there are it seems some differences of opinion even among scholars about where the study of black written poetry begins some like hughes and bontemps in the poetry of the negro begin with lucy terry but the negro caravan by brown davis and lee omits her altogether and opens with phillis wheatley william h robinson acknowledges terry in early black
1581574 this is the theory given in the vast majority of poe biographies although it cannot be proven true
1581575 coincidences in general are great stumbling blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration
1581576 and i submit to you that if a man has not discovered something that he will die for he isnt fit to live
1581577 if we should ever get to heaven we shall find nobody to reproach us for being black or for being slaves
1581578 the actual death date of jupiter hammon is not known because no one can find a death certificate or the exact spot of his burial
1581579 whether this is a complement or an insult ultimately it serves only one purpose that is to make conversion of hindus to christian more easier all christian charity all their acceptance and benevolence towards hindus will be ultimately subservient to the conversion imperative

1581692 kayamandi is dirty therere so many litters everyone who lives in it is responsible young or old we are members of one problem because we throw tins plastic bags glass and food waste on the street if we think our street is one large bin who are we rats living in a bin the municipality also needs to play a role such as hiring more people or providing more bins if we have these then kayamandi would be a much better place
1581693 is really a subliminal echo chamber of magical power to touch remote and forgotten chords
1581694 the announcement will be made without any fanfare later a public meeting will be held in hyderabad and tirupati after august 15 where the partys name agenda and programmes will be unveiled
1581695 wer sich nicht daran h lt wird in unserer mitgliederzeitschrift
1581696 ich kann nur sagen f r uns hat sich diese praxis sehr bew hrt und wenn andere dem folgen ist das sicher kein fehler
1581697 dar ber kann man reden nur sollen dann bitte die aufsichtsr te von der kapitalseite die gleichen ma st be an sich selbst anlegen
1581698 wir reden hier ber den konkreten fehler eines einzelnen wenn ein politiker einen fehler macht stellen wir ja auch nicht die demokratie infrage
1581699 die erste jahresh lfte war f r die prosiebensat 1 group nicht einfach der grund liegt auf der hand das deutsche werbezeiten vermarktungsmodell wurde von teilen des marktes nicht angenommen wir sind jedoch optimistisch mit dem im mai berarbeiteten modell im zweiten halbjahr 2008 marktanteile zur ckzugewinnen grunds tzlich sind wir seit der bernahme von sbs im vergangenen jahr strategisch auf dem richtigen weg wir investieren europaweit konsequent in unser kerngesch ft free tv und die entwicklung sowie den erwerb attraktiver inhalte unsere erl squellen konnten wir nicht nur geografisch diversifizieren sondern nutzen auch alle elektronischen verbreitungswege hier wird unser portfolio st ndig gr er auch der aufbau einer vollst ndig digitalen technologischen plattform ist ein wichtiger schritt um prosiebensat 1 zu europas f hrendem tv konzern zu machen
1581700 wir m ssen jedoch klar sagen dass dieses ergebnisziel mit unsicherheiten behaftet ist sie liegen einerseits in der geringen visibilit t im werbemarkt andererseits in der weiteren gesamtwirtschaftlichen entwicklung in unseren m rkten
1581701 wir haben entscheidende ma nahmen eingeleitet um unser portfolio zu straffen und unsere wettbewerbsf higkeit im deutschen markt zu verbessern mit gruppenweiten programmen zur effizienzsteigerung wollen wir im laufenden gesch ftsjahr kosten in h he von 70 mio euro im vergleich zum urspr nglich geplanten budget einsparen wir erwarten die hier gesteckten ziele in der zweiten jahresh lfte zu erreichen und signifikante einsparungen zu realisieren ohne unsere langfristigen wachstumsziele zu gef hrden
1581702 die bandbreite und qualit t der eingereichten bewerbungen erstaunen immer wieder
1581703 wir streben kurzfristig keine aufstockung an aber wir denken langfristig eher in dekaden als in jahren
1581704 in den n chsten f nf jahren zum f hrenden umweltdienstleister in deutschland
1581705 nach meiner einsch tzung sind deutsche sportler funktion re und politiker in peking sicher
1581706 in addition to the sale of retail stations in various countries omv had proposed a shared refinery cost center model to address the commission s principal concerns regarding the concentration of refining capacity across the region
1581707 omv proposed the creation of a refinery centre in which an independent third party could have held a capacity share with a share in corporate governance equal to omv
1581708 the eu has stated the need for a common european energy policy and to support a policy of creating stronger european energy companies to ensure the security of supply for the region fundamental objectives for our proposed combination with mol
1581709 we strongly believe in our original rationale for a strategic alliance with mol the combination of both companies would have significantly enhanced the security of energy supply throughout the region through both greater diversification of crude oil supply as well as the greater scale in upstream to generate additional growth of the combined resource base
1581710 omv has a core principle to only follow and implement value accretive deals we pursued our goal as long as there was a reasonable chance that such a transaction would meet our disciplined criteria for value generation given the indication from the european commission that it would not accept our remedy proposal omv s board has concluded that such a merger would not fulfil our standards
1581711 unser unternehmen hatte sich zum ziel gesetzt eine nahtlose strategie zur betrugserfassung einzurichten f r die keine komplizierte integration in backend anwendungen erforderlich war und genau das bietet uns diese l sung
1581712 die m glichkeit alle daten im hause zu behalten anstatt sie an einen anderen standort auszulagern war f r uns ein wichtiges argument diese initiative stellt eine perfekte erg nzung unseres engagements f r die online sicherheit unserer kunden dar
1581713 als eine der gr ssten gruppen von finanzunternehmen im nordischen raum ist dnb nor seinen kunden den aktion ren und dem markenimage gegen ber zu hohen sicherheitsstandards verpflichtet
1581714 das zero touch fraud detection programm hilft dem unternehmen nicht nur seine derzeitigen sicherheitsziele zu erreichen sondern erm glicht ihm auch die analyse wichtiger betrugsdaten um betr gerische angriffe in zukunft abzuwehren und sie vielleicht sogar zu bek mpfen bevor sie berhaupt auftreten das ist eine proaktive strategie f r ein finanzinstitut das bereits f r seine strengen und dabei unaufdringlichen sicherheitsl sungen und richtlinien bekannt ist
1581715 zus tzlich zu dem verkauf von tankstellen in verschiedenen l ndern hatte omv ein gemeinschaftsraffinerie cost center modell vorgeschlagen um die zentralen bedenken der kommission in bezug auf eine konzentration von raffineriekapazit ten in der region zu ber cksichtigen
1581716 omv hat einen raffinerieverbund vorgeschlagen in dem einem unabh ngigen dritten ein teil der kapazit t zur verf gung gestellt worden w re verbunden mit corporate governance rechten die denjenigen von omv gleichwertig gewesen w ren
1581717 die eu hat die notwendigkeit einer gemeinsamen europ ischen energiepolitik betont und ihre unterst tzung f r die schaffung st rkerer europ ischer energieunternehmen zum ausdruck gebracht um so die versorgungssicherheit in der region zu gew hrleisten wesentliche ziele die wir mit dem vorgeschlagenen zusammenschluss mit mol verfolgt haben
1581718 wir sind von der sinnhaftigkeit einer strategischen allianz mit mol berzeugt ein zusammenschluss der beiden unternehmen h tte die energieversorgungssicherheit in der gesamten region deutlich verbessert und zwar sowohl durch eine breitere diversifikation in der roh lbeschaffung als auch durch den gr eren umfang des upstream bereichs der ein zus tzliches wachstum der gemeinsamen ressourcenbasis mit sich gebracht h tte
1581719 es ist ein grundprinzip von omv nur wertsteigernde transaktionen zu verfolgen und zu verwirklichen solange vern nftigerweise eine aussicht darauf bestand dass die transaktion unseren strengen kriterien f r eine wertsteigerung gerecht wird haben wir unser ziel weiter verfolgt nachdem die europ ische kommission angedeutet hat die von uns vorgeschlagenen abhilfema nahmen nicht zu akzeptieren ist der vorstand von omv zu dem ergebnis gelangt dass ein zusammenschluss die von uns angelegten ma st be nicht erf llt
1581720 how the hell are ya its been a long time
1581721 we achieved highly encouraging second quarter organic sales growth despite a difficult economic environment still characterized by significantly increasing raw material costs and a weak us dollar
1581722 our organic growth was supported by all our business sectors the improvements were primarily from our growth regions while development in western europe was restrained we were able to further increase adjusted operating profit the integration of the national starch businesses which brought us a significant boost in sales and the implementation of our efficiency enhancement program aligned to achieving a sustainable improvement in our competitiveness continue on track with good progress being achieved despite the challenging environment we are confident regarding the development in the further course of the year

1581740 it is never too late to be what you might have been
1581741 the benefit of the doubt is to be given to the document itself and not arrogated by the critic to himself
1581742 one must listen to the claims of the document under analysis and not assume fraud or error unless the author disqualified himself by contradictions or known factual inaccuracies
1581743 any attempt to reject its basic historicity even in matters of detail must now appear absurd roman historians have long taken it for granted
1581744 it is interesting to observe that the lateness of the date proposed is often in proportion to the degree of a scholars skepticism as to their historical value the cynic might wonder which came first
1581745 i have been reading poems romances vision literature legends myths all my life i know what they are like i know that no one of them is like this these men ask me to believe that they can read between the lines of the old texts the evidence is their obvious inability to read in any sense worth discussing the lines themselves they claim to see fern see and cant see an elephant ten yards away in broad daylight
1581746 scores of archaeological findings have been made which confirm in clear outline or in exact detail historical statements in the bible
1581747 dette er ikke noe man gj r for bli popul r
1581748 often we allow ourselves to be upset by small things we should despise and forget we lose many irreplaceable hours brooding over grievances that in a years time will be forgotten by us and by everybody no let us devote our life to worthwhile actions and feelings to great thoughts real affections and enduring undertakings
1581749 no todos los que escuchan a los stones y bandas por el estilo son rolingas
1581750 i wouldnt miss the bonei olam event for anything in the world
1581751 this organization is there for the community and its my duty as a community member to be there for them especially when they come to deal
1581752 last year we stood here celebrating the births of 700 babies one year later we stand here and celebrate an additional 400 babies in one year how awesome a celebration is this and how awesome a responsibility is this for us to continue supporting bonei olam
1581753 we are going to protect our children and our streets
1581754 at 8 45 p m the streets of borough park are still well populated someone must have seen something we are urging witnesses to come forward with any information parents and teens must be more alert and vigilant to their surroundings until this attacker is caught
1581755 the perpetrator will be caught and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law
1581756 get clothes that fit it doesnt matter what it looks like
1581757 i always wanted to be a performer but at the time i decided to do drag i also wanted to be sort of a performer activist
1581758 i love to put a smile on peoples faces it is a joy to me to be able to get up on a stage and entertain while just being me and becoming something that no one could ever imagine i could do or be it is a way for me to meet people that are my age who share similar interests this gives me that opportunity to create that social life that i never felt i had when i was a young man drag has opened me up to be able to better handle occurrences in life and also how i react to them while some might say that i am hiding or pretending to be someone that i am not i can honestly say that this is not the case i have been living life in drag longer than i have been a boy
1581759 gay people often suffer discrimination and hostility from the straight world in addition they often have strained relationships with their families for these reasons the social support they receive from friends in the gay community can play a special role
1581760 over the years drag has helped me understand that if you dont love yourself no one is going to love you and you will not be able to love anybody else
1581761 websters dictionary does not list a word such as self worth so lets take it apart and understand each part self personal having its own identity personality worth deserving of value useful the definition i would give to self worth would be my valuable identity deserving all good things wegscheider cruse 1987 p 1
1581762 for me drag actually started on a dare about five years ago i did it and enjoyed it there was something about being on that stage in front of all the people that was just fun for me then i got involved with several charity organizations and found out that i could perform as a drag queen and help out the community at the same time my main purpose i perform now is for charity functions when there is a show and i dont feel like performing i think of all the people living with aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome that were presented with trip vouchers one year to go home to be with their families from an organization i help out called home for the holidays that memory gives me all the drive i need to be able to put on a face and hit that stage to raise money for charity
1581763 my motivation for performing is that i enjoy the creative aspect of it all i like creating a look that is all my own for the evening
1581764 my motivation to perform as either male or female i perform both is that it creates a different atmosphere for me at the bar or wherever the show is being held there is no stereotyping of a person for how they are dressed or who they want to be they are just free to be themselves in whatever way is most comfortable you can simply be there shake what your mother gave ya and enjoy yourself which should be every persons goal
1581765 activation or arousal theory attempts to correlate variations in level of psychological activity with changes in behavior it activation has been related to emotion and is important in understanding stress and stress related symptoms and disorders
1581766 individuals move from tolerating their homosexual self image to fully accepting it
1581767 contentment cheerfulness and self confidence need not be dependent upon externals at all if we are to be cause and not effect we have to take our stand in consciousness
1581768 currently the motivation comes from inside my heart more than ever before so many people in our community need assistance i believe that we all need to be entertained to have fun and raise money for charities but i also believe that without drag queens we wouldnt have the platforms to stand for what we believe in
1581769 when i initially started performing in drag it was a means for me to express myself without having to concern myself of the consequences of the real world ive always been a bit for the drama scene and the idea of creating a character and acting out a totally off the wall personality always seemed to be the best form of releasing ones inner pressures as time has passed it is now becoming more of a portal for me to reach a wider aspect of people it helps me to get my point across that many people would not typically listen to if i were merely standing on a soap box it allows me to be creative in the way i present the information i am trying to push out in the public hiv and aids awareness after finding out at an early age i was hiv it became very pressing that i help others like myself whom might be living destructive or harmful lifestyles and not only in the gay scene
1581770 individuals often become politically active in an attempt to change attitudes and laws that have a negative impact on gays and lesbians
1581771 dennis has been there too long hes forgotten why we sent him to congress in the first place
1581772 i just dont buy the argument from him that hes a fiscal conservative
1581773 the voters here know me they know what i stand for and what ive done
1581774 the vote demonstrates that our citizens understand that sales taxes are the fairest way to pay for critical public safety services we appreciate the public vote of confidence
1581775 why would you not want those outsiders to pay for the jail
1581776 the bottom line is that voters in johnson county have confidence in county government they knew that the expanded jail new juvenile services complex and expanded crime lab were needed
1581777 they saw through the noise and voted for a reasonable plan
1581778 boxed voters into an artificial crisis that says either you pass this particular sales tax proposal that lasts forever or your property taxes will be raised
1581779 with the exception of john toplikar our johnson county commissioners lied to us

1581790 we need muslim americans to get excited about the campaign and theres a lot to get excited about
1581791 i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
1581792 since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
1581793 we know this is an uphill battle and a long shot but i tell you what the kimberly mill is one of the best paper mills and has two of the biggest paper machines in the industry there is no reason this mill should be shut down
1581794 something is going on here that we dont understand we know this mill should run and we will do everything we can to keep it running and keep people working
1581795 theres a lot of politicians out there that have been trying to support the little guy so to speak and were looking for some help from the guys we put in office
1581796 this is really good this is the best cheesecake ive ever had
1581797 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1581798 i feel if hes a packer hes got to be the starter otherwise you trade him but who knows what they are going to do he wasnt at practice so maybe there is an indication that something is going on
1581799 i dont think were overly troubled they put us in that category i think we understand it but were making sure the maintenance is there to keep it in functional condition
1581800 many people think the hazard relates to the condition of the dam and that is not the case what it is is an estimation if the dam were to fail what could be affected by the failure

1581802 it threw up a lot of musical questions and some people thought this is going to be dreadful because were going to be lowering ourselves to sing rock music
1581803 but it was interesting because it was just as demanding
1581804 the competitions freed them as singers and its fed back into their classical stuff
1581805 you always hope for the best but you always think the other choirs sound so good
1581806 the others were a lot younger so you wonder if that could work against you
1581807 weve seen through this journey what it can do for individuals if we can get a tenth of that out to others in the community no matter what situation theyre in
1581808 i learned a lot i certainly didnt influence the outcome of that race

1581841 the curation course would not only focus on contemporary art but also stress on traditional art
1581842 globalization and information technology have made far off cultures accessible to people across the world this course would provide students with the tools to look at these cultures through an aesthetics perspective
1581843 m a and m phil students have already started working on an exhibition on the contemporary indian art the exhibition will be held by the end of november at an art gallery in gurgaon
1581844 as far as medical literature goes we have not witnessed such a case at least in asia this was a very difficult and tricky surgery to replace two discs each at the neck and lower back at one sitting is unique
1581845 two level disc replacement surgery is a rarely conducted procedure in india due to the complications involved as it is requires a lot of precision
1581846 in two level replacing two discs cervical disc replacement you not only have to open the vertebral column but also have to protect the food pipe during surgery hence one has to be very careful
1581847 disc number 5 6 and 6 7 were replaced with metals discs in the neck similarly metal discs replaced the l4 l5 and l5 sacrum bone discs in the lower back
1581848 the patient has started moving around and will be fit to resume his normal life in six weeks time
1581849 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1581850 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1581851 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1581852 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy
1581853 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1581854 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1581855 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1581856 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1581857 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1581858 i was able to put my pads on get some reps hit the bag and explode off coming out of my steps it felt good i had a couple of passes where i really wanted to see where i was at as far as taking a flat route to my left and turning up on my left i stuck my foot in the ground pretty hard a couple times and i didnt feel anything different so that was a relief
1581859 hes making progress the way we do it instead of just throwing a guy back in well add to it when hes ready if hes comfortable tomorrow with the individual stuff than maybe we can get him a little bit of limited team work
1581860 its a different animal but if you dedicate yourself to what you want to accomplish and treat yourself right i dont think its a problem
1581861 athletes are stubborn we want to get going with this surgery you have to be really careful about when you get back out there you feel okay but you really have to give that cartilage time to heal
1581862 i think it will respond well because ive been really pushing myself as far as my conditioning i dont feel that im that far off if im off at all i was able to recover between reps today its killed me not being out there but i have to be smart and do this right
1581863 i think hes feeling the best hes felt the last few days and he has really come on
1581864 i bet dallas is looking at the same thing with wade phillips there they run a defense very similar to ours were both very similar on offense we both run the ball and are big in play action pass weve been practicing against a lot of the things well see by going against ourselves well just use thursday do minimal preparation and go play
1581865 i would rather have him miss extra days here than have a nagging injury that carried him through six or eight weeks like a hamstring can hes making progress he was going real good when he was practicing i feel good about it
1581866 did you hight light your hair did you perm it did you cut it how much did you spend if you think youre making too much money pay for the bills for me dont wasted you money
1581867 i thought you lost some weight when i saw another picture but after i see this one i know that must be just a wrong impression

1581869 the belief that the world can drastically cut global carbon dioxide emissions at a time when about half of the people on the planet are still living in relative energy poverty borders on fantasy moreover the industrialized countries in general and the u s in particular have no moral standing from which to tell the developing countries that they should slow the growth of their energy consumption
1581870 the developed countries of the world can talk forever about the virtues of solar panels and windmills but what the energy poor need most are common fuels like kerosene propane and gasoline and just like us they want reliable electricity the people in the industrialized countries have a moral obligation to help the energy poor get cheap reliable energy and it is undeniable that the cheapest and most reliable forms of energy for now are fossil fuels bringing hundreds of millions of people out of energy poverty and thus into higher standards of living means providing them with access to cheap plentiful energy like it or not that largely means fossil fuels and increased use of fossil fuels will mean further increases in carbon dioxide emissions the hard truth is that the people of the world are going to have to adapt to a warmer planet regardless of the cause of that warming

1581894 jeg er enig i at der er problemer med l reruddannelsen mit nske har v ret at de studerende skulle mere i praktik end de er i den nuv rende uddannelse
1581895 jeg ser gerne at der er v sentlig mere praktik s de unge l rere der bliver uddannet kan f le sig mere sikre p opgaven med at v re sammen med b rnene for det er sv rt at l re p et seminarium p samme m de er det sv rt at l re for ldresamarbejde som mange nye l rere har meget sv rt ved p et seminarium

1581897 det er ikke klogt med st rre ndringer af l reruddannelsen allerede nu for den skal have ro til at virke inden vi kan bed mme resultaterne men praktikken kan sagtens forbedres inden for de nuv rende rammer med bedre samarbejde mellem skoler kommuner og uddannelsessteder

1581908 the elves represent as it were the artistic aesthetic and purely scientific aspects of human nature raised to a higher level than is actually seen in men that is they have a devoted love of the physical world and a desire to observe and understand it for its own sake and as other sc as a reality derived from god in the same degree as themselves not as a material for use or as a power platform they also possess a subcreational or artistic faculty of great excellence
1581909 undoubtedly tolkien was similarly concerned about the possibilities of technology as a tool and craft not as a luddite but with the realization that such rapid transformation seductive immediacy and potentially unlimited power requires great wisdom and temperance to wield in the age of the machine the wraithing process of transforming sub creators into shadow is obfuscated by the seduction of ease immediacy and speed a technological age only compounds our abnegation of light for shadow the seduction to abandon elvish craft for the immediacy of saurons magic not only affects the world around us but transforms us into wraiths and orcs horror and evil in the 20th century have taught us that horrendous evil is carried out with the most banal ease tolkiens response is simple courage that comes not from a code or an aesthetic principle but from an embracing of the ontological reality of who we are as human beings
1581910 imagine a world in which all the things we make use and consume provide nutrition for nature and industry a world in which growth is good and human activity generates a delightful restorative ecological footprint indeed good design principled design based on the laws of nature can transform the making and consumption of things into a regenerative force this new conception of design known as cradle to cradle design goes beyond retrofitting industrial systems to reduce their harm cradle to cradle design on the other hand offers a framework in which the effective regenerative cycles of nature provide models for wholly positive human designs within this framework we can create economies that purify air land and water that rely on current solar income and generate no toxic waste that use safe healthful materials that replenish the earth or can be perpetually recycled and that yield benefits that enhance all life

1582006 i am the door anyone who enters in through me will be saved will live
1582007 therefore then since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses who have borne testimony to the truth let us strip off and throw aside every encumbrance unnecessary weight and that sin which so readily deftly and cleverly clings to and entangles us and let us run with patient endurance and steady and active persistence the appointed course of the race that is set before us looking away from all that will distract to jesus who is the leader and the source of our faith giving the first incentive for our belief and is also its finisher bringing it to maturity and perfection he for the joy of obtaining the prize that was set before him endured the cross despising and ignoring the shame and is now seated at the right hand of the throne of god

1582036 the hero or the goat why men die to the thing that really struck me about your piece is the paragraph in which you write the saddest part of it all is how senseless these 11 deaths are the marines rushing into urban conflict in anbar province i can wholeheartedly admire the firemen who ran into the burning towers of 9 11 and lost their lives i remember in my prayers with gratitude and admiration i completely disagree with this sentiment these 11 people died doing something they loved moreover the fact that they were able to successfully climb if people talked about mountain climbing the same way they talk about cycling or track and field these 11 people would be heralded as among the top athletes in their sport if a male cyclist had succumbed to a heart attack while competing in the tour de france i doubt youd attribute his death to macho stupidity by the way if youd like to learn anything about climbing large mountains and the fatalities that sometimes occur on them you might want to read mount everest in 1996 in which many people died i believe several women lost their lives in that assent i know that no children are going to lose their mother up there on the mountain this time

1582251 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons

1582290 it also reminds them that if they get sprayed theyre going to still have to help their buddies get the situation under control even though theyre going to be in pain
1582291 its such rotten nasty stuff they help each other get through it

1582293 and to make sure the only way theyre going to make the news there is by doing something good
1582294 if we mess it up nothing else we do really matters

1582307 it appears that our anti spam filters caused some blogger accounts to be blocked from creating new posts
1582308 while we are still investigating we believe this may have been caused by mass spam e mails mentioning the just say no deal network of blogs which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e mails as spam we have restored posting rights to the affected blogs and it is very important to us that blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression

1582344 the ultimate goal is to equip those who attend to maintain and improve their fitness level people get more motivated when they go to the personal trainer but when they leave the ultimate goal of the trainer like the goal of the church is for the person to live outside what theyve learned inside the gym
1582345 the church and the parent should work hand in hand the pastor provides a level of instruction that the parent probably cant fully provide his goal is to equip the parent with an appropriate level of instruction the parent is not only to be an instructor but a model
1582346 even the redeemed heart has an inclination toward sin our hearts need to be strengthened by grace
1582347 people in the gym who are looking in the mirror all the time
1582348 christ cant flow through you into the world if your heart is clogged with spiritual plaque
1582349 it requires that we know the heart of god but also that we acknowledge that our own hearts are unfit
1582350 to get at the core of it is to understand who god is and to understand the depths of our own need

1582364 owns any property located within sight or sound of the subject property is aggrieved
1582365 he presented no evidence that the pharmacy and its parking lot would cause his property to devaluate
1582366 and which is more important none of the appellants were able to show that the value of their respective property would be adversely affected
1582367 there was no specific testimony as to any adverse effect upon the value of the siegelhome
1582368 that the value of their residential properties would be depreciated by the proposed reclassification
1582369 block his view and sunlight increase noise increase traffic reduce parking and reduce the value of his residence
1582370 would it be common sense to go to a formal hearing without any prepared evidence or testimony to support your case
1582371 the facts necessary to satisfy the aggrieved requirement when the petitioner is a governmental entity appear to be that it have an interest in interpreting administering and enforcing the laws in question in a given case

1582385 hey i heard jesus turned water into wine i wonder if he is going to tell us we need to drink wine what we can do is get wasted i mean its five oclock somewhere what we will do is drink all our problems away
1582386 jesus went to the wilderness to pray he is going to tell us to take a vacation
1582387 listen if you are overwhelmed because you are working too hard and your schedule is too busy then ive got more work for you to do
1582388 for this reason i labor and i strive according to his power working in me
1582389 i want you to do my work in my ministry with my power for my glory
1582390 i have heard you talking about going on the mission trip to mexico i cant do that right now because of my schedule i have too much to do
1582391 take my yoke i know where there is laughter i know where there is joy i know where there is living water for your soul but you must take my yoke
1582392 god here is my schedule you see how busy i am so if you are going to bless me then please do it at 2pm on tuesday

1582397 there is a person without a companion without even a son or brother and though there is no end to all his struggles his eyes are still not content with riches so who am i struggling for he asks and depriving myself from good this too is futile and a miserable task two are better than one because they have a good reward for their efforts for if either falls his companion can lift him up but pity the one who falls without another to lift him up also if two lie down together they can keep warm but how can one person alone keep warm and if somebody overpowers one person two can resist him a cord of three strands is not easily broken
1582398 god build warmth and intimacy into my life show me where and how to whole heartedly give myself to others for your purposes
1582399 the plans of the diligent certainly lead to profit but anyone who is reckless only becomes poor
1582400 you will find there is money being spent that you dont know is being spent
1582401 statistics tell us that people will spend 33 percent more by using a credit card or debit card over cash
1582402 there is less of a connection when you swipe a credit card than when you pull cash from your wallet
1582403 if you are not currently paying cash for your cars consider making car payments to yourself now so that when the time comes for the next vehicle purchase you can write a check
1582404 you want to be the banker instead of letting mastercard or visa be your banker
1582405 i just kept renewing my policy because i had it automatically coming out of my checking account
1582406 i hate to get on the phone with an agent it takes more time because you have to drag out your policy and go over it but i was shocked at how much i ended up saving for the exact same coverage
1582407 you have to do two things look at past history and trust god
1582408 we can no longer afford to be passive about identity theft
1582409 if you really want to be vigilant and reduce your risk then sign up to receive all of your bank financial and credit card statements electronically
1582410 who are you to call me a sinner dont throw stones at me unless you are without sin
1582411 my sin is my personal business and does not hurt anybody else
1582412 if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and this we know the blood of jesus cleanses us from all our sin
1582413 if you will confess your sins the lord jesus is faithful and righteous to forgive us and to cleanse us for all unrighteousness
1582414 the next election in western australia is all going to be about providing good government for the people of this state
1582415 at the last election the liberal party came within 1000 votes in a handful of seats of winning government this time theres some unfinished business
1582416 in the last four years five labor ministers have either been sacked or stood down from cabinet that is an appalling record
1582417 at the time of the last election i made a mistake in the way that was handled
1582418 its time in western australia for some big thinking some forward thinking
1582419 i spoke to ms willmott this morning i hope that the matter can be resolved some options have been put to diedre shell have to consider those

1582421 i would hope that liz might be persuaded to play a role in working with the liberal party to remove this government
1582422 what i would find more morally dubious is my insisting to another that his or her reading or presuppositions because they are not pluralistic are somehow wrong the evangelical christian should be free to try to seek to convert me to christianity such an attempt is biblically warranted and consistent with evangelical exclusivist theology i remain free to say thank you but no thanks i would not want someone telling me that my cherished confessional traditions have only limited value i would not presume to do the same to another

1582444 real ale is a natural living product so there is a much greater intensity of flavours
1582445 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1582446 pasteurising and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavours
1582447 a processed keg beer is completely inert a dead flat liquid drawn up to bar with carbon dioxide to put some life in it thats why theyre so fizzy compared to a real ale
1582448 golden brown session beer full bodied with an aroma of floral hops initial malty flavour fades as citrus and hops take over leading to a hoppy bitter finish
1582449 its one of the hardest beers to brew because there are fewer ingredients in it and weve managed to put a lot of flavour into a low alcohol beer and keep it consistent

1582555 oh you mean that greek god whose chest is as broad as bode is tall
1582556 we scratched and we clawed and we pulled some runs together ive been talking about that all year long the will to fight
1582557 it feels like youre hitting on sound at that point in time
1582558 hes one of those guys that obviously throws a very plus plus fastball in that situation all i was really trying to do was put the barrel on the ball hes generating so much power with his fastball if you hit it solidly which is rare its going to go a long way
1582559 i can count probably four other times that its been like this

1582569 it seems that the market is losing interest in geopolitical and weather induced prop and instead is becoming more aware of growing supply demand imbalances

1582574 they are treated as a commodity and pay their way into the country as documented workers and then abandoned to fend for themselves
1582575 at every turn people in the establishment either enforcement personnel government officials politicians or businessmen are making money out of the migrant worker

1582582 current policies are reactive ad hoc wholly contradictory and driven by political consideration
1582583 rampant corruption is a key reason why migrant workers end up being treated as a commodity
1582584 the solution is to hand over the migrant worker sector to the human resources ministry to deal with it as a human resource issue
1582585 currently the home ministry handles it because it is seen as a security issue
1582586 imagine the sums involved if you make rm 5 000 1 525 dollars per worker and you have a recruit quota of 10 000 workers said fernandez
1582587 outsourcing companies presently get their licenses from the immigration department to recruit workers
1582588 this is unsatisfactory because it is subject to and a major source of abuse and corruption
1582589 we also want a reasonable wage scheme for workers low income workers are currently subject to exploitation due to the poor employment conditions they undergo and are unable to afford decent living especially with rising rates of inflation and an overall increase in the costs of living

1582598 lately when i retired to my home determined so far as possible to bother about nothing except spending the little life i have left in rest and seclusion it seemed to me i could do my mind no greater favor than to let it entertain itself in full idleness and stay and settle in itself which i hoped it might do more easily now having become weightier and riper with time
1582599 that on the contrary like a runaway horse it gives itself a hundred times more trouble than it took for others and gives birth to so many chimeras and fantastic monsters one after another without order or purpose that in order to contemplate their ineptitude and strangeness at my pleasure i have begun to put them in writing hoping in time to make my mind ashamed of itself

1582666 im not going to get into the specific issues because it involves personnel issues but discipline was addressed promptly in both cases
1582667 my concern is this has been going on more than this year
1582668 from listening to other parents i understand this has happened before and nothing constructive has happened before
1582669 it is unfortunate weve had some regrettable instances occur at this point were working as hard as we can to make sure that they do not happen again
1582670 people who live on streets like this now get discouraged

1582674 from our perspective we want to hold them accountable but we also want to work with them to help them be accountable
1582675 if you look through the audit and read specifically all of the items in there youll see a lot of these things speak to former processes and speak to former employees that are no longer with us
1582676 they havent been with us for over a year so again before this audits seen the light of day internally we did some things to clean the ship up
1582677 the deck is the primary issue right now because its kind of the headline when if you read the audit it was permission granted behind that from an employee thats no longer here
1582678 everything was done above board i dont know i really dont know what the issue is at this point
1582679 theres really a critical time that you want to get there before the phenomenon of flashover occurs and when that occurs in a house the chances of survival go down drastically for anybody thats in that house

1582684 ive had pretty much a ltitle bit of everything in the first four games
1582685 but im glad im here and want to see more of it
1582686 we showed some power we were a little bit down but we gave the team a chance to come back the way we did
1582687 thornton didnt even let us ask him if he was all right to pitch that last inning knowing we had only one more guy rookie adam russell
1582688 the bullpen has been getting hammered lately by the media and fans but they stepped up big time
1582689 he throws a very plus plus fastball hes generating so much power with his fastball if you can hit it solidly which is rare its going to go a long way
1582690 but it donest matter were in first place and i could really care less about numbers

1582700 theres no question about it wall street got drunk thats one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover
1582701 the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
1582702 and then we got a housing issue not in houston and evidently not in dallas because laura was over there trying to buy a house today
1582703 unfortunately after eight years of asking her to sacrifice im now no longer the decision maker

1582751 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1582752 broader action beyond retailers alone is required to protect consumer data banks and the us payment card industry must join retailers and work together
1582753 there are thousands of conduits to customer data security isnt working and tjx is the poster child of a big data breach

1582755 we instituted significant system upgrades and we are continuously employing measures to help protect data against the ever increasing sophistication of thieves

1582778 i would hope that no one would be foreclosed upon between now and october 1st who would have qualified for this program had the effective date been immediate and that is within your power to do you can show some forbearance october 1st is coming begin the planning begin the talking with people but i think it would be a shame an embarrassment to all of us if people were to lose their homes and the neighborhood deterioration were to be advanced and the economy would suffer because to satisfy cbo and other rules we delayed this a couple of months i earnestly hope that we can have that kind of cooperation
1582779 as one who has focused on mortgage servicing from the outset of this crisis i strongly support the chairmans call for forbearance until october 1st it would be shameful for a single homeowner in california or anywhere else hit hard by the foreclosure crisis to lose their home if they could have been helped by this program but for this deadline
1582780 one of the things we have been told is look there is this problem because the people who service the loans are not the people who own the loans and there is this split between the people who have we are told the authority to make the decision to reduce and the beneficial owners on whose behalf they are acting well you cant expect the beneficial owners to do this people who own pieces of pools

1582785 or rather with everything but in a condition of complete unconsciousness and toxic stagnation western intellectuals are all sitting addicts thats why most of you are so repulsively unwholesome in the past even a duke had to do a lot of walking even a moneylender even a metaphysician and when they werent using their legs they were jogging about on horses whereas now from the tycoon to the typist from the logical positivist to the positive thinker you spend nine tenths of your time on foam rubber spongy seats for spongy bottoms at home in the office in cars and bars in planes and trains and buses no moving of legs no struggles with distance and gravity just lifts and planes and cars just foam rubber and an eternity of sitting the life force that used to find an outlet through striped muscle gets turned back on the viscera and the nervous system and slowly destroys them

1582832 the good news is that ive retained the citrus beat primarily due to the fact nobody else wanted it so i will continue reporting on the ups and downs of citrus growers processors and packers
1582833 the bad news is that given the realities of being asked to do more with less as bob crawford was fond of saying not referring to his travel arrangements the amount of time and energy available to citrus will diminish you may have already noticed i havent posted a blog entry in three weeks as the effort of wrapping things up in business and getting established in four communities haines city polk city lake hamilton and lake alfred has occupied my work weeks recently
1582834 its about how all of us in business journalism are being sandbagged by those awful people running exxon mobil and the other major oil companies who are busy gouging us while tossing the press their malarkey about supply and demand being behind the rise in oil prices
1582835 well yes malarkey is the right word but its a word that more appropriately describes rainess column he seems to believe that the big problem in the united states is that the oil companies are not exploring enough on the vast unused acreage in existing oil leases apparently he hasnt been to fort worth recently where companies are drilling for natural gas in peoples backyards literally he sloughs off the tens of billions big oil spends each year exploring for oil and doesnt even seem to realize that the 25 billion exxon mobil paid last year to foreign governments is money that makes such exploration possible he flicks aside the notion that the oil companies want to build more refineries ignoring the fact that the lack of new refinery capacity is a huge bottleneck that helps push up prices he mocks network tv anchors and correspondents for portraying big oil companies as powerless victims to supply and demand never mind that exxon mobil for instance controls less than 2 percent of the worlds oil supply most of the worlds oil is controlled by countries not companies and they tend to be pretty unabashed about wanting higher prices

1582899 he was a poet a genius and an egotist the sort of person i have always got on with and we became very good friends sex was one way of relating with serge probably his favorite way with a woman but we had a philosophical affinity a serious platonic friendship based on surrealism poetry and oscar wilde serge was very interested in the spiritual content he knew all about rastafarianism he knew about everything

1582905 i didnt freak out i just stayed calm and waited for the right wave and it paid off in the end
1582906 its just an amazing feeling im so stoked right now
1582907 i finished second last year it was definitely my goal to take it out this year to do it is amazing
1582908 the standard is so high and with all the international crew it makes it such a good event
1582909 it took a while to get going this morning but am still happy with how i surfed
1582910 im really happy with the boards ive got at the moment and feel really confident after a good result in my last few competitions
1582911 being able to compare my surfing against all the other international guys is really important for all the australian surfers myself included
1582912 it definitely raises the bar and makes you want to surf better
1582913 its the pinnacle of the junior competitions around the world which is why so many international guys come over
1582914 ive been building up for this event all year so i want to take the title
1582915 the waves here suit my surfing and i feel pretty confident in these conditions
1582916 ive never got past the quarter final stages at the rusty gromfest so im looking to better my results of previous years

1582921 i dropped my job i dropped all my dreams i dropped the chance to get a girlfriend
1582922 i dropped everything but the promotion of the olympic spirit with only one thought i cannot have other thoughts i must keep one thought in mind or i cannot reach my goal
1582923 as a common chinese citizen i want to transmit this feeling of joy and to tell friends from all over the world what the olympic spirit is
1582924 i want to train and test myself through hardship and diligence and also to challenge myself i think this is the olympic spirit
1582925 of course the police have a duty to protect themselves and the community from violent situations but arming more officers with dangerous weapons without the rigorous training and necessary safeguards could well be a recipe for disaster

1582936 the americans have produced material which they say they have had no chance to give though they gave it to the acc and they gave it to the primates all the time different things are being presented to different groups and so not everyone is in the loop
1582937 the assumption is that polity is made by bishops some of us live in churches that believe in synodical government we can influence but not control
1582938 when people stood up and said well my brother americans i disagree fundamentally and theologically with you but i will not leave the anglican communion that for me kept up the spirit of indaba
1582939 in indaba we do not write each other off we say i may disagree with you but lets keep on defining what our position is and through that we will finally come to an agreement
1582940 my sense is that even if we are not articulating it as such even if sometimes we are clumsy at that the fact that we have stayed right through and engaged one another is a positive thing
1582941 well be looking for the lambeth conference to work out these proposals in more detail we need to have the windsor continuation group give a bit of a steer so they can show the way the communion should be moving
1582942 my sense is it would bring people together face to face to talk about these things
1582943 learning from pile foundation design for new kitakyushu airport bridge
1582944 no one in his or her right frame of mind would have said these things given this the best option would be for the teacher to be assigned to a desk job and not be allowed to be near youngsters anymore
1582945 the allegations were serious as no one was allowed to insult others especially in a school environment
1582946 she also said that she did not expect things to become so serious and has agreed to be transferred to another school
1582947 she must make a public apology as she insulted all indians and be transferred to a desk job and not allowed to teach anymore

1582950 our focus is to play basketball thats what were there for thats what we do best were not politicians or government officials
1582951 at the end of the day you are talking about human rights
1582952 we want to keep basketball and politics separate we are focused on getting a gold medal and not focused on politics
1582953 that situation will be taken care of and whatever happens happens

1582983 one doesnt have to follow too much to look good there are a few simple tricks which if one keeps in mind there is no limit to how well presented you can look irrespective of the size of your clothes the best bet would be to layer their clothes with fabrics that fall softly or with semi lined jackets which are without shoulder pads these can be combined with a line bottoms and printed tops as they would hide the parts that you want to hide one could also have a fusion of indo western garments you could team churidars or slim fit pants with long tops preferably knee length distract is the key word here you want to take the other persons attention away from such areas this can be done by accentuating the other more flattering parts for example for women with large arms they should shift the focus by wearing wide necklines and drop shoulders for women with heavy waistlines an empire cut would be apt as it brings the focus higher towards the bust line straight fits also work for this figure type to not include prints in a womans wardrobe is truly unfair a figure size should not handicap ones wardrobe that much fine prints are very workable preferably in neutral or dark tones fine net all over or fine scattered motifs work best these should be used in slimmer areas to use the distract rule mentioned earlier with dark tones like burgundy wine chocolate navy or the regular but favorite black princess cuts as they cut the figure but shoulder princess for women with heavier upper bodies armhole for heavier hips and waists the a line silhouette and bias works well for formal bottoms fabrics should be lightweight and soft fall with not too much body or too tight the basic sheath also works for some larger figures
1582984 bras for plus size women should primarily provide comfort and maximum support bras with two to three section cups are ideal as they provide shape and additional support to heavy bosom full cover silhouettes also provide full support and better coverage avoid padded bras cotton fabric cups in the bra are advisable as they naturally wick moisture away non stretch cups provide added lift and support strap bras with padded cushion shoulder guards provides additional comfort and prevents the straps from cutting into skin and thereby relieves pressure and pain on the shoulder or neck it helps distribute the weight of the breast evenly and increase comfort flexible wire free frame lifts and give fit and firm support under wires also give good support but may dig in or cause pressure areas to develop minimizer bras could also be looked into as they help to reduce the bust line and offers sleek fit wide bottom band bras also is a good option without rolling or riding up
1582985 but on my way into manchester driving like a werewolf it never occurred to me that i was not quite as sane as id always thought i was there is something seriously bent when you think on it in the notion that a man with good sense would race out of his peaceful mountain home in colorado and fly off in a frenzy like some kind of electrified turkey buzzard to spend three of four days being carried around the foulest sections of new england like a piece of meat to watch another man who says he wants to be president embarrassing a lot of people by making them shake his hand outside factory gates at sunrise
1582986 tentu pak gubernur dan wagub wajib mengembalikan uang itu sesuai saran bpk dalam laporan hasil pemeriksaan lhp apbd ntb tahun 2007
1582987 sebetulnya sekitar tahun 95 an sudah ada suplemen serat buat anak di indonesia yaitu dalam bentuk ekstrak sayur dan buah tapi karena krismon produk tersebut menghilang dari pasaran mungkin karena barang impor harganya mahal
1582988 kalau digabung malah bertolak belakang karena sayur berfungsi untuk membangun sel sel tubuh atau membangun perkembangan dan pertumbuhan sedangkan buah berfungsi untuk membersihkan sisa sisa metabolisme
1582989 pagi hari tubuh bersifat basa hingga lebih bagus diberikan suplemen serat buah yang bersifat asam namun sore atau setelah siang kondisi tubuh sudah bersifat asam maka harus mengkonsumsi sayur yang sifatnya basa dengan demikian reaksi kimianya jadi netral
1582990 ini berkaitan dengan pertumbuhan dan perkembangan tubuh bukankah membangun sel sel tubuh lebih bagus di waktu malam sebab dengan tidur dan beristirahat metabolisme pun berjalan lebih optimal
1582991 bila di musim hujan dan teman teman si anak banyak yang batuk pilek hingga si anak perlu daya tahan tubuh yang bagus maka dosisnya boleh 2 dalam sekali makan untuk masing masing suplemen tersebut tapi kalau sehari hari tak ada apa apa maka sehari sekali juga cukup
1582992 cuma dianjurkan minum obatnya diberi selang waktu minimal 3 4 jam
1582993 biasanya untuk anak kecil itu kan makannya sore nah setelah makan boleh diberikan suplemennya sedangkan obat dokternya diminum sebelum si anak tidur
1582994 enggak apa apa juga kok karena fungsi tiap sayur berbeda beda paling dalam makanan anak hanya ada dua tiga macam sayur atau bahkan cuma semacam sementara dalam suplemen serat sayur jenis sayurnya bisa sampai 21 macam lo
1582995 biasanya anak yang sering batuk pilek dan demam kita anjurkan minum suplemen yang buah
1582996 jadi buah atau sayur alami ini diekstrak pada suhu dingin sampai menjadi bubuk lalu dimasukkan ke kapsul tentunya dengan proses dan cara canggih yang dilakukan di amerika dan bahan bahannya pun diambil dari perkebunan khusus yang tak ada pestisida dan segala macamnya bahkan produk suplemen serat sayur dan buah untuk anak juga sudah diakui oleh fda di sana artinya ini sesuai dengan kebutuhan serat per hari yang proporsional dalam tubuh dan dilengkapi dengan vitamin mineral dan unsur unsur phytonutrient dari buah dan sayur
1582997 bukankah kapsul bisa dibuka dan diambil isinya pemberiannya bisa dicampur madu sirup atau air gula bahkan dicampur dengan susu pun boleh tapi untuk yang sayur sebaiknya tak dicampur karena bau sayurnya hingga nanti malah anak tak suka dengan susunya
1582998 jadi kekurangan atau kebanyakan serat akibatnya bisa sama anak susah bab
1582999 jadi kalau anak kebanyakan makan serat akan membentuk banyak gas anak bisa kembung dan rasanya jadi tak enak
1583000 mungkin saja kandungan zat gizinya tetap sama itu pun kalau betul betul dibuat dari ekstrak zat itu sendiri misal jus buah atau sayur bukan yang buatan pabrik dari buah sayur ataupun yang dibuat secara reaksi kimia atau sintetis
1583001 wortel harus dikunyah anak bisa merasakan dengan menggigitnya dan ada rasa wortelnya sedangkan suplemen tak bisa menyamainya jadi dalam hal yang nonnutrisi seperti rasa serta aroma tekstur dan konsistensi tetap tak bisa disamai
1583002 ah well indonesians may not have the first amendment but i uphold it in my heart
1583003 that he was from fort bragg and thats where she was going
1583004 while it is common here to find some penguins both dead and alive swept by strong ocean currents from the strait of magellan there has been more this year than any time in recent history
1583005 niteroi the biggest zoo already has received about 100 penguins for treatment this year
1583006 aside from the oil in the campos basin the pollution is lowering the animals immunity leaving them vulnerable to funguses and bacteria that attack their lungs
1583007 i dont think the levels of pollution are high enough to affect the birds so quickly i think instead were seeing more young and sick penguins because of global warming which affects ocean currents and creates more cyclones making the seas rougher
1583008 we are working back from a population of patients who got sick in a single geographic area that ate in a single place
1583009 we asked where peppers linked to that cluster came from
1583010 this is far too long for an outbreak to spread unresolved and it is unacceptable for public health farmers and the food produce industry
1583011 when a witness attempted to take a picture of the doll head
1583012 one of the officers immediately took it down stuffed the baby head in the trunk of the car and walked away laughing
1583013 i would describe our relations as good in harlem and quite frankly throughout the city
1583014 we are always going to have some pockets of tension because of what we do because of the enforcement aspects of the work that the police department does
1583015 its sending a message to anyone else who is thinking of doing that that its not worth it this is what you are going to face
1583016 wow it seems like theres a lot of crime on this corner
1583017 i dont understand why the officers used such brute force to arrest him
1583018 they were all just around him and he was on the ground and not moving
1583019 began struggling with officers as they attempted to handcuff him officers immediately realized that david woodman was not breathing and they began to give cpr and summoned ems to that location
1583020 we are left to surmise that something occurred while he was in police custody that stopped is heart
1583021 it appears from the evidence we have reviewed thus far that officers did not use excessive force no pepper spray or batons were used in this incident
1583022 based upon what we know thus far we do not believe that any excessive force was used and we do believe officers responded reasonably
1583023 but nothing those officers did that night caused his death
1583024 at amp t knows wi fi is hot and free wi fi even hotter which is why we are proud to offer iphone customers free access to the nations largest wi fi hotspot network with more than 17 000 hotspots

1583026 we know how important wi fi is and we intend to make it available to as many people as we can but nothing can be announced today
1583027 whoa there is way too much going on in this cup

1583038 what a mockery that after five years detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1583039 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
1583040 when the truth comes out people will see she did nothing wrong
1583041 we demand that aafias trial should not take place in guantanamo bay we demand that aafias relatives be allowed immediate access to her
1583042 solzhenitsyn was one of the most important people in the history of russia he wrote exactly what he thought and needed to be remembered
1583043 its a shame that not all young people understand how important he is the young people of russia today understand less and less
1583044 the young know he wrote important books about the camps and that he received the nobel prize but thats all we really know hes more important for the older generations
1583045 but recently in politics for russia its not clear what he has done
1583046 he became one of the main battering rams in destroying both the state and nation
1583047 that is why he is being applauded so rapturously by both russian president medvedev and u s president bush
1583048 she has a right to not talk to us about it but certainly as the mother i would hope she would be willing to give us whatever information she had to help us find her child
1583049 as we continue to investigate this we find more inconsistencies in the mothers story
1583050 you left your 2 year old child with a person who does not exist at an apartment you cannot identify
1583051 you lied to your parents about your child whereabouts you cared so little about your child
1583052 we dont know where she is our concern is for the child and to locate her
1583053 i have never visited yasukuni on august 15 and i will maintain that stance
1583054 not something i do as a person holding a public position
1583055 the court has opined that the medical expert body which was directed to submit a report has submitted that the child will not be a permanent disabled as contemplated
1583056 tomorrows meeting i think should literally be an effective meeting i think it should also be decisive
1583057 i have also said that we should impeach the dictator who twice violated the constitution and committed high treason
1583058 if there is no progress then we will have to take some decision
1583059 politics both domestic and international along with the macroeconomic scenario are now going to shape the future direction of the market
1583060 what is web 2 0 i ended up passing up the class if it wasnt for you and your site i may never have come into contact with that information what a great thing
1583061 a new experimental website that puts information online in a way that encourages authorial attribution unlike articles for the popular online encyclopedia wikipedia which anyone is free to revise knol articles will have individual authors whose pictures and credentials will be prominently displayed alongside their work

1583064 do not speak of your happiness to one less fortunate than yourself
1583065 i think the sunday suns campaign is great and i am giving it my full support
1583066 anyone can turn a glass into a dangerous weapon and the consequences can be devastating
1583067 i myself have nearly been on the receiving end of a glassing
1583068 fortunately i wasnt hurt but it is frightening being in such a situation
1583069 i dont mind drinking out of a polycarbonate glass on a night out if it makes for a safer place its just as enjoyable and best of all you dont get cut feet on the dance floor
1583070 we decided to go polycarbonate after we saw the sunday suns campaign
1583071 we started stocking the polycarbonate glasses in june and it has made a hell of a difference
1583072 the place looks tidier and you cannot tell the difference between the glasses
1583073 they are a little lighter to carry and they keep the beer cool
1583074 staff are much happier as there is no broken glass to clear up and customers like it too
1583075 we would not go back to glass now i think polycarbonate is the way forward and we would recommend it to other bars
1583076 oooh look whos sitting next to each other ziggys pulled again
1583077 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1583078 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china
1583079 my main objective in my discussions on religious freedom is to remind this new generation of leadership that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1583080 this is surprising since an earlier thermal and evolved gas analyzer measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1583081 while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1583082 we are going to make sure that zuma becomes president of this country no matter what no zuma no country
1583083 there is no other army in the world that would take such a humanitarian approach to help palestinians some armed being chased and fired at by hamas
1583084 israel has not received any praises for its actions yet this is the kind of army we have
1583085 in the last three or four years there are at least 10 15 countries where we had problems
1583086 in most cases the government agrees admits its errors and changes its policies sometimes the government does not want to admit that it has broken the rules of the olympic charter and then we apply suspensions
1583087 but you know ive shot against him three times and ive won twice so i think im better
1583088 the level of archery is really going up because korean coaches are going everywhere
1583089 it hockey is a family sport i think thats the reason why you have a lot of brothers as all the family members play
1583090 so there is always the possibility of brothers playing together in the national team
1583091 we know each other so well that we communicate by eye contact on the field
1583092 benjamin shows me the right side with his eyes i know where he will run and get the pass from me
1583093 liu xiang must wake up every morning and see a picture of robles in his head
1583094 one has a really huge amount of pressure on him and the other one has so much to gain
1583095 now its federicas turn to be the focus of attention to take all the pressure when i walk into the pool im no longer the swimmer everybodys looking for
1583096 more things happened to me in the past year than in the three years after my olympic title i dont really feel like the defending champion four years is a long time
1583097 i didnt see her cry at the french championships but when i saw the picture in the newspaper i hoped she would be ok for the olympics to me she remains the 400 meters queen
1583098 the french championship in retrospect did me a lot of good it eased the pressure and showed the other french girls they could also swim at international level
1583099 it was hard on the day but it made me realize that i could be beaten and it was not the end of the world
1583100 my goal is to make it to the three finals and then well see the one that matters most is the 400 meters because its my race but the 200 backstroke is another chance
1583101 showcase the ancient and long history of the chinese nation
1583102 for the lighting of the flame the last torch bearer this is the most secretive part and will be revealed at the very last moment
1583103 we hope and believe the athletes in the olympic games know they should not link the olympic games with politics
1583104 it would run against the charter of the olympics and the spirit of the olympic movement
1583105 as the chinese leadership prepares its display of grandeur and power in beijing it is waging a ruthless campaign of repression inside tibet
1583106 people will use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1583107 it wasnt possible for tibetans to participate like they wanted so this was the minimum we could do to show our presence
1583108 now that the olympic games are finally upon us its a chance to show how tibetans feel and what their hopes are
1583109 outsiders may think that the tibetans are treated very well and that they are happy but the truth is that tibetans are not free to speak of their suffering
1583110 even if i had to sacrifice my life for this message to be seen by the dalai lama i agree and welcome this chance
1583111 it is very difficult for tibetans to go to beijing and speak out there so that is why we decided to show the real feelings of tibetans inside tibet through this film
1583112 siento el dolor que he causado por favor no odien que esto les otorgue la compensaci n emocional que est n buscando

1583115 los tibetanos y sus seguidores en todo el mundo condenan el intento del gobierno chino de usar los juegos de 2008 para cubrir su ocupaci n del t bet y su actual campa a de represi n sobre los tibetanos que luchan por sus derechos b sicos y libertades

1583157 im desperate because i didnt raise my son to be a fighter at home we gave him love and tenderness good food education health care his siblings always considered him the most lovely person in our family

1583165 to all those who have drawn the inference from my words that africa as a continent is somehow genetically inferior i can only apologize unreservedly that is not what i meant more importantly from my point of view there is no scientific basis for such a belief
1583166 all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours whereas all the testing says not really
1583167 people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true

1583172 the main focus of the campaign is that we dont believe these companies should be assisting the chinese government to censor the internet from its citizens
1583173 the campaign is to end internet censorship in china but focusing specifically on companies that are internationally recognised and people around the world to say that we expect more from those companies
1583174 these are clear indications that these companies arent aware of what their corporate and social responsibilities are
1583175 theyre the kinds of things that many customers dont know about and are clear ways where the companies could stop assisting the chinese government in censoring its citizens

1583179 for him to hold his hands on her neck took premeditation and malice
1583180 it wasnt enough that he killed her maliciously he continued that malice by lighting her funeral pyre
1583181 he tried to touch me in my private area again and i bent his arm back again

1583198 private security providers continue to enter the battle space without coordinating with the u s military putting both the military and security providers at a greater risk for injury
1583199 a real hard look at security contractors on future battlefields and figure out a way to get a handle on them so that they can be better integrated if were going to allow them to be used in the first place if they push traffic off the roads or if they shoot up a car that looks suspicious whatever it may be they may be operating within their contract but to the detriment of the mission which is to bring the people over to your side i would much rather see basically all armed entities in a counter insurgency operation fall under a military chain of command

1583206 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1583207 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones
1583208 the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house the confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
1583209 they later changed the charge to holding a dance party and collecting money to support terrorism
1583210 during the raid the police mocked questioned and harassed the christians for four hours
1583211 then they took them to a police station where the head of the station interrogated them the head of the police then wrote down their statements in arabic and forced the christians who are immigrants and not able to read or write arabic to sign the statements
1583212 three weeks ago saudi arabia hosted an interfaith conference in madrid spain during the conference that took place from july 16 19 king abdullah of saudi arabia called for reconciliation among various religions

1583232 i go to a mortuary every trip to baghdad and i stand there all morning counting the corpses in the last monday i was there four weeks ago there was a woman with her hands tied behind her back shot three times in the head and a baby that had been shot in the face others are clearly blown up by suicide bombers in which case they come in in bits and they try to fit the bits together
1583233 we came across these large numbers of iraqi soldiers who had been blown to bits and the dogs had arrived it was lunchtime you see and they were tearing bits of bodies off and racing off across the desert with arms and legs to eat
1583234 why are you wasting your time theyll never show this
1583235 and i remember thinking they ought to show it this what the war is about this is what happens every time if you go and see saving private ryan you can see it but when its real youre not allowed to they clean up the war
1583236 if you go down into galway and theres been a bomb and lets hope there never is and there are people all over the road dead you get angry about it furious about it
1583237 well im allowed to get angry too and im allowed to name the people who did it if i think i can find out i was just down the road when this guy blew up in jerusalem and killed lots of israeli kids there was a child with his eyes blown out do you think im going to give equal time to hamas no i write stories about the victims
1583238 very distressing i was endlessly writing about gas and torture and death

1583257 it appears unlikely that any alternative to kerosene as an aviation fuel will be in widespread use by 2030
1583258 if the infrastructure was not available the growth in traffic would not materialise
1583259 an incentive for going beyond the minimum its giving people both carrot and stick we want to see the building industry enthusiastically coming along not fighting us
1583260 the instances of that reducing levies would be with regards to the water and sewage impact if your development is self sufficient in terms of water its creating less demand for the capital investment
1583261 lower impact developments could be allowed relief on certain development taxes
1583262 more local authorities could include in their development plans a provision that states that when a project is borderline on particular issues with respect to planning permission its environmental sensitivity could be taken into account as a balancing factor planning authorities have the ability to try to encourage developers to raise the bar developments could get extra points essentially for adopting an environmentally sensitive strategy this could encourage it more
1583263 yes it is but the whole energy issue in buildings is something thats come to the fore much more recently
1583264 in the argument about one off houses in this country many local authorities have a simple no policy unless youre an exceptional applicant which usually means that you have connections to the area in question
1583265 more properties were fitted into the space because we have good public transport and good cycling facilities i think there were 50 per cent less car parking spaces compared to a conventional development
1583266 youve got to get the planners to understand that youve got to have innovative architectural solutions so you dont lose amenity space when you increase the density conventional designs wont work
1583267 developers arent prepared to be honest and discuss their finances with the local authority in order to negotiate a planning gain also estate agents try to kill off innovation because they cant predict the sale values
1583268 i think probably the main thing which would facilitate higher density would be reduced car parking if you take car free developments in other countries the reduced road space and car parking space can be shared to allow for improved open space and higher density building
1583269 i dont really see how we could justify higher densities in terms of higher energy efficiency planners are already trying to get housing to be built at a higher density
1583270 it could be the case if these were seen as enormously difficult requirements bu they only appear to be big changes because weve built to very low standards i dont think it necessarily has any impact its a great regret that these standards werent introduced at the start of the building boom ten years ago
1583271 we talk about fast tracking infrastructural projects to me fast tracking the eco village concept would be the best way of doing it
1583272 evidence that we are breaking the link between economic growth and waste generation
1583273 certain proportion of irish waste exported to eu countries is shipped onwards within and outside of the eu
1583274 were doing very well in some ways we havent be doing it as long and we have caught up quickly but i believe it is possible to recycle 90 per cent of everything defined as waste were not doing nearly as much as we could
1583275 where it can be turned into value added products it creates new business and new innovations and profits can be used to fund community projects
1583276 bringing in methods from europe where theyve been making mistakes for years we have a chance to do something innovative and new here
1583277 i believe that waste is the new gold mine of the 21st century
1583278 its a no brainer to make products out of our resources its just about having a holistic whole systems approach

1583294 the prodigal sons sentimental side has sometimes overshadowed other important themes making it a challenge to interpret the parable accurately
1583295 simplicity can be deceptive by focusing on what you think you understand it is possible to miss what is really there

1583299 the real issue in the parable is pride versus humility there are more older brothers than younger brothers in todays church

1583321 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1583322 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1583323 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1583324 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity

1583334 she couldnt pass a library even in a town she had never been in without getting emotional
1583335 the library in the days of mary jo hutchings was a major factor in the education of the young
1583336 in that sense she felt her responsibility was to make this reservoir of knowledge in mount prospect a place where young people especially would develop creative thinking
1583337 the greatest lesson she ever taught me was that to achieve happiness you have to look outward and serve other people
1583338 when they announce your name and when the gold medal goes to you while youre out on the podium its pretty neat
1583339 i think it would be really neat to have the games in the city

1583353 i hope that corey would be happy with what we have been doing because everything we are funding were his favorite projects
1583354 the system costs more but you recapture your money within three to five years

1583368 a donated organ can save a life but at whose expense will the organ trade lead to an economic allocation of resources where only those who can pay will stand a better chance of survival in receiving an organ transplant will an organ be treated like a commodity
1583369 is it fair to criminalize such social relationships where no third party is harmed when a social relationship is forged which gives a new lease of life to both the stakeholders then law ought not to step in to criminalize and punish such relationships
1583370 organ donation even if it involves valuable consideration may make life better for both parties who find no way out of problems of health or poverty if the state and the altruists cannot help the poor in overcoming their problems it ought not to raise more barriers for them

1583405 if you are not prepared to take the action that needs to be taken if you cannot keep up and stay on top of things then you should leave this city government right now
1583406 the behavior exhibited by public employees is unacceptable i am furious at their actions
1583407 policies and procedures thats slightly abstract you had a real live person here who needed love and needed support and adults failed this person badly
1583408 this is serious work the fate of a child or a family could be in your hands
1583409 thats not to be taken lightly its not to be pushed over to the side its not to put papers in files some place and think the problem is going away
1583410 i had always felt that all things being equal probably the two biggest toughest hires were going to be police commissioner and dhs commissioner
1583411 it is so tragic it is so dehumanizing it is just astounding to me
1583412 ive just never read anything like that i hope to never read anything like that again
1583413 it just seemed to me that whatever other personnel actions were going to be taken would have been taken at that time
1583414 the department of human services thats characterized in the grand jury report is from 2006
1583415 there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that this department will turn around
1583416 despite the exceptional nature of danieals situation not one supervisor gave her case extra attention or offered any guidance to laura sommerer
1583417 those responsible for checking on her safety seemed to think she must be fine as long as she was alive even if she was sitting alone in a stroller in a dark room all day wasting away
1583418 the actions or inactions of these supervisors might arguably be considered criminal
1583419 the grand jury has decided however to focus its criminal charges on those individuals who were most directly involved in danieals neglect and death
1583420 a share of the stain of responsibility for danieals death remains on their hands

1583423 shunt dependence puts the patient in a very precarious situation

1583425 every time the kid has a headache they are worried about a failure every time she has a fever they are worried about a shunt infection
1583426 there is a lot of work to do to develop credible clinical evidence that what he is doing will yield outcomes that are equivalent to the standard treatment
1583427 we are rooting for him but glad we are not him
1583428 it will require a lot of very rigorous scientific study
1583429 my guess is that it will almost certainly be the best treatment for somebody
1583430 but i dont know if that is one in 100 or 60 in 100 babies

1583433 we really have to look at why were doing it
1583434 i think it is something we will ultimately have to do
1583435 i think it is apparent that the people who prepared this get an f
1583436 it validates the concerns we raised but it doesnt provide any viable solutions
1583437 to date the parties conducting todays hearing have not yet acknowledged the significant public benefits this transaction would provide to the regional economy and to dozens of chicago area communities that would see a reduction in freight traffic as a result of the transaction
1583438 the reality is that if this transaction were approved more than 60 communities would experience rail congestion relief roughly two times the number that would see increased rail traffic
1583439 the negative impacts that are measurable far outweigh the measurable benefits
1583440 approval of this rail sale will be totally life changing
1583441 if they want to operate on that line then they have the obligation to pay for the mitigation
1583442 thousands of people in towns that abut the existing cn lines stand to benefit from reductions in rail and highway congestion a decrease in train noise and relative improvements to safety
1583443 it would also set the stage for possible enhancements to metra service
1583444 the way to resolve the problem is not to shift the problem its is to not make it a problem for anyone
1583445 we need to take a step back and see how we want to move freight traffic through the region
1583446 the demand for inverters by domestic consumers has gone up so much in the last one month that it has become difficult to meet the market demand
1583447 we have sold around 2 000 inverters in the nine months preceding july but in july alone we have sold 1 000 after load shedding returned to the city
1583448 this business was so far seasonal with sales hitting their peak during the summer months it is the first time that the demand for inverters has taken off sharply during the monsoon season
1583449 i had to shell out rs 20 000 for installing the inverter i needed it immediately and could not wait for the battery to get fully charged as it would have meant suffering power cuts for three more days
1583450 we are fed up with the increase in demand and have even kept our telephone switched off as we are unable to meet the demand we have been selling almost 200 units per day for the last 10 days and we have run out of stock
1583451 sad to lose a lawyer of such skill determination and professionalism

1583456 i have to think about all the deaths in this county that are the result of guns all the kids who are dead because of guns

1583458 they were trapped against the metal breakwall and were getting battered by pretty big waves
1583459 i deployed a disc from about 40 yards out to get to the male and reeled him in
1583460 it was a lucky toss and she got a hold of it
1583461 it sounds like she got sucked out first and they stood on a rock for a little while
1583462 when the water died down they thought they could make a break for it but then they got caught in a revolving door of waves
1583463 i dont know anyone who is an exceptional enough swimmer who could have gone out there
1583464 i was just doing what any of us would have done it really was a team effort
1583465 whats really crucial is we are trying to be as fiscally responsible as we can
1583466 i think our school district is appealing to a lot of people

1583469 our naturalist guided field trips are fun interactive and full of natures serendipity

1583474 we fully support her first amendment rights but theres a greater issue here is this the language that can be used to best promote her car wash shes using a double entendre that could leave a negative impression of her business and the city
1583475 that is protected speech commercial speech particularly since the mid 1990s is entitled to a fair amount of protection under the first amendment
1583476 theres nothing obscene about that at all they ought to lighten up and have a sense of humor in my mind its a gross overreaction

1583483 real estate prices in maharashtra are already high and the state government insists on buying land instead of giving them on lease the governments of karnataka and andhra pradesh on the other hand are very open in their approach

1583558 i told him yes 32 years ago the man said he bought the watch at a pawn shop here in the city and contacted me when he saw my name engraved on the back
1583559 im going to go give 100 per cent and see where it takes me
1583560 he started judo with us as a six year old in our tykes program
1583561 he was very shy and didnt like the attention on himself so then we worked him up to trying a tournament out of town and worked him through those ranks then hed only go to the tournaments if his dad went finally we broke him out of that shell and broke him through each level its a great case of a kid who put his mind to something and hes on the international scene if we can keep him injury free and keep him motivated i think he could do well its hard to say what would happen in four years for the 2012 olympics in london
1583562 against those guys its all survival if you can not get thrown thats good
1583563 it definitely showed me what i have to be to reach the olympic calibre
1583564 ive worked my way up from the bottom and ive paid my dues
1583565 im finally hitting my stride and its all coming around im really thankful and i feel very blessed
1583566 i was born in quesnel because we were on our way to williams lake for a race and my mom went into labour so my dad dropped us off at the quesnel hospital and he came back on sunday and my mom says we had a boy and my dad said i won the main so ive been racing my whole life but i just started driving this year
1583567 on saturday he ran on the inside of me and the outside and every time we drove by the start finish line there were people standing up screaming because this kid was all over me
1583568 and he never touched me one time it was really clean awesome racing
1583569 then on sunday he got up on the outside of me after 10 laps we ran for four laps side by side and that was just amazing racing unluckily for him he got a caution flag but it was very lucky for me he poked his nose down on the inside and had a look on the last lap but i held him off
1583570 i had a miss in the engine on thursday night and i couldnt figure it out
1583571 kalem he came down and he worked on my car for six straight hours he went through every single thing you could possibly go through and he eventually found that miss was because of a clogged injector port thats what led to this whole weekend we ended up having just an amazing amazing weekend
1583572 being congruent is absolutely critical to your success you can dress up the outside as pretty as you want but if the inside doesnt match it will easily be communicated through the morphegenic field to those you encounter
1583573 today i am going to do at least one small thing i wouldnt have normally done is a good behavioral adjunct to hypnotic approaches although of course the hypnosis itself will also be promoting this behavior
1583574 clearly hypnosis played an important role in achieving my goal could i have done it without maybe i think that it is not a pill you take and expect a solution to your problem you must set yourself into action to achieve the goal you have in mind become congruent in your words and actions and the results will naturally follow i am very confident i can use hypnosis to aid in any of my future goals it is important to give yourself as much help as possible when making a commitment to change this is like having another tool in your tool box ready to use on the job
1583575 i think self hypnosis and this experiment has definitely helped me to commit to my goal and take it seriously it had been a great experience self hypnosis worked for me and thats why recently ive also bought other tapes because i think its a good way to enrich your goals easily the experiment made me really committed in listening to the tape every single day for 21 days otherwise i dont think i wouldve listened to the tape every day it gave me an extra boost of motivation which i felt was really good support for keeping up with my goal
1583576 it may have played some role in my progress but in conjunction with goal setting and being in a group of like minded people i may continue to use my tape in conjunction with vision boards affirmations and eft however i feel nothing works as having a will written achievable goal and a realistic plan to reach it
1583577 oh yes it has one of the main reasons i took up this hypnosis project was because i wanted to work on myself and see if there were any psychological blocks that were subconsciously preventing me from attracting mr right to that extent this hypnosis has helped me in becoming a better version of myself im not talking of extreme makeovers here but rather channeling my natural confidence into the area of relationships through the hypnosis i actually learned to accept that i could just be myself and more importantly to make subtle changes and improvements in myself that make it so much more easier to relate to others so i can go out there and impress people and still be my own self if there is one thing i have taken away from this project it is the confidence in myself and an ability to look at myself objectively this becomes very important when i am looking at other goals in my life so that i can easily pinpoint areas of improvement without any hang ups and oh by the way i am planning to meet somebody next week so in a way the hypnosis tape still has some work to do frankly i really enjoyed the experiment i came here with an open mind on this and treated this as a tool rather than a panacea for my challenges but i also had some unexpected side effects such as being fitter amp slimmer as i became more conscious of my diet and yoga workouts better time management amp organizational skills most importantly ive learned to just chill life is great when you feel great other things will just follow of their own accord
1583578 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power

1583582 not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
1583583 that you could have freely received by faith in jesus christ but you didnt because of your sinful pride and love for sin john 3 20 you could have went to heaven simply by the taking but you went to hell because of your sinful unbelief and contempt for the lord jesus christ you

1583586 what can i do today to take a step closer to my goals
1583587 im ashamed to say that there were folks even in the medical department who said over my dead body will american civilians see this
1583588 the average joe surgeon civilian or military has never seen this stuff
1583589 yeah theyve seen guys shot in the chest but the kind of ferocious blast burn and penetrating trauma thats part of the modern i e d wound is like nothing theyve seen even in a manhattan emergency room its a shocking heart stopping eye opening kind of thing and they need to see this on the plane before they get there because theres a learning curve to this

1583593 when you havent done it before its more of a concept
1583594 youre making this album but you dont really know what it entails when it came right down to it it made more sense to stick the groups together and see what would happen

1583605 for 2009 we expect prices to start coming under pressure as oversupply becomes evident in dubai we forecast a 10 per cent decline between 2008 and 2010 in our base case
1583606 while we expect these price declines to be limited to dubai given the level of undersupply in surrounding markets we cannot rule out a contagion effect on the middle east north africa property shares prices as investor confidence suffers
1583607 no i dont think so you have to take into account the population growth coming over 40 000 units are required each year to keep up with this in addition to the pent up demand from those people living in sharjah and ajman
1583608 if anything all those people living in other emirates will start coming back into dubai

1583618 our job is to run an airline and not to build it is a defensive strategy rather than a proactive one simply because we have a galley manufacturer who has been causing us some problems

1583653 dubya as bold leader doing unpopular things to fight the evil hordes
1583654 but if we say that batman should kill the joker doesnt that imply that we should torture terrorism suspects if theres a chance of getting information that could save innocent lives of course terrorism is all too present in the real world and batman only exists in the comics and movies so maybe were just too detached from the dark knight and the problems of gotham city so we can say go ahead kill him but if anything that detachment implies that theres more at stake in the real world so why arent we tougher on actual terrorists than we are on the make believe joker

1583724 do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well
1583725 thank you you can stay with me forever and ever now
1583726 she just stopped for no real reason and then i had to stop what did she have to stop for
1583727 but the whole thing only took about three seconds and youre already out of there
1583728 after tossing her books on the sofa she decided to grab a snack and get on line she logged on under her screen name byangel213 she checked her buddy list and saw goto123 was on she sent him an instant message
1583729 this man has just told us a most interesting story about you
1583730 i am a police officer and your online friend goto123
1583731 thats impossible goto is a kid my age hes 14 and he lives in michigan
1583732 i know i told you all that but it wasnt true you see shannon there are people on line who pretend to be kids i was one of them but while others do it to injure kids and hurt them i belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators i came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to talk to people on line you told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you you named the school you went to the name of your ball team and the position you played the number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze
1583733 no i live in raleigh it made you feel safe to think i was so far away didnt it
1583734 i had a friend whose daughter was like you only she wasnt as lucky the guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone yet they do it all the time on line the wrong people trick you into giving out information a little here and there on line before you know it you have told them enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it i hope youve learned a lesson from this and wont do it again tell others about this so they will be safe too

1583738 i thought i could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed
1583739 since i started playing as a child i have always dreamed of playing in serie a
1583740 now that i have achieved that aim i want to give everything as i always have and i have added motivation
1583741 people say that i am like a young toni that doesnt scare me on the contrary it pleases me
1583742 i am tall and good in the air but i also like to get the ball at my feet and to run from behind
1583743 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1583744 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1583745 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1583746 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1583747 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1583748 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1583749 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1583750 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1583751 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1583752 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1583753 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1583754 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1583755 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1583756 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1583757 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1583758 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1583759 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1583760 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked

1583765 he that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else
1583766 the greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution
1583767 its very hard to get your heart and head together in life in my case theyre not even friendly
1583768 i think the citys comprehensive and strict measures to control pollution have paid off
1583769 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1583770 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank
1583771 yes there are problems but that does not mean those problems are going to continue
1583772 in all developing countries you put objectives and sometimes you dont reach them
1583773 they are determined to spend this money on development they see it as a priority

1583781 google always believes profoundly that mutual interest rather than monopoly is the key to sustainable growth
1583782 is to check various laws and ordinances and to see where we can go
1583783 and well check it out well do a survey first
1583784 in any event i think the city is doing well with collecting its taxes people should pay
1583785 who knows why the owner didnt pay his taxes if he was ill or lost a job the bible says not to cast judgment
1583786 look ive heard of judges who when they look at things like this they say if there wasnt a hurricane or a snowstorm to keep people away from the foreclosure sale think to themselves what purpose is served by doing it again all you do is run up more attorneys fees and advertising and sign costs and so forth
1583787 we used to always think of this industry as the cycle
1583788 i think the reality now is there are several sub cycles
1583789 its hard now to talk about the cycle i think we have to talk about all of the cycles
1583790 the way we think about it at thq is we plan our business around each of those platforms not around the cycle
1583791 with so many great platforms each with distinct capabilities reaching different audiences we believe it is more important than ever before to segment the market when determining our publishing strategy
1583792 we always ask our children when anyone and everyone is coming to visit because it is their home the only home they have and they heartily agreed
1583793 the children see him as a kind uncle coming to visit not in his official position
1583794 there are geniuses poets artists and physicians among the kids who call mercy their home and yet they are labeled as klong toey children and not the children who are worthy of proper education and jobs
1583795 the visit of mr uncle president is telling them they are of great value and not to believe any of the bad stuff people might say
1583796 yes things are tough here in thailand the streets and slums are rough we have been beaten up used and abused but today is fine and tomorrow is going to be even better and today we are going to have as much fun as we possibly can

1583804 the only begotten son of god wanting to make us sharers in his divinity assumed our nature so that he made man might make men gods
1583805 christ is present whole and entire in each of the species and whole and entire in each of their parts in such a way that the breaking of the bread does not divide christ
1583806 this presence is called real it is a substantial presence by which christ god and man makes himself wholly and entirely present
1583807 in the liturgy of the mass we express our faith in the real presence of christ under the species of bread and wine by among other ways genuflecting or bowing deeply as a sign of adoration of the lord
1583808 it is christ himself the eternal high priest of the new covenant who acting through the ministry of the priests offers the eucharistic sacrifice
1583809 by the consecration the transubstantiation of the bread and wine into the body and blood of christ is brought about christ himself is present his body and his blood with his soul and his divinity cf council of trent ds 1640 1651
1583810 holy communion because by this sacrament we unite ourselves to christ who makes us sharers in his body and blood to form a single body
1583811 but the celebration of the eucharistic sacrifice is wholly directed toward the intimate union of the faithful with christ through communion to receive communion is to receive christ himself who has offered himself for us
1583812 the whole church is united with the offering and intercession of christ the pope is associated with every celebration of the eucharist wherein he is named as the sign and servant of the unity of the universal church

1583828 tremendous he threw strikes he looked like hed been out there before he looked like he had tremendous poise what a shot in the arm for us
1583829 i was more nervous in the clubhouse before the game than on the mound

1583839 im not going to look a gift horse in the mouth thats one of the most interesting plays i think youll ever see
1583840 while i was running to second i watched the whole thing transpire it was kind of weird because everything is happening that fast all at once you cant really tell whats going on and youre just waiting for it to end to really take a look the ball rolled on the wall for 10 feet and he came in and pulled down the offensive board it was even more amazing to see it on the replay
1583841 i should have caught the ball it hit in the pocket of my glove ross did a great job he jumped up and grabbed it
1583842 the biggest thing is you look around and nobody is counting on you to be that guy
1583843 youre just a complementary piece of that puzzle since ive been here ive had two guys on base every second or third time i get up there thats a testament to the lineup
1583844 just coming over here im trying to be comfortable and trying not to do too much i think thats probably helped simplify it obviously some success early helps you relax a little bit
1583845 anytime you have two pitches you can throw for strikes it makes it tough
1583846 i had a good fastball and a good curveball i cant pinpoint one pitch i got more outs with
1583847 i was just trying to keep it close and get to our good bullpen guys

1583956 i went to jamaica by myself which is maybe not the best idea
1583957 one of the things i find exciting about it is that whenever you hear the rock legends of the 60s talk about their youth they were all sitting with their little transistor radios in england listening to radio luxembourg to get the newest rock n roll records
1583958 well in jamaica they were doing the same thing because the music was coming down from memphis floating over the caribbean sea and they heard it and reinterpreted it with their island sensibility
1583959 i couldnt relax because it was obvious that the people were struggling so much
1583960 it was surprising to me to see this man take my guitar sit down in the sun and tune my guitar for me
1583961 we realized right away that when a man can play an instrument and sing along with it he has something in common
1583962 i started singing harmony with him and we just clicked
1583963 when i met him he said he was peter toshs best friend that hed been a reggae star in the 70s and so of course you say sure whatever
1583964 but when i went back to my hotel i asked the concierge do you know this guy that plays guitar on the beach moses that was claudius street name
1583965 in jamaica they have these expressions like soon come which means i could see you in five minutes or i could see you in two weeks
1583966 and when somethings down the road it could be next door or it could be miles down the road so claudius said to meet him at 9 oclock the next morning and when i walked out at 9 oclock there he was well this was unusual he was really committed
1583967 like a shack basically a broom closet with a window and a pair of headphones on the other side was a guy with a computer named brains because hes the brains of the operation
1583968 he understands something very fundamental about how to put a song together thats very exciting which is basically keep it simple get a really great hook and then you can fill in around it
1583969 i didnt know i was an artist when i was in the country
1583970 id go to the studio and record with all the greatest musicians in kingston
1583971 after he got screwed over the first few times he started getting smart and would just hold out until he had the money to put out the records himself
1583972 his single crying time was huge in the u k but a lot of people thought it was actually burning spear
1583973 when bob marley or jimmy cliff saw me and island records founder chris blackwell had given them their big money and their big bmw
1583974 bob would come out of his bmw and forget about where we are
1583975 and today guess who i was talking to jonah ninjaman
1583976 ninjaman stop in the street there and ninja dont talk to nobody else and hes in his big range rover and i have on slippers right now on my feet i have on slippers
1583977 bent down and look him right in the eyes and let him know that i put whatever i have to into the computer i dont take things from the computer and jump and shout that im an artist
1583978 the last things chronologically on that record were produced by jack ruby at his studio in the early 80s and its where the electronic drums come in the style of jamaican music of reggae was changing so claudius fell out of favor or the market just kind of evaporated around him the music business is a trend oriented business
1583979 he had done a bunch of recording in the 90s and he gave the songs to these german women who took the master tapes to germany and basically disappeared
1583980 the one thing he always says to me is that i woke him up again
1583981 he had tried to put music aside to retire and i woke him up again
1583982 just with the way the music industry is in tumult right now nobody bit
1583983 but in a way i think thats for the best because the way the industry is going it may not have served our interests to be involved with a larger label one of the things i am really interest in doing is claudius records are selling on the collectors market for upwards of 200 claudius never sees a penny of that from his point of view i wanted to secure his rights and to make sure that we get some money going back to him for his work
1583984 i spent over a year searching all over the world getting his back catalog together
1583985 every time id get ahold of one id call him up on the phone and play him a record he hadnt heard in 30 years
1583986 old reel to reel tapes that hes kept with him that have all of his biggest songs on them and so were able to present as good a sound quality as you could possibly get
1583987 its actually the multitrack tapes so ive had them restored its really good sounding music that you could only previously hear at great cost off a scratchy 45 thats been played a million times
1583988 we got to go to tuff gong which is great because its bob marleys studio
1583989 but before it was tuff gong it had been called federal recordings and claudius had recorded there a bunch of times under the previous owners so its all very historically rich when we got to tuff gong we went to this pear tree and ate some of these pears which is where when the guys didnt have any money including bob marley they would go to eat before a session
1583990 its a very socially conscious spiritual message a very powerful power to the people message an anti corruption message
1583991 this is such a dark time in the world and the world needs positive music the jamaicans talk about vibes and if you can put out a positive feeling into the world people want it they need something to hang onto right now
1583992 things havent really changed in the industry theres a lot of noise and static about an industry whose monopolistic model no longer really works but underneath all that its a really great time to get into the business anybody can do it the means of production are now in the hands of the workers getting it noticed is still the most difficult part promotion is still crucial to your success its only really the delivery method thats changed were working with morphius here in baltimore theyre our worldwide distributor and our baltimore connection to this whole thing which i like
1583993 theres a lot of opportunities coming up for us in the u s canada and even some interest overseas
1583994 it has to be a live show thats how were going to have a successful business how were going to let people know about the records

1584011 the main focus of the campaign is that we dont believe these companies should be assisting the chinese government to censor the internet from its citizens
1584012 the campaign is to end internet censorship in china but focusing specifically on companies that are internationally recognised and people around the world to say that we expect more from those companies
1584013 these are clear indications that these companies arent aware of what their corporate and social responsibilities are
1584014 theyre the kinds of things that many customers dont know about and are clear ways where the companies could stop assisting the chinese government in censoring its citizens

1584038 i think in particular two of the gentlemen id be very very concerned if the ship sailed because i wouldnt think that they may want to stay on board
1584039 they could do something stupid and were very mindful of that
1584040 the obstacle is the captain supposedly hes working off the companys instructions and wont allow these guys to come off and what were saying is were looking for the charterers and the port and the state and federal governments to override that and to say the ship cant be allowed to leave until those guys come off

1584126 nulla risultato circa lidentit dellinformatore perch tutti i giornalisti indicati come testi si sono avvalsi del segreto professionale il pm ha chiesto che gli stessi venissero obbligati cos come previsto dallarticolo 200 terzo comma cpp a deporre sul punto ma il collegio ha respinto listanza la norma appena menzionata assicura invece una piena tutela al segreto professionale dei giornalisti consentendo una deroga soltanto in via di eccezione e quindi di stretta interpretazione prevede limposizione dellobbligo a deporre in presenza congiunta di due precisi requisiti quello dellimpossibilit di accertare la veridicit della notizia se non attraverso lidentificazione della fonte della stessa e quello dellindispensabilit della notizia ai fini della prova del reato per il quale si procede se questi sono gli stretti limiti di operativit della deroga sembra evidente che lobbligo a deporre sarebbe stato imposto non gi ad accertare la veridicit della notizia che pacificamente in questo caso erano vere e non richiedevano alcuna verifica in tal senso bens ad individuare lautore del reato di rivelazione di segreti del quale oltretutto il giornalista avrebbe potuto eventualmente essere anche partecipe violando cos la tutela del segreto sulle fonti giornalistiche accordata dal legislatore
1584127 nellinteresse della giustizia della sicurezza nazionale nonch a fini di prevenzione di disordini o di delitti
1584128 di tale diritto fosse logico e conseguente corollario anche il diritto alla protezione delle fonti giornalistiche fondando tale assunto sul presupposto che lassenza di tale protezione potrebbe dissuadere le fonti non ufficiali dal fornire notizie importanti al giornalista con la conseguenza che questi correrebbe il rischio di rimanere del tutto ignaro di informazioni che potrebbero rivestire un interesse generale per la collettivit
1584129 se la libert di informazione e di critica insopprimibile bisogna convenire che quel precetto pi che il contenuto di un semplice diritto descrive la funzione stessa del libero giornalista il venir meno ad essa giammai lesercitarla che pu compromettere quel decoro e quella dignit sui quali lordine chiamato a vigilare
1584130 lesistenza di una vera e propria libert di cronaca dei giornalisti comprensiva dellacquisizione delle notizie e di un comune interesse allinformazione quale risvolto passivo della libert di manifestazione del pensiero
1584131 la libert despressione costituisce uno dei fondamenti essenziali di una societ democratica e le garanzie da concedere alla stampa rivestono unimportanza particolare
1584132 il ministro aveva infranto il settimo lottavo e il nono comandamento con frodi riguardanti liva e osservava che ci si sarebbe potuti aspettare che un uomo politico di destra prendesse pi sul serio i principi elaborati con tanta cura da mos precisava che il ministro era stato oggetto di una sanzione fiscale di 100 000 franchi lussemburghesi concludeva che un tale atteggiamento era ancor pi vergognoso poich proveniente da una personalit che doveva servire da esempio
1584133 secondo lopinione della corte il presente caso si distingue dal caso goodwin in un punto fondamentale in questultimo caso lingiunzione
1584134 i limiti definiti per la riservatezza delle fonti giornalistiche esigono da parte sua lesame pi scrupoloso possibile
1584135 le considerazioni di cui devono tenere conto le istituzioni della convenzione per esercitare il loro controllo nellambito del par 2 dellart 10 fanno pendere la bilancia degli interessi in oggetto in favore di quello della difesa della libert di stampa in una societ democratica
1584136 il mandato di perquisizione concedeva quindi agli inquirenti dei poteri piuttosto estesi
1584137 di conseguenza la perquisizione della scrivania dellavvocato ha avuto una ripercussione sui diritti garantiti al giornalista dallarticolo 10 della convenzione la corte giudica peraltro che la perquisizione della scrivania stata sproporzionata rispetto allo scopo previsto sostanzialmente tenendo conto della rapidit con cui stata effettuata
1584138 legittimo secondo i giudici europei accordare una protezione particolare al segreto istruttorio sia per assicurare la buona amministrazione della giustizia sia per garantire il diritto alla tutela della presunzione dinnocenza delle persone oggetto dindagine ma su queste esigenze prevale il diritto di informare soprattutto quando si tratta di fatti che hanno raggiunto una certa notoriet tra la collettivit non solo la corte europea ha ribaltato lonere della prova non tocca ai giornalisti dimostrare che non hanno violato il segreto istruttorio ma spetta alle autorit nazionali dimostrare in quale modo la divulgazione di informazioni confidenziali pu avere uninfluenza negativa sulla presunzione di innocenza di un indagato in caso contrario la protezione delle informazioni coperte da segreto non un imperativo preponderante ci che conta che i giornalisti agiscano in buona fede fornendo dati esatti e informazioni precise e autentiche nel rispetto delle regole deontologiche della professione una bocciatura anche per le pene disposte dai tribunali nazionali secondo la corte europea infatti la previsione di unammenda e laffermazione della responsabilit civile dei giornalisti possono avere un effetto dissuasivo nellesercizio di questa libert effetto che non viene meno anche nel caso di ammende relativamente moderate
1584139 in merito alla lamentata violazione dellart 10 della cedu la corte europea ha affermato che il diritto dei giornalisti
1584140 il diritto dei giornalisti di non rivelare le loro fonti fa parte integrante del loro diritto alla libert di espressione garantito dallarticolo 10 della convenzione larticolo 10 della convenzione cos come interpretato dalla corte europea dei diritti delluomo simpone a tutti gli stati contraenti vista limportanza per i media allinterno di una societ democratica della confidenzialit delle fonti dei giornalisti bene tuttavia che la legislazione nazionale assicuri una protezione accessibile precisa e prevedibile e nellinteresse dei giornalisti e delle loro fonti come in quello dei pubblici poteri disporre di norme legislative chiare e precise in materia queste norme dovrebbero ispirarsi allarticolo 10 cos come interpretato dalla corte europea dei diritti delluomo oltre che alla presente raccomandazione una protezione pi estesa della confidenzialit delle fonti dinformazione dei giornalisti non esclusa dalla raccomandazione se un diritto alla non divulgazione esiste i giornalisti possono legittimamente rifiutare di divulgare delle informazioni identificanti una fonte senza esporsi alla denuncia della loro responsabilit sul piano civile o penale o a una qualunque pena cagionata da questo rifiuto
1584141 il diritto alla segretezza delle fonti di informazioni dei giornalisti contribuisce in modo significativo a una migliore e pi completa informazione dei cittadini e che tale diritto influisce di fatto anche sulla trasparenza del processo decisionale
1584142 il mancato rispetto del segreto professionale limita in modo indiretto lo stesso diritto allinformazione
1584143 gli stati contraenti sono vincolati ad uniformarsi alle interpretazioni che la corte di strasburgo d delle norme della cedu convenzione europea dei diritti delluomo
1584144 alla base delle sentenze goodwin roemen e tillack sulla inviolabilit delle fonti dei giornbaoisti la repubblica italiana ora deve assorbire nel suo ordinamento i principi fissati dalla corte di strasburgo
1584145 questa corte con le recenti sentenze del 2007 ha affermato tra laltro che con riguardo allart 117 primo comma cost le norme della cedu devono essere considerate come interposte e che la loro peculiarit nellambito di siffatta categoria consiste nella soggezione allinterpretazione della corte di strasburgo alla quale gli stati contraenti salvo leventuale scrutinio di costituzionalit sono vincolati ad uniformarsi
1584146 la cedu presenta rispetto agli altri trattati internazionali la caratteristica peculiare di aver previsto la competenza di un organo giurisdizionale la corte europea per i diritti delluomo cui affidata la funzione di interpretare le norme della convenzione stessa difatti lart 32 paragrafo 1 stabilisce la competenza della corte si estende a tutte le questioni concernenti linterpretazione e lapplicazione della convenzione e dei suoi protocolli che siano sottoposte ad essa alle condizioni previste negli articoli 33 34 e 47 poich le norme giuridiche vivono nellinterpretazione che ne danno gli operatori del diritto i giudici in primo luogo la naturale conseguenza che deriva dallart 32 paragrafo 1 della convenzione che tra gli obblighi internazionali assunti dallitalia con la sottoscrizione e la ratifica della cedu vi quello di adeguare la propria legislazione alle norme di tale trattato nel significato attribuito dalla corte specificamente istituita per dare ad esse interpretazione ed applicazione non si pu parlare quindi di una competenza giurisdizionale che si sovrappone a quella degli organi giudiziari dello stato italiano ma di una funzione interpretativa eminente che gli stati contraenti hanno riconosciuto alla corte europea contribuendo con ci a precisare i loro obblighi internazionali nella specifica materia
1584147 i giudici nazionali devono applicare le norme della convenzione europea dei diritti delluomo secondo i principi ermeneutici espressi nella giurisprudenza della corte europea dei diritti delluomo
1584148 e diritto dei giornalisti quello di comunicare informazioni su questioni di interesse generale purch ci avvenga nel rispetto delletica giornalistica che richiede che le informazioni siano espresse correttamente e sulla base di fatti precisi e fonti affidabili costituisce pertanto un limite irragionevole alla libert di stampa la condanna per ricettazione di giornalisti che attenendosi alle norme deontologiche abbiano pubblicato documenti di interesse generale pervenuti loro in conseguenza del reato di violazione di segreto professionale da altri commesso nella specie copia delle denunzie dei redditi di un importante manager francese
1584149 deve adeguarsi alle norme delle convenzioni internazionali ratificate dallitalia e relative ai diritti della persona e al processo penale

1584181 priyankas role is equally interesting in the film but since abhishek plays the lead role he had to get more prominence thus its first trailer showcased abhishek without priyanka there is nothing more than what meets the eye
1584182 we are working on some patchwork of the film and i dont agree to the fact that priyanka has not been given enough exposure in the trailer we had planned to reveal drona first and then other characters thus priyankas presence in the film will be seen in our forthcoming trailer
1584183 last year our theme was digging deep and we knew we had to dig deeper to legitimize ourselves as a program
1584184 and i think were there we know what it takes to win and we know how to work
1584185 there is unfinished business and it is to identify the path of what we need to finish
1584186 thats what were basically shooting for a winning season was fine and all and everything was good but we really just want to win the swac
1584187 no other team has a defense as good as ours
1584188 we say that if our offense could put up 21 points a game just 21 well win the game
1584189 we got better at the end of the season because people started to get confident they started to play better and they started to believe in the system
1584190 this year we have some incoming freshmen who have to learn some things but i believe that once we jell as an offensive unit its going to be hard for us to be stopped
1584191 thats a great accomplishment for our class coming and changing the program around

1584198 i was just trying to keep it close and give us a chance going into the later innings
1584199 what about the guy getting suspended on the night that weve got to face beckett
1584200 it was consistent early on we didnt have a ton to show for it but we took some really good swings
1584201 we hit some balls at people but we stayed at it and ended up having a really good night all round
1584202 if he had not jumped up and grabbed it if it rolls off the other side its a three run home run
1584203 i knew i was going to get suspended but not five games
1584204 maybe two or three games but five games thats a lot
1584205 i was mad because he threw at me three straight times
1584206 but the people at major league baseball have to realize that i stopped before reaching the mound i didnt want to hurt him
1584207 i knew that baltimores daniel cabrera recently got six games i would have thought i would get less than him
1584208 but i talked to some people today and they said that five was about normal
1584209 when you charge the mound there are going to be suspensions and fines when warnings are issued and you hit someone else its really automatic theres no debating it

1584265 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

1584275 i knew i had some good stuff but i didnt know how good i was until i faced a couple of batters
1584276 now that ive done that and i see how much success ive been having ive been trying to build on that success every time i go out there by doing that i think ive proven to myself and the organization that i do more than hold my own at this level and that ill be ready for hitters at higher levels when they decide to move me up
1584277 there are four of us in the pen that can come out and close at any time im just really happy that ive gotten a chance to show my ability and prove that i can hold down the closer role if they need me to in all honesty i dont feel that any of us are any better than another it just depends on what the coaches want to see

1584285 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat

1584287 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1584288 all the fuel stations in the city were surrounded by long lines of motorbikes and cars waiting to buy gasoline

1584299 if the us government could not prove any charges in the last five years how are they accusing aafia now
1584300 if aafia was carrying chemicals or liquids then why didnt the us government prosecute the case in 2003 what stopped them from doing so
1584301 with the us finally admitting custody of dr aafia siddiqui one of the most brutal cases of the suppression of individual freedom has begun to unravel public pressure has at last compelled the us to admit that dr aafia is in its custody while the pakistani government has belatedly begun to admit that it had some responsibility towards dr aafia it has a lot of explaining to do as to who had been detaining her and where she has been since she was picked up from karachi in 2003 along with her three children

1584665 the third time that he walked out he gave me a sly grin as he was able to go home to his family in oyster bay his ponderosa but i swore then that until the ends of time that until he goes to hell without an asbestos suit that id see him in court again and that wish has come true

1584786 what ive discovered in my research is and the department of veterans affairs has now acknowledged it there is a correlation between trauma suffered by vets and subsequent behavioural issues from their kids he said
1584787 they see their parents flipping out and losing it they see breakdown in marriages they somehow take an assumed guilt position and start to feel vulnerable about the whole issue
1584788 i believe this has impacted on this young lady and i think its probably indicative of what may happen to other veterans kids too
1584789 her dad was an icon in the 60s who was dethroned because he went to vietnam he paid the penalty for it mr greatorix said

1584825 but at the end of the day growing the business here is a lot tougher than other parts of the world
1584826 so for us to try and drive well beyond one million ounces well have to look at our whole policy framework and access to ground

1584842 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
1584843 we are going to play much better defense i think you have to give some credit to the australian team because they executed very well
1584844 we broke down on defense and let the other team get open looks
1584845 we cant have mental breakdowns like those because these teams are tough and really know how to shoot the ball
1584846 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first games where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should

1584878 isnt just somebody who has ideas you agree with nor is it just somebody you happen to believe is a good guy
1584879 between a great leader and a great salesman there are similarities of course a great salesman is usually charismatic and likable and he can often get us to do things buy things agree to things that we might not go for on our own and to feel good about it plus a lot of salesmen are basically decent people with plenty about them to admire but even a truly great salesman isnt a leader this is because a salesmans ultimate overriding motivation is self interest if you buy what hes selling the salesman profits so even though the salesman may have a very powerful charismatic admirable personality and might even persuade you that buying is in your interests and it really might be still a little part of you always knows that what the salesmans ultimately after is something for himself

1584897 our relationship is important vital and i believe it is strong
1584898 the north koreans have 11 000 artillery tubes and rockets aimed at the south korean capital so any little thing that we do with north korea makes the south koreans very jittery

1584915 restrict supply to genuine cases of treatment of short term pain
1584916 the adverse side effects and problems happen over a long period of time not usually in short treatment bursts so limiting pack sizes would be the way to go

1584935 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport
1584936 to me the olympics were founded on amateur sport guys go in there and train for four years putting their whole lives on the line to win a gold medal
1584937 if i was running the olympics i would go back to the way it was originally
1584938 gymnastics weightlifting swimming and track and field and marathons thats to me what the olympics is
1584939 it is not about tennis or golf or anything like that
1584940 those are three sports where guys are getting paid a lot of money to play and compete week in and week out it is so professional
1584941 i think having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1584942 and the reason for that is it would bring 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and the revenues that would be going towards the growth of the game of golf
1584943 they olympics would bring us to new markets on a worldwide scale and i cant imagine how big the game can become in countries like china and india
1584944 i think the criticism is that not enough countries play it but i think it is played all around the world and we have so many great players from around the world
1584945 so if it was for our amateur golfers i think it would be great for our professional golfers i am hesitant but i still would like to see golf in the olympics
1584946 not a person who should be out and about in the middle of the night until these allegations are sorted
1584947 there is very little water in the system we are at historic low levels
1584948 there is not enough water in the system to do everything we want
1584949 there is not enough water in the system to bring down the sorts of quantities of water youd need to fill the lower lakes and to handle the evaporation in the lakes and transmission loss that is what youd lose along the way
1584950 even if we did make a decision to not give any allocations upstream there is insufficient water currently in storage less the critical human needs issue for us to viably manage the lower lakes with the amount of water that we have
1584951 that is extremely unfortunate and extremely difficult for the community down there
1584952 it still grips me a year since the books publication

1584970 studies have shown that microbes can survive the shock levels of being launched into space
1584971 and as more and more organisms are discovered under extreme conditions its become more plausible that things could survive in space for the time it takes to go from one planet to another
1584972 one hundred years ago people wondered if animals could go from one land mass to another
1584973 everything that is going on on earth occurred because the meteorites happened to land here but they are obviously landing in other places
1584974 if there is another planet that has the water and all of the things that are needed for life you should be able to get the same process rolling
1584975 the universe is mostly empty space but here and there are special places where complex things can happen clouds of dust planetary surfaces comets and asteroids

1584991 the sector also faces accommodation challenges for people with disabilities
1584992 as the population continues to age adults with disabilities who have been cared for their entire lives by their parents will need alternative accommodation as their parents leave the family home requiring care for themselves
1584993 this government is very much committed to looking for ways to ease the burden and improve the quality of life of our most marginalised members of society
1584994 once i reached the decision the realisation was quite overwhelming
1584995 to be able to just sit and watch the boys in the derby at the weekend knowing that i was on the sidelines was actually quite a relief
1584996 hes a quality player and hes had a fantastic year with collingwood hed probably fit nicely into our side
1584997 hes an exciting player and with our exciting brand of football hed be perfect with our team
1584998 hes a goalsneak and another great forward to fit in with ebo brett ebert and mots daniel motlop
1584999 i think the club would look at it sit down with him and see if hed fit in with our culture and things like that

1585006 there were some people in the courtroom that were taken aback by it
1585007 those were the only words i heard him utter in the courtroom
1585008 he shook his head in response to questions from the judge some shakes of his appeared to be in the affirmative some of them appeared to be in the negative
1585009 then we can look to consider whether in the psychiatrists opinion the accused is fit to stand trial and whether we are proceeding at that point or whether there are fitness concerns that need to be canvassed by the court

1585012 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
1585013 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
1585014 ought to welcome people being able to express their minds and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely it is a mistake
1585015 but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history
1585016 im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation and its ballistic missile programmes
1585017 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1585018 they have got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1585019 you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world
1585020 we know that microbes can exist quite happily in oxidising conditions
1585021 the story possibly could turn out to be the same for mars we dont know yet

1585026 ill have an opportunity to again outline the governments electricity reforms the protections in place

1585047 restrict supply to genuine cases of treatment of short term pain
1585048 the adverse side effects and problems happen over a long period of time not usually in short treatment bursts so limiting pack sizes would be the way to go

1585065 bow down before me or you will never get out of this room
1585066 do you think that you are in control of this situation i am the one that is controlling things i am the one that is dictating how things are going to go if you want to stand there and watch helplessly as time wastes away then be my guest i will not be leaving here until i get what i want do you think that you still have a choice maverick zero do you think that there is some amazing move that you can pull out of your sleeve to instantly incapacitate your four opponents in this room there is no other option for you there is no escape and there is no hope for your friends unless you do what i say and bow down to me
1585067 it is good to be not only on top of the mountain but on top of the world
1585068 i have done what no one else on this world has been able to do and that is bringing the unconquerable maverick zero down to his knees how do you feel now oh mighty maverick zero
1585069 i think you had better make good on your word and get the hell out of my face before something really bad happens to you
1585070 i am a man of my word and i will take my leave now but not because i am cowering in fear from any meaningless threats you have made against me
1585071 i am leaving because i said i would if you complied with my wishes i wish you luck in your futile race against time to try and save people who care nothing about you
1585072 if you would only come to your senses and realize that you should be siding with the dominant force and not against him
1585073 perhaps once your friends have failed their mission if you shout out my name loud enough i might grant you that private audience with me so that i can show you everything that you have been missing out on
1585074 i would rather stab my eyes out with my own sword rather than do such a thing
1585075 i like it when you talk like that my dear
1585076 i like my women feisty and defiant it makes the challenge that much more sweeter however i must leave you now my darling muse as much as i would like to whisk you away to see more of your feistiness up close and personal you have a challenge that you must try and complete i wish you luck in your mission not that it will do you any good
1585077 i can only hope that i have the opportunity to see you one more time in this castle so that i can show you exactly how revolting and disgusting you truly make me feel
1585078 im glad that you think that i have no chance to succeed that will only make me feel that much better when i can laugh in your face when we go out and complete what we set out to do
1585079 as i said to you before this is not the end this is only the beginning
1585080 you think that you were able to extinguish the fires of cruel gorthaurism you could not be any more wrong and soon you will see exactly how wrong you are
1585081 lord scimitar agreed to let us pass if we agreed to his stupid terms dont you have anywhere else to be right now
1585082 i am not bound by lord scimitars terms and nor are any of the other cruel gorthaurists
1585083 we may have an alliance with lord scimitar but we are free to go where we want and do as we want i would watch that tongue of yours or else you are likely to find the three of us sitting here and watching your precious time waste away with you powerless to stop us
1585084 what the hell was your point in coming out here
1585085 lets cut the crap already the cruel gorthaurists have always remained a little distant from the rest of dark jins forces some people have even said that deep down you are not even aligned with dark jin at all
1585086 so many questions to answer but so few answers to give
1585087 the only thing that i can tell you is that the cruel gorthaurists believe in an eye for an eye you took something very important from us before your mission is over here in this castle win or lose i will see to it that you also will have lost something very important as well we never forget a thing and we always carry a grudge even if it is beyond the grave
1585088 you psychos need to get over the fact that gorthaur is dead and he isnt coming back
1585089 how many times can you keep talking about him do you think that by talking about him that you are magically going to bring him back
1585090 you speak with such confidence as if you were in complete control of the world as you know it
1585091 but what if i knew that what you currently perceive as your reality is nothing but an outright lie what if i could shatter your existence with the mere mention of a few words or even a sentence what if i turned your world upside down right now would you still be speaking so confidently
1585092 stop speaking in damn riddles you are wasting my time and i need to continue moving on
1585093 you speak so confidently and so proudly whenever you mention gorthaur and his death
1585094 are you sure that he is dead or is he simply asleep right now waiting until that perfect moment to open his eyes once again and unleash his hatred upon this world once again for one who is so certain that his archenemy is dead i dont see a corpse near that would provide any validation of his claims
1585095 more relevant results because they are rated by real people not robots
1585096 with millions of websites emerging every single day there is no point for search engines to index millions of pages with oozm we can actually limit the number of indexes and allow people to actually narrow down on relevant results that are recommended by real users
1585097 i have over 50 bidders watching my bids and i have answered more than 25 questions so far there are some people who want to grab this for nothing and there are some people that actually understands the business i am looking for someone who actually understands the concept and is willing to keep the site going
1585098 everyone else gets along with me and we dont have any issues they like me its just you that has a problem with me
1585099 to be honest i dont care for you nor like you give it 6 months and we will see how loyal and faithful you are to him we all know your history and the stories
1585100 ive had a few offers here and there just little things its too early to say what im going to do because im still under contract were doing the tour and theres a lot going on so we cant really expect a whole lot right now theres a lot of teaching offers convention things even some modeling

1585222 mother jones after breaking major story on the nras spying gun lobby goes silent
1585223 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1585224 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1585225 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1585226 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1585227 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps

1585237 theyve got nothing to lose and a lot to gain with a young list players fighting for their careers
1585238 one thing in their game though that is very similar to 2007 is the speed in their team they are very quick and they use the ball very well skilful players are really starting to find some form
1585239 it probably did give us a lot of belief as a team the comeback victory
1585240 the runs we have had in the last quarters i think that win has given us the confidence

1585270 in his new short film consciousness researcher peter russell accomplishes something extraordinary
1585271 how is it that something as unconscious as the matter of the brain ever gives rise to something as immaterial as an experience
1585272 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs

1585285 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
1585286 there is a strong trend in the industry of restaurants providing more detailed nutritional information and choice in menu options for consumers
1585287 this is a positive trend and one that consumers have recognized a 2007 consumer survey showed that four out of five customers said there were more healthy options available and more food choices available than there were two years earlier the restaurant industry is committed to responding to the preferences of its customers and helping them make the eating decisions they would like
1585288 the nations 945 000 restaurants provide numerous options to accommodate all types of tastes and eating plans and this includes options for children and their parents to choose from
1585289 indeed cspi fails to acknowledge the essential role of nutrition education physical activity and parental responsibility in childhood nutrition good eating habits and healthy living must be established in the home

1585349 we want to find out if he is indeed christopher chichester
1585350 and if so if theres anything he can tell us about the disappearance and possible homicide of the sohuses
1585351 our experience tells us hes more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory

1585354 to imagine this from a russian perspective you would now have a georgia inside nato
1585355 and georgia borders unto chechnya and it is very hard to think of a more sensitive issue for russians than chechnya and now you would have nato membership right on its doorstep in the north caucasus
1585356 so this is caught up with that it is also caught up now with president medvedevs desire to show a more strident russian foreign policy a more prestige seeking policy this would be a huge blow to his regime if nato could move this close into what are considered vital russian national interests
1585357 after the rose revolution four years ago georgia has truly been the country in the former soviet bloc after the baltic states in the early 1990s to thoroughly remake their country to reform and to install a democratic government that is a functioning independent state although there is of course a long way to go before georgia consolidates its democracy
1585358 it has made tremendous progress and has become a model and a symbol of what can actually be achieved in anti corruption and democracy building and russia doesnt like that but for the west of course if georgia fails if georgia is allowed to fall this means that any hopes that we may have of democracy building in this part of the world in this south eastern corner of europe is going to fail
1585359 its a corridor a very important corridor for oil from the caspian region going to the black sea and the mediterranean through turkey
1585360 so its now an area that has become economically important as well
1585361 across the region from ukraine over the caucasus to central asia there is no country in which the united states has invested so much of its prestige as in georgia which means that if suddenly georgia is allowed to fail and if the united states does not stand up for georgia and georgias integrity and security every government from kiev to tashkent will draw the conclusion that the united states is not a serious partner and in that sense for a very long time it will undermine u s interests in the whole of eurasia
1585362 the fact is that there are so many different proteins and specialized sugars in the breast milk that the moms able to make that help provide immunity its very important for the health of the newborn
1585363 we dont expect many more thai tourists to come because they cannot go see the preah vihear temple
1585364 safma south asia foreign ministers association should talk to the nato forces and to the afghan government that they must not murder journalists and do not kill journalists
1585365 safma is a regional organization safma should broadcast the problems of afghan journalists to the world
1585366 we would like to look into those aspects and to implement them whatever is possible to implement as fast as possible
1585367 the problem with the saarc is that is very rich in pronouncements and very poor in practice
1585368 in fact now there are nine bureaucracies within saarc secretariat itself who enter the whole process they even do not fulfill their responsibility towards us being an associate body for example they do not like civil society intervention in the processes
1585369 and we must recognize that that we are trailing behind and not living up to the expectations of the people
1585370 and in pakistan it is in the process of being legislated but despite the laws as such the right is not recognized legally even if it mentioned in the constitutions and in other countries there is no law we want that this right is recognized and practiced
1585371 we can only hope that the president of the united states elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority for whom the top priority is human survival
1585372 the voices faces and forms that vanished in the hell
1585373 this study should teach us the grave import of the truth born of tragedy and suffering that the only role for nuclear weapons is to be abolished
1585374 children who evacuated buildings or went to work at factories on that day have not returned 63 years on the atomic bomb deprived them of normal life
1585375 one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant

1585380 a federal jury has awarded more than 700 000 to a former queens midtown tunnel employee who said his bosses denied him a promotion and penalized him for taking sick days because he was jewish according to lawyers for the employee the jury in united states district court in manhattan decided on monday that the former employee gregory fishman should get 235 000 for emotional pain and 500 000 in punitive damages mr fishman 45 is also seeking more than 1 million in lost pay but whether he receives anything will be up to the judge in the case lawrence m mckenna to decide
1585381 a dallas county jury awarded 411 339 to an at amp t call center employee this week after finding that race was a motivating factor in the companys repeated failure to promote her additionally the jury agreed that at amp t had created a hostile work environment and retaliated against her when she complained

1585385 e employees of correctional institutions who qualify as security personnel for purposes of the section 7 k exemption are those who have responsibility for controlling and maintaining custody of inmates and of safeguarding them from other inmates or for supervising such functions
1585386 the company may offer employees a 15 minute break during each shift of six or more hours there are normally no guaranteed break periods when the employee is working overtime break periods begin as soon as the employee has removed himself or herself from the scheduled daily work routine all employees working six or more hours in a shift must receive a 30 minute uninterrupted and unpaid meal period the meal period requirements cannot be waived by the employee nor substituted for any other time there may be instances when because of staffing or workloads a meal period may not be available to all staff members if any non exempt employee does not take a meal period as required by the new york state department of labor that employee should notify his or her manager and note this on the timecard so he or she will be compensated for the time unused break periods or meal periods cannot accumulate nor can they be combined
1585387 if an employee fails to take a meal break and does not notify the manager that he did so in direct violation of the policy is additional straight time compensation due if less than 40 hours were worked assuming minimum wage still was received
1585388 in a workweek in which no overtime hours have been worked an employee subject to section 6 of the flsa is considered to be paid in compliance with the flsa if the employees total wages for the workweek divided by the compensable hours worked equal or exceed the applicable minimum wage thus in the situation described above if the employee receives at least the minimum wage for all the hours worked including the time worked because of a missed meal period no additional compensation is due
1585389 is the missed meal period considered work time for purposes of determining overtime compensation
1585390 assume that an employee is regularly scheduled to work 35 hours per week if he or she begins work early or works after the regular finishing time is additional straight time compensation due assuming that even with these unrecorded extra hours the worker received the minimum wage for all hours of work and also assume that a published policy prohibits all forms of off the clock work
1585391 it is the duty of the management to exercise its control and see that the work is not performed if it does not want it to be performed it cannot sit back and accept the benefits without compensating for them the mere promulgation of a rule against such work is not enough
1585392 if an employee receives premium pay that is not otherwise due e g time and one half for working over 8 hours in a day is that an off set against any straight time pay or overtime pay that may be due in that workweek
1585393 under sections 7 e 5 6 and 7 of the flsa certain premium payments made by employers for work in excess of or outside of specified daily or weekly standard work periods or on certain special days are regarded as overtime premiums in such situations the extra compensation provided by the premium rates need not be included in the employees regular rate of pay for the purpose of computing overtime compensation moreover under section 7 h of the flsa that extra compensation described in sections 7 e 5 6 or 7 may be credited toward the overtime compensation payments
1585394 does the department of labor have a guideline for time that is de minimis or subject to rounding off the employer utilizes electronic time clocks that record punched time in one minute increments

1585417 eventually our plans are for the achievement system to become an account based system
1585418 for now the points are just a wow character score as we graduate to that blizzard account system which is right on the horizon it will switch over to a blizzard level
1585419 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing

1585424 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism
1585425 and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1585426 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story
1585427 this has been going on since many days these bangladeshis have become a real threat to the very existence of the indigenous assamese people we have been protesting since a long time now but the people in new delhi do not give importance to our demands at all we have been asking them to deport all bangladeshi migrants immediately and seal the indo bangladesh border but no steps have been taken so far
1585428 most filmmakers are not willing to shell out hefty budgets so even if they are opting to make animation films the films lack quality
1585429 if people shell out rs 20 crore rs 200 million to make mainstream movies to strike a balance they should at least allocate rs 2 crore rs 20 million for childrens films
1585430 childrens films are very demanding they need trick scenes fun animation music popular actors and all that
1585431 the indian film industry has never focussed at making quality cinema for children childrens cinema is a totally neglected sector in india i wont say it never existed it existed only when vishal bharadwaj and santosh sivan made films more recently taare zameen par is a wonderful example of a childrens film
1585432 the indian film industry is very confused about the concept of childrens films and whatever we have is not quality stuff
1585433 parents are also trying to discourage children from watching good films international cinema provides some wonderful films like finding nemo ratatouille kung fu panda and many others
1585434 the indian animation industry is expanding but it still has a long way to go
1585435 i hope we also get the involvement of better directors as the chairperson of this body i feel jawaharlal nehrus vision regarding children was so important and relevant today we need family based cinema
1585436 ideally cfsi should not bear the brunt of not showing quality childrens cinema all filmmakers need to realise that children form a very important part of our society the problem is that filmmakers do not consider a childrens film a commercial film
1585437 today films are not being made for altruistic reasons it is all for personal benefit children form a very minimal section of the audience and most of the halls schedule childrens films for morning and afternoon shows
1585438 but children unless they are in their mid teens or late teens cant go to a film alone so that rules out the possibility of them going for a movie
1585439 we will be directly recruiting about 60 per cent of field staff mainly at the level of police sub inspectors for intelligence gathering through state recruitment board
1585440 the direct recruitment for intelligence operations means these staff will be deputed for intelligence gathering only they cannot be transferred for policing duty
1585441 we are yet to decide about the number of officials to be directly recruited at higher levels than sub inspectors
1585442 we have to device a foolproof recruitment procedure for selection of people to create a first of its kind intelligence cadre in the state
1585443 what we want in candidates is they should have an aptitude and inclination for intelligence gathering as they will have to do on that field only
1585444 but thats the whole point of creating cinema and making movies we at pnc are here to take chances hence were launching a new series called guerrilla flicks not gorilla flicks
1585445 a genre of cinema that dares to see tomorrow therell be comedies action whatever they will be non star non profit films the only qualification to make a
1585446 im shocked to see the so called big filmmakers today only talk about money everyones talking mammoth budgets and ridiculous targets they dont talk about cinema my guerrilla flicks would be about small budgets small stars and big cinema
1585447 arindam mitra is shooting the first film in the series weve finalised 10 films already were lining up some of the most unconventional talents these include some of the biggest ad makers of the country all they need to do is direct the film that they believe in for pnc then theyre free to go wherever they want to go
1585448 every director big or small has this secret wish to make that one movie he always wanted to maybe david dhawan wanted to remake vittorio de sica bicycle thieves hes welcome to make it for us anyone and everyone are welcome
1585449 this is the most polarised situation i have seen in a generation i think before the situation is tackled tempers have to cool down
1585450 one needs to step back from the brink and handle this very carefully its sitting literally on a tinderbox
1585451 it is terrible and the animosities run so deep what is more frightening is that the integrity of the state has come into question the entire situation has been so badly handled for such selfish gains
1585452 cutting off the lifeline to the state by blocking the srinagar jammu highway for several days now is extremely serious
1585453 the fact that the jammu administration had to black out two local television news channels and seal the offices of two hindi dailies for allegedly whipping up communal passions shows the serious fallout of this stir
1585454 i have never seen a situation like this in a very long time but who is responsible
1585455 the authorities have imposed a false curfew in jammu this communal lot from himachal pradesh and punjab who are siding with the protesters have to be isolated and i will ensure that those in the valley do not play into their hands
1585456 but not right away well be doing it next year ill produce a film and its not really a period film it would be a period film but it wont feel like one
1585457 by that i mean itd be very contemporary in terms of actions and emotions but in order to make those actions and emotions credible the plot will be set in the past part of my character might have some thugi traits but i dont play a thug as defined in the history books
1585458 id love to make films for kareena and my sister soha but i dont have to star them in all my productions see initially the whole idea was to give myself a chance to produce films and do the roles i wasnt being offered
1585459 now when im in my first three production being directed by imtiaz ali sriram raghavan and homi adajania i dont mind playing just the producer in future
1585460 there is no political pressure on us it depends on an individual officer whether he succumbs to political pressure or not nobody how so ever mighty he may be will be spared
1585461 the bjp leaders are involved in the swindling the scheme is not benefitting the poor but the bjp leaders
1585462 fdci will continue on its mandate to serve the industry i have confidence in the future of the council and in the strength of the industry to sustain the body
1585463 i do not think it worthwhile to worry about the unknown as in the future of another fashion body at this time
1585464 wifw is the premier fashion week and everyone from designers to buyers know about it this is the 12th edition of the event and fdci will complete 10 years this leaves no scope for confusion about its role
1585465 has grown from strength to strength over the last 10 years and built a brand identity for itself and indian designers at home and abroad fdci has grown in terms of size and definitely impact in fact fdci was hardly known earlier but today it is a council to reckon with she added
1585466 wifw is only one of many instruments to promote the industry the council is doing a lot more in key areas like capacity building sourcing markets and research and development
1585467 this was a very eventful and challenging tenure the most cherished moment was in 2007 when our designers made their debut at the paris fashion week
1585468 i have a feeling of satisfaction as i leave at the end of four years
1585469 i will be working with societies and trusts in the textile crafts and design areas and also with design education i have always supported good initiatives and will continue to do so
1585470 i am delighted to be associated with a brand like nakshatra that has garnered immense popularity not only in india but worldwide i hope this association is amiable and mutually profitable
1585471 katrina is the perfect representation of the young trendy and fashionable woman that nakshatra targets she lends a refreshing look to the brand we are excited about having her on board as the new face for nakshatra
1585472 meine damen und herren aufgrund einer st rung im computer unseres triebfahrzeugs m ssen wir leider in k ln den zug wechseln blablabla
1585473 wir behaupten gar nicht bernat rliche kr fte zu haben
1585474 vorgestellt insbesondere der galgenmann stellte seinen trick sogar vor als
1585475 theres never enough time to do all the nothing you want
1585476 jennifer garner gave the first speech supporting obama and she was very witty clever and funny
1585477 she was followed by her husband ben affleck then matt damon the men gave serious political speeches on how the country needs change
1585478 for a lot of reasons but mostly because i dont like the path this countrys on and if mccain is elected well be continuing down that same path
1585479 ive got rhythm ive go music ive got my man who could ask for anything more
1585480 the cia to forge a letter to bolster his case for the war in iraq
1585481 what does it mean do you suppose if the white house did in fact order the cia to forge a letter in order to bolster its case for the war in iraq
1585482 were just hearing now jack that there may be an effort in the congress to now go ahead and have some hearings on this explosive explosive charge
1585483 it means we should be ashamed as americans bill clinton was impeached for not being honest about his sexual indiscretion
1585484 george bush is not only the worst president in the history of this country hes also the biggest criminal
1585485 the white house called on the cia to concoct this forged letter from the head of the iraqi intelligence agency to saddam hussein it was backdated
1585486 to before 9 11 and indicated one of the main hijackers mohammed atta trained for his deadly mission in iraq
1585487 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1585488 it means we should be ashamed as americans bill clinton was impeached for not being honest about his sexual indiscretion george w bush misled the congress and the public about iraq condoned the torture of prisoners authorized illegal electronic surveillance and refused to comply with subpoenas just to name a few and yet hell walk away scot free times like these make me want to move to new zealand
1585489 call a special session of congress to investigate these charges now to hell with the olympics this is the drama america really wants to see if these charges prove to be true we show the world that were willing to impeach a sitting lame duck president and correct our mistakes in public
1585490 to put it simply the bush administration made you all out for fools then proved themselves right how you ever reelected this bum is beyond me good luck
1585491 if true then bush cheney et cetera deserved to be clapped in irons held for trial and executed for treason
1585492 so why am i not surprised george bush is not only the worst president in the history of this country hes also the biggest criminal and he got away with it all whats wrong with this congress he should have been impeached and criminally charged years ago
1585493 ah to be the torch bearer in this crusade its time to investigate every minute indiscretion of the bush administration suskind is a well respected journalist who finally reveals what could be the truth about our invasion of iraq if bush is innocent of forgery there ought to be no problem with a thorough investigation let the games begin
1585494 suskind woodward and clarke and mcclellan how many more books does the american public need before it realizes that this administration has done something terribly wrong
1585495 call a special session of congress to investigate these charges now to hell with the olympics this is the drama america really wants to see if these charges prove to be true we show the world that were willing to impeach a sitting lame duck president and correct our mistakes in public
1585496 jack of all trades when it comes to the different aspects of the clients it network
1585497 behind the lifesaver like a little kid who hides behind a curtain and doesnt realize his toes are sticking out
1585498 she was so busy snapping pictures she forgot to bring the ladder up
1585499 our colleagues are asking for dialogue because there are already two people dead several injured
1585500 if wed have lost that one it would have been high up there when you can just taste that win those are the toughest and well see in the next few days how much it means to us
1585501 im just trying to get good pitches to hit and drive them
1585502 tonight up until that at bat i dont think i did a real good job im just glad i could contribute a little bit
1585503 they asked me to go out there ill go out there
1585504 i dont think he can repeat that the rest of the year but that was vintage
1585505 but i just dont think in his second start you can have a rain delay after five innings and send him back out
1585506 but there was no doubt they got some base hits before and after that
1585507 but you cant just keep giving games away like that
1585508 were very supportive of izzy and weve stood by him but at some point weve got to get some results
1585509 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1585510 his feeling was that based on where he is he wasnt in the right mindset to play here
1585511 thats where we concluded his conversation that hes not in the right mindset to play here
1585512 we scratched and we clawed and we pulled some runs together ive been talking about that all year long the will to fight
1585513 it feels like youre hitting on sound at that point in time
1585514 hes one of those guys that obviously throws a very plus plus fastball in that situation all i was really trying to do was put the barrel on the ball hes generating so much power with his fastball if you hit it solidly which is going to go a long way
1585515 i can count probably four other times that its been like this
1585516 going back to seattle five hundred homers 600 things like that and now here and cincinnati the first time
1585517 when you need two outs to win the game its a tough loss
1585518 what can you do were all professionals here turn the page
1585519 everything was right i dont know what happened at the last moment
1585520 am i being told something is it time to go to pack it up
1585521 theres always been some doubt with all the things ive been through all the health issues
1585522 i just kept pushing to get to this point im at today one thing ive learned through this whole process is dont take anything for granted cherish every single one of them
1585523 he had the super duper sinker going he was just outstanding hopefully hes not too sore tomorrow its been a long time since hes done this the bulldog was on the attack getting ahead of hitters its big for the team to get mike a win
1585524 he was getting up there as far as his pitch count and he started elevating a little bit and thats a dangerous club over there they swing the bats
1585525 im pretty excited to get one it feels great ill have a chance to reflect on it the next few days
1585526 i just went out there and tried to focus on the mitt as much as possible and keep my mind down in the zone i came in here knowing that they were probably going to take pitches on me because im a rookie coming into a big stadium so i really tried to pound the zone
1585527 thats great nine years of frustration and he took it out on the best team in baseball
1585528 you cant expect the team to go out and put up five or 10 runs every game youve got to get a break in there at some point
1585529 i dont care how much of a scouting report you have when you step in the box the ball is moving its different than words
1585530 he didnt throw the offspeed stuff until the second time around he threw all fastballs and one changeup the first time around he knew what he was doing
1585531 yesterday we were kind of trying to hide chris in the hotel
1585532 i told him to just stay in the hotel and dont come to the ballpark because ive got to make a move after the game and i really dont want people to start looking over their shoulder seeing which guys going to go
1585533 i think the consensus of opinion was that he wasnt given an adequate opportunity to prepare himself to come here
1585534 thats like asking if on halloween theyre going to have trick or treat
1585535 now its federicas turn to be the focus of attention to take all the pressure when i walk into the pool im no longer the swimmer everybodys looking for
1585536 more things happened to me in the past year than in the three years after my olympic title i dont really feel like the defending champion four years is a long time
1585537 i didnt see her cry at the french championships but when i saw the picture in the newspaper i hoped she would be ok for the olympics to me she remains the 400 metres queen
1585538 the french championship in retrospect did me a lot of good it eased the pressure and showed the other french girls they could also swim at international level
1585539 it was hard on the day but it made me realise that i could be beaten and it was not the end of the world
1585540 my goal is to make it to the three finals and then well see the one that matters most is the 400 metres because its my race but the 200 backstroke is another chance
1585541 you always see something new and i dont remember the last time i saw four walks and two hit by pitches in an inning
1585542 but you know ive shot against him three times and ive won twice so i think im better
1585543 the level of archery is really going up because korean coaches are going everywhere
1585544 it hockey is a family sport i think thats the reason why you have a lot of brothers as all the family members play
1585545 so there is always the possibility of brothers playing together in the national team
1585546 we know each other so well that we communicate by eye contact on the field
1585547 benjamin shows me the right side with his eyes i know where he will run and get the pass from me
1585548 liu xiang must wake up every morning and see a picture of robles in his head
1585549 one has a really huge amount of pressure on him and the other one has so much to gain
1585550 he was pitching well but i dont miss him the guy can pitch but it just didnt work out
1585551 these were two hard losses games we had a chance to win
1585552 offensively he may add a little bounce to our lineup which i think is important his overall game and what hes capable of doing is something that interests us
1585553 brendan is a young guy with a lot of future
1585554 when he was playing enough it was kind of acceptable now hes not playing enough
1585555 felipe is a better fit and well see ryan in september
1585556 i dont care how much of a scouting report you have when you step in the box the ball is moving its different than words
1585557 he didnt throw the offspeed stuff until the second time around he threw all fastballs and one changeup the first time around he knew what he was doing
1585558 it was big especially since i didnt come through earlier in the game
1585559 well see in the next few days how much it means to us
1585560 im just trying to get good pitches to hit and drive them
1585561 he makes good pitches and gets good hitters out and then he makes mistakes
1585562 its good to get the first one out of the way
1585563 i felt a bit nervous being away from the mound and the team for such a long time
1585564 but i just focused on doing a good job and locating the pitches thankfully everything worked out
1585565 they could have scored more runs he had a rough day
1585566 i cant do the team much good unless i get healthy weve been trying to treat it for the last couple of days and it hasnt worked
1585567 we had a chance to use him in a less pressure situation but he wasnt effective
1585568 this is the best thing for his peace of mind
1585569 the biggest thing is you look around and nobody is counting on you to be that guy
1585570 youre just a complimentary piece of that puzzle since ive been here ive had two guys on base every second or third time i get up there thats a testament to the lineup
1585571 just coming over here im trying to be comfortable and trying not to do too much i think thats probably helped simplify it obviously some success early helps you relax a little bit
1585572 my mechanics have fallen into place over the last three or four games and im able to throw all of my pitches over for strikes now and stay away from the big inning
1585573 throwing first pitch strikes i had some easy innings and it allowed me to stay out there
1585574 they havent seen me and i havent seen them so they really had no idea how i was going to attack them
1585575 theyre a really good fastball hitting team and sometimes thats what you got to do to win
1585576 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1585577 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1585578 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1585579 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1585580 they are fueling the fire whether it is software or not
1585581 we wanted to win that game and somehow we did these guys cleveland have pressed us hard
1585582 these guys have picked me up so many times its a great feeling out there to know these guys have your back especially the bullpen

1585950 we want to create a development that everyone can be happy with
1585951 the subdivision was draft approved by the ontario municipal board in 2007
1585952 a condition of the approval was that the developer has to file a zoning bylaw amendment to rezone a portion of the lands to environmental protection in order to preserve the area in its natural state for stormwater management purposes this area would be used to channel stormwater

1586040 gene doping is the next major headache for the world of sport
1586041 in 2004 people were starting to talk about its use at the athens olympics this year in beijing the case is even stronger that this will be the first genetically modified games many scientists will say its still not possible but im not taking this for granted we need to assume that its happening its already feasible
1586042 there is no other technology that is likely to change the olympics than gene doping its not possible to detect and theres a good chance that it will never be detectable in any meaningful sense
1586043 this forces the world of sport to reconsider what it does about testing its time for their plans to change its time for the era of human enhancement to take full effect in the olympics
1586044 london 2012 should be watching beijing very carefully to see whats possible there has never been a clean olympics
1586045 the main problem for sports is that there are so many technologies that are under the radar of anti doping that its policies do little more than to point us to successes of anti doping testing
1586046 yes we have no experience with sports people here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
1586047 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks
1586048 i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
1586049 we have to believe that athletes will try anything to get an edge and this might occur at the olympics and we work on that basis
1586050 i suspect it was their choice you would have to talk to them as to what prompted them to do this
1586051 i will say this i am not a scientist but in my view that was unnecessary
1586052 i dont believe there was any statement trying to be made
1586053 i would not carry a mask i do not see a need for that this is not a measure i would recommend unless you have a particular disorder
1586054 i would not say that those people should not carry protection devices if they so feel but i honestly doubt about the efficiency unless they are carrying a new generation of masks i dont know
1586055 the misty air is not a feature of pollution but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1586056 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1586057 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1586058 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1586059 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1586060 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1586061 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1586062 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1586063 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1586064 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1586065 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1586066 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1586067 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1586068 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1586069 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1586070 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1586071 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1586072 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1586073 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through
1586074 i would not discourage athletes from wearing protection devices if they are concerned but i do not think it is necessary i would not wear one whether i was an athlete or not
1586075 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1586076 those who standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1586077 we have had some readings that were above the interim target data but since then they have gone down and been below that level we will evaluate those pollution levels and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1586078 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1586079 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1586080 our economy is in turmoil i dont have to tell the people of youngstown
1586081 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1586082 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1586083 wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
1586084 if we fail to act there are severe indications for national security our economy and our environment
1586085 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1586086 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1586087 thats kind of a tricky question ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1586088 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1586089 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1586090 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1586091 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1586092 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms

1586115 so i just read the add that the seattle humane society is providing free spaying nutering of pitts while that is great that they are offering that service why is it just to pitts what about all the other breeds out there that get pregnat and have puppies that no one can get rid of so they go to the pound or end up abandoned and mistreated will people get their heads out of their asses and realize that pitts are not a horrible breed
1586116 but you cannot go explaining away forever you will find that you have explained explanation itself away you cannot go on seeing through things forever the whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it it is good that the window should be transparent because the street or garden beyond it is opaque how if you saw through the garden too it is no use trying to see through first principles if you see through everything then everything is transparent but a wholly transparent world is an invisible world to see through all things is the same as not to see
1586117 yep thats me at the beach last summer good times
1586118 het begon allemaal zondagavond met een lange treinreis naar schiphol met als hoogtepunt hints doventolk met muziek na een nacht met weinig tot geen slaap stapten we in het vliegtuig gelukkig met chickie annalie de vlucht ging prima zonder vertraging kwamen we aan op het vliegveld van heraklion daar moesten we eerst proberen de medicijnen van annalie terug te krijgen wat helaas niet lukte kort daarna kwamen onze koffers en konden we naar de transferbus deze stopte ontzettend vaak onderweg en wij waren de laatste die afgeleverd werden en wel in malia appartementencomplex mari het appartement was mooier dan we verwacht hadden en we voelden ons meteen welkom alleen probleem nummero twee was onderweg cobie had de verkeerde koffer meegenomen vanaf het vliegveld precies dezelfde koffer alleen niet het arke label na enige telefoontjes kwam het erop neer dat mijn koffer nog op het vliegveld was en dat cobie die andere koffer zo snel mogelijk terug moest brengen de vraag was alleen nog hoe dat moest gelukkig waren de mensen van mari heel aardig en wilde michalos en roula 6 mnd zwanger wel een vriend van hem bellen die ons zou kunnen brengen dus stapten lizan en cobie in de auto van gorgos of was het nou garagamel en toen kwam probleem nummer 3 we hadden afgesproken dat we voor 40 euro een lift heen en terug konden krijgen maar ik had geen contant geld dus ik zou even pinnen staat cobie bij een pinautomaat doet de pinpas het niet volgende automaat ook niet en die daarna ook niet helaas heeft de pinpas van cobie het de hele vakantie niet gedaan lizan schoot te hulp de rest van de dag hebben we niet zoveel meer gedaan uit eten geweest gezwommen en cocktails met gratis raki gedronken in de bar bij ons complex medusa dinsdag en woensdag ook weinig ondernomen veel gezwommen en gerelaxed ook genoten van de heerlijke cocktails en zonsondergang en dinsdagavond gingen we naar chersonissoss om daar uit te gaan maar dit was een grote tegenvaller maar we hebben ons wel vermaakt dinsdagochtend hadden we ons welkomspraatje van arke wat ook niet zon succes was omdat steven niet eens naar ons verhaal wou luisteren en wij waren niet de enige die hem niet sympathiek vonden ook de andere nls die bij het praatje waren vonden hem niet heel gastvrij donderdag hebben we de imbros kloof gelopen dit is een kloof van ongeveer 8 km waar je doorheen kunt lopen om je heen zie je vooral heel veel bergen en af toe wat bomen we moesten al vroeg opstaan omdat het hele reis was om bij de kloof te komen we hebben de kloof in ongeveer 2 uur en 15 minuten gelopen mochten er max 3 uur over doen het was een mooie wandeling en vooral een avontuur om over alle stenen te lopen en niet te struikelen of door je enkels te gaan daarna nog gegeten in frankokastelo een dorpje aan de zuidkust van kreta was ook weer lekker we hebben niet meer in de zee gezwommen omdat er een flinke wind stond en het zand dan heel hard tegen je benen en rug zou slaan en dat was nogal pijnlijk tussen 7 uur en half 8 waren we terug in ons appartement en we hadden geen zin om heel veel moeite te doen voor eten dus zijn we naar het restaurant naast mari geweest en daar hebben we heerlijk gegeten vrijdag uitgerust van de wandeling in de imbros kloof dus zoals vaker die week veel bij en in het zwembad liggen s avonds zijn we naar een echt grieks restaurant geweest met gratis raki minder lekker dan bij medusa borden gooien en het dansen van de sirtaki met zn allen op de straat in een grote cirkel en daarna de muziek volgen linkerbeen rechterbeen achterstap linkerbeen rechterbeen enz daarna waren we van plan naar een karaokebar te gaan maar het was daar heel rustig dus alleen een cocktail gedronken in de hangmatten en daarna nog eentje bij medusa met een gratis raki zaterdag kwam er s avonds weer iemand van arke om te kijken of we nog een excursie o i d wouden boeken we waren eigenlijk van plan om naar een waterpark met heel veel glijbanen te gaan aquaplus maar we wilden eerst weten of je daar met een shirt aan in mocht peggy heeft voor ons zitten bellen en bleek dat dit werd afgeraden en eigenlijk ook niet mocht voor de chickies zussies zou dit een probleem worden omdat ze allebei nogal snel verbranden dus stelde peggy ons voor om naar agios nicholaos te gaan en daar de boot naar spina longa te nemen zondag hebben we dus grotendeels doorgebracht in de bus en op een boot we gingen met de bus naar agios nicholoas om daar te kijken of een boot konden vinden naar spina longa spina longa is een eiland waar vroeger mensen naar werden verbannen als ze lepra hadden het eiland heeft een omtrek van ong 850 meter en is dus niet zo groot maar het was zeker de moeite waard om er heen te gaan toevallig liepen we langs een kantoortje waar tripjes naar dit eiland geregeld konden worden en we hadden mazzel want er vertrok ongeveer een uur later een boot naar spina longa voor 10 euro hebben we een mooie boottocht gehad en ook nog het eiland bekeken onder begeleiding van een gids was denk ik een van de mooiste dagen van ons verblijf op kreta de boottocht was ook heerlijk op het dek zitten in de schaduw en met de wind erbij was het prima te doen maandag was onze laatste dag dus s ochtends koffers verder inpakken en daarna nog souveniers shoppen veel winkeltjes van binnen gezien en een aantal dingetjes gekocht ook een shirt voor de baby van michalos en roula een roze shirt met in witte letters chickie erop ze waren er erg blij mee roula moest er zelfs van huilen de rest van de middag daar gezeten nog wat fris gedronken en een laatste maaltijd gegeten voor we onze bus moesten halen naar het vliegveld
1586119 natalie you need this book you need to practice drawing more if youre ever going to write that comic book you have to buy this
1586120 we are planning to do a series of webisodes literally a full season of them were planning to do one for every episode produced whether we pull that off remains to be seen
1586121 we want to do stories around dollhouse that we cant get in to the main narrative
1586122 you wake up every day and you feel like everyone wants you to be a different person and youre trying to like figure it out its like this identity crisis
1586123 joss really gets women theres a woman somewhere deep inside of him and so thats sort of what we just started talking about the challenge of that and what we face what i face in our culture today
1586124 these are different people they didnt do to me what was done to firefly
1586125 the only reason joss wasnt on my list is because i thought there was no way he was coming back
1586126 its a completely different energy then the last time fox understands what it is were trying to do i feel really good about how they plan to position it and their feeling about it as a concept and as a show
1586127 the thing with joss you launch his show and instantly it becomes somebodys favorite show to me in this current television environment if you can be somebodys favorite show youd better be patient with that show
1586128 i didnt want to do the standard come before me and my desk thing
1586129 i found it interesting that she would be the kind of person who wanted to look at the world rather than into her own space also it means that if you enter the room she doesnt
1586130 the main set a soaring two story structure with a catwalk around the edges and a high tech office suspended almost over a pond structure in the middle of the room was a stunner
1586131 ive got the same crew i had on angel and this shares some of the noir elements that angel had theres a dark suspsnese element to it at the same time we want to use la and im pleased to say she can go out during the day unlike the guy on angel i want it to have a very sort of lovely glamorous kind of exciting lush feel to it
1586132 yeah i think inevitably there will be lesbian bisexual story lines you know the premise of the show is these people are hired out for very specific engagements and some of those engagements are to be the person in your life that you dont get to have in your life and i think its inevitable that some of those stories are gonna involve people exploring their sexuality
1586133 at some point and not just eliza female and male members of the cast will have engagements where we explore that sexuality isnt the only focus of the show but its a part of it
1586134 there will be something within the order we have for sure the first 13 its not something anybody has asked us to shy away from its not something that has made the network twitchy at all they get it
1586135 the clan aint the way it should be right now but we thank yall for all of your support believe that

1586140 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1586141 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1586142 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved

1586145 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1586146 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1586147 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1586148 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1586149 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1586150 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1586151 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1586152 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1586153 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1586154 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1586155 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers

1586164 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1586165 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1586166 edouard is not going to have that large of an affect on tourism because its not expected to cause severe damage
1586167 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1586168 north texas home prices fall over previous year but up a bit from april
1586169 stigmatizing those who believe in intelligent design does not get us any closer to a respectful discourse

1586197 often you need someone a professional to really sit there with you and explain to you what the test results mean
1586198 lets say an adverse result was obtained then you do need help from a range of professionals
1586199 if you take breast cancer predictive test for example that is more complicated because in some cases it might be 40 accurate or in other cases depending on the population it may be 60 accurate
1586200 if you get a positive result that might mean you need to have much more intensive monitoring some women think about having a bilateral mastectomy
1586201 and if you get a negative result it doesnt mean you are not going to develop breast cancer it means you have got the same risk as the person on the other side of the road
1586202 many of these tests involve serious medical issues that require adequate counseling and support sometimes counseling requires one or two visits sometimes it requires family members to come in and get involved
1586203 we are very concerned that genetic testing is done appropriately so that peoples privacy and confidentiality can be respected

1586236 our expectation for him is to get into double digits this year
1586237 theres no question he improved his strength drastically from when he came here a year ago to where he is now thats going to help his power rush which he really didnt have last year i think hes doing a real good job of developing the power rush now
1586238 i didnt really know what to expect i had a lot of pressure on me i was just trying to figure everything out

1586243 i see a guy who not only can rush the passer and has the speed to get to the corner but hes also becoming a much more complete player

1586370 as everyone who has been to a meeting knows they are very paper intensive events
1586371 each piece of paper used in a meeting has the equivalent carbon emissions of burning a 60w light bulb for 1 hour as such a meeting of 10 people will typically have emissions of around 1 6kg of co2 equivalent to driving a typical 4x4 for 6 miles
1586372 the meetingpod is a paperless electronic meeting system which is much more energy efficient than using paper and uses a fraction of the energy used by laptops it holds all the meeting information that each attendee can view on their separate meetingpod this means that they do not have to print agendas minutes from the last meeting or any other information relevant to that meeting even separate presentations can be viewed on the built in screen making meeting room tables more efficient and easier to layout and use
1586373 venues are starting to look at their corporate social responsibility policies very closely
1586374 by not having a strategy to reduce their carbon footprint many meeting and conference venues are telling us that they are starting to lose business
1586375 the opportunity to present the results of the deep study at the isshps world congress reflects the considerable scientific and medical interest in this important study in pre eclampsia as this is the first time a drug has shown a clinical benefit towards improving an end organ function in pre eclamptic patients this study will advance efforts to identify the underlying cause s of this life threatening condition
1586376 we are delighted that the deep study results will be one of the leading presentations at this prestigious meeting discussions with key stakeholders about how to progress this important programme continue and we are encouraged by the interest shown in the programme to date we expect to give a further update on next steps towards the end of the year

1586383 kita tak tahu hal itu alasan alasan secara detil kenapa beliau mengundurkan diri alasan alasan yang relevan mestinya disampaikan di kongres nanti pernyataan yang beredar itu di luar keputusan atau komitmen bersama dalam keputusan ahwa tanggal 13 juli

1586391 tapi sampai sekarang ia masih menyukainya dan masih posesif ia tak suka ada pria lain yang memasuki kehidupan murni jadi apapun akan dilakukan agar murni tetap murni miliknya walau kuyakin murni sendiri tak lagi menyimpan hati padanya
1586392 rivan tak menyukai anak rohis seperti kamu karena gara gara masuk rohis murni tak mau melanjutkan hubungan dengannya murni jadi tahu tak ada yang namanya pacaran dalam islam sedangkan dia pikir toh kita kan orang muda yang harusnya senang senang tak usah mikirin urusan agama dulu jadi sah sah saja pacaran dan sepertinya ia takut kalau ada ikhwan rohis yang merebut hati murni
1586393 jadi adek adekku yang dicintai allah sekarang kita tahu kan bahwa cinta yang ditujukan untuk allah itu begitu mulia

1586476 why would you not want those outsiders to pay for the jail
1586477 the bottom line is that voters in johnson county have confidence in county government they knew that the expanded jail new juvenile services complex and expanded crime lab were needed

1586480 our feeling was if we got the message out people would support it
1586481 ive worked on campaigns but have never been the candidate its a whole different ballgame for me

1586483 i dont think people are going to know what hit them
1586484 with missouri being the show me state i think were about to be shown
1586485 political and economic indicators suggest that this years election is setting up to be one of the most defining elections in decades perhaps resembling elections of 1980 more than 1992
1586486 what were seeing statewide and nationally is a very angry electorate its very angry at incumbents and the status quo in a way we havent seen since the watergate years
1586487 what are they going to say that they dont like tort reform or the quality jobs initiative
1586488 or that they oppose the aggressive ways to try to grow the economy

1586496 in this community see me in a single dimension so there was a hurdle to overcome and we just couldnt get over it
1586497 they want an office led by a veteran prosecutor not a politician with a personal agenda and my 27 years of successfully prosecuting dangerous criminals makes me the most qualified candidate for the job
1586498 the democratic party has tonight nominated a 10 year prosecutor and law enforcement official

1586533 when an extravert sees you reading writing or maybe just thinking they might assume that the only reason youd do this is because you dont have someone to talk to so they think theyre doing you a favor by striking up a conversation when theyre actually interrupting
1586534 a simple way to look at extro introvert situation is that one type feels the need to push information out and the other just takes it in
1586535 why arent you drinking come on drink why wouldnt you want to drink just catch a taxi and get your car tomorrow come on
1586536 on the other hand extraverts and yes that is the correct spelling as used in the mbti get their
1586537 when an extravert sees you reading writing or maybe just thinking they might assume that the only reason youd do this is because you dont have someone to talk to so they think theyre doing you a favor by striking up a conversation when theyre actually interrupting
1586538 no matter how fabulous a person you are keep in mind that introverts simply prefer their internal world to the external world they might start off with a fully charged battery but while theyre engaged in conversation that battery is steadily draining
1586539 a lot of our people are under huge stress some of them dont talk about it but the fact is that they have been in these dry spells now for long periods of time
1586540 the board will keep an open mind of course for an offer of the whole company that reflects fair value
1586541 to gain a recommendation from the board and the right to conduct due diligence any proposal must recognize the value of our unique set of assets and must contain a sufficient control premium and this proposal did not reach the mark
1586542 everodd batch is for warehouse a and every even lot is for warehouse b

1586546 its been a while since i got a win so it feels amazing
1586547 im real happy with the way that it went and i got to fight in new mexico with all the support as well
1586548 we came out threw some punches then we scrambled and i took him down basically i went into half guard and threw some punches mounted him and the guillotine was right there and that was it
1586549 this last year ive been committed to being a full time mma fighter
1586550 im just working on my stand up and my overall mma game
1586551 i was hoping to show some of that but i didnt get to throw a lot of punches but a wins a win and im happy to get back in the win column im going to go from there and get back on track
1586552 theyre talking about having an elitexc on showtime in september in new mexico and thats an option
1586553 theres a couple other options that im looking at so im going to look to see whats best and go from there
1586554 i want to string some wins together and get back in there with the best get back on the big stage and make it happen
1586555 i want to thank my trainers justin fortune in boxing walter mccloskey in muay thai gracie barra jiu jitsu and the brazilian jiu jitsu academy in new mexico for all the awesome years
1586556 so how do you think you would do in one of those interviews
1586557 por anos o governo chin s tem tentado utilizar a olimp ada para legitimar a ocupa o ilegal do tibete
1586558 jornalistas s o proibidos na rea controlada pela pol cia de fronteira mas os dois desobedeceram a ordem
1586559 writing of the past is a resurrection the past then lives in your words and you are free
1586560 i was fascinated by how she entered the story as a fully formed spiritually oriented leader and wondered how she started her journey
1586561 sissy the protagonist of the novel grew out of my own spiritual quest her story evolved from there
1586562 it is ruled by a tightly controlled caste system everyone knows their destiny and their place in society as dictated by one of seven genetically engineered caste marks
1586563 as the caste system and society on harmony begin to break down from within as well as from invasion from the c s s and their enemies the maril sissy rises above her worker caste beginnings to become high priestess she must either bind her world back together through her prophetic visions or tear it apart in outrage at the implied slavery of the caste system
1586564 but she bears all seven caste marks something unheard of
1586565 she hides her anomaly as best she can but she cant hide her prophetic visions nor her unique bond with the planet and their goddess harmony
1586566 writing it was an organic process that amazed me with every unexpected plot turn
1586567 the sequel presents its own unique challenges but the story is there inside the characters its up to me to excavate it many fellow writers and friends helped me with the research most of the answers were just a question away
1586568 i think what readers read the story for is because they want to watch and follow characters that they love and hate
1586569 they want to be with those characters and follow that story and know whats going to happen exactly what those characters do isnt as important
1586570 if the characters are great characters and you want to journey with them the story is secondary
1586571 every time i do a new book thats like saying a new book couldnt possibly work because the readers read the previous book and why would they read more stories about the characters its the characters that are important
1586572 but i think the vast majority of fans their greatest hope and desire is to see the hero and heroine they love brought to life on screen
1586573 when we did star wars episode iii revenge of the sith i lamented the fact that i had to jump over the clone wars
1586574 and i jumped over the clone wars because it had nothing to do with anakin skywalker you know i mean hes just another player we had a very narrow focus on talking about him personally and i said its too bad we couldnt do that because its like world war ii its a huge canvas there to be mined
1586575 using anime and manga and those kinds of ideas that ive always wanted to work in
1586576 that sort of got me going to say you know we could do a
1586577 in a universe that is not restricted and therefore not quite as dark
1586578 we can have a lot more fun with it we can enjoy it its just a little bit more lighthearted

1586595 we have had seven wholesale price decreases since july 15 unfortunately the last one was extremely small so it is slowing a bit
1586596 theres quite a few more cents decrease to come through in the next two to four weeks
1586597 the last two months have been pretty hot it looks like it might be sustainable now but you have to question how much the futures market is artificially inflating oil prices

1586604 dat is niet mijn mama dat is een vreemde die mij van mijn mama heeft weggehaald
1586605 de hulpdiensten vragen om steeds de praatpalen te gebruiken omdat zij dan weten vanwaar de oproep komt
1586606 iemand is in paniek belt de 100 101 of 112 en zegt ik ben op de autosnelweg in halle maar is het halle bij brussel of halle in zoersel ook plaatsnamen als rekkem of rekem zorgen voor verwarring
1586607 het is niet omdat het aantal oproepen daalt dat het belang van de praatpaal afneemt
1586608 bij grote incidenten blijken gsm netwerken vaak overbelast voorts zijn praatpalen herkenbaar en eenvoudig in gebruik
1586609 het moet allemaal vrij snel gaan alles moet afgestemd zijn op de cameras het acteerwerk moet goed zitten n de aflevering moet tegen een bepaald tijdstip ingeblikt zijn
1586610 ik had veerle aanvankelijk niet in gedachten voor onze workshop sara die gaat toch niet komen dacht ik maar ze had wel degelijk tijd en ze was enthousiast
1586611 vanaf 2015 zal het verboden zijn chemische producten te gebruiken voor onkruidbestrijding om ervoor te zorgen dat we die europese norm halen zijn we nu al het gebruik van chemicali n aan het afbouwen
1586612 er wordt meer geveegd we gebruiken staalborstels en het onkruid wordt ook met de hand uitgetrokken maar het groeit zo snel dat het amper is bij te houden
1586613 de man botste met zijn hoofd tegen een tram van lijn 5
1586614 het slachtoffer moest lichtgewond naar het ziekenhuis de tramchauffeur klaagde over rugpijn
1586615 mochten we ooit verhuizen zou het alleen vanwege de fel toegenomen verkeersdrukte zijn maar dat is nog lang niet aan de orde
1586616 ik kom nog onder de mensen en durf nog een pint gaan drinken in olen boze reacties heb ik ook nog niet gekregen
1586617 tot vorige week werkte ik hier nog tien uur per dag en nu ineens niets meer dat steekt misschien begin ik elders nog wel met een handelszaak
1586618 ik hoop dat de curatoren mij hier nog laten uitverkopen mijn zoon rudi wil een bod doen op de inboedel mocht hij erin slagen de stock te verwerven dan zou zon uitverkoop nog flink wat kunnen opleveren
1586619 ja maar ik draaide hier nog goed hoor bijna 300 000 euro omzet per maand dat is toch niet slecht tijdens een uitverkoop waar alles aan min dertig en min vijftig procent staat de cafetaria trok nog altijd volk en we waren aan een goed mosselseizoen bezig
1586620 het aangekondigde shopping center dat investeringsmaatschappij intervest hier aan lammerdies zou bouwen sleept veel te lang aan het bedrijventerrein ligt er nu als een puinhoop bij aanlokkelijk is anders en ik geef toe ik heb ook wel te veel ge nvesteerd
1586621 hoezo gesloten ik kom hier mijn gordijnen ophalen ik heb een voorschot betaald dat is toch niet eerlijk
1586622 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1586623 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1586624 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1586625 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
1586626 shutting down the strait closing down the persian gulf would be sort of a self defeating exercise
1586627 that doesnt say anything about whether we tolerate such a thing to happen
1586628 and given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1586629 we dont believe that now is the time for any parties to be acting in a provocative way
1586630 we believe that the violence should stop and all parties should begin a discussion so that they can move forward towards settling the situation
1586631 if events develop in the worst possible way with the use of force russia will not be able to stand by seeing as russian citizens live in south ossetia
1586632 the days of building giant houses on former soybean fields on the outer fringes of metropolitan areas are over
1586633 tell em to come back and get to work when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation
1586634 i think its such a politically charged topic what do you do with these exotic animals
1586635 theres never been any problem with them mistreating the animals or problems with the enclosures
1586636 if theres going to be more regulations put someone on the job who knows what theyre doing
1586637 allowing it to enter the enjoining enclosure and kill an adult female tiger
1586638 did you just let in this muthafucka you dont know
1586639 i thank voters once again for electing me as the democratic nominee to the state senate in district 14 with a wide margin 62 to 38 i am confident their vote for change in the june primary will not be undermined by the unfortunate lawsuit filed friday my team and i ran a strong ethical issue based grassroots campaign that spoke to real concerns along with over 100 volunteers i knocked on over a thousand doors and spoke to hundreds of voters i raised almost 90 thousand from nearly 500 contributors many of whom gave 50 or less all of which was timely and thoroughly disclosed i was endorsed by numerous community organizations including new mexico professional firefighters association albuquerque area firefighters local 244 national education association new mexico american federation of teachers albuquerque teachers federation sierra club conservation voters new mexico south valley regional association of acequias democracy for new mexico and hispano round table the voters and their desire for change determined the outcome of the election i am confident the court will not overturn the will of the majority of the voters i look forward to representing district 14 in santa fe as state senator
1586640 the substance of this case is baseless we are prepared to let the legal system take its course we expect the case will be dismissed and the will of voters decision will be upheld
1586641 our campaign followed the rules and spirit of campaign finance
1586642 i received the support of respected leaders like senator jerry ortiz y pino city councilor rey garduno former congressional candidate and state senator richard romero and longstanding pillars of the community like the albuquerque teachers union albuquerque fire fighters union albuquerque journal and the sierra club
1586643 each night my volunteers family and i were on the doors talking to voters about the policy issues affecting our district im proud of the grassroots campaign i ran and honored to have received the support of elected and neighborhood leaders donors and most importantly an overwhelming number of voters in my district i look forward to representing the people of senate district 17 in santa fe
1586644 there are so many completely outlandish allegations that we dont even know where to begin everything in the lawsuit is categorically untrue
1586645 were going to do real well all you have to do is follow the money
1586646 like playing cards when the other side has a marked deck eric griego says he knocked on 1 000 doors good for him then why did he have to cheat
1586647 but he made the mistake on a breaking ball especially when you face a guy like webb you cant really afford that you hate to base a game on two hitters but thats what it came down to
1586648 i know zach was trying to bury it but he didnt quite get it down far enough
1586649 it wasnt a bad pitch it just wasnt the right pitch it was down enough i just threw it into where he was looking against brandon webb thats all it takes
1586650 you know the sinkers coming but its all about location and movement
1586651 he works in and out hes comfortable with both and has good offspeed stuff when a pitchers like that its not easy
1586652 i just wanted to stay down in the zone which is what id been doing all night
1586653 i think ive done some consistent work trying to tweak things
1586654 yeah id say this was an indication that things are going in the right direction
1586655 if we complied with a demand to grossly exceed the well established market for drafted players we would severely harm the pirates ability to build the championship caliber club our fans so richly deserve
1586656 if we move the market from a range of 4 million 6 million to more than twice that for a high draft choice the pirates would need to pay that new market price next year then year after year
1586657 one thing that fans should understand about the draft is that weve only asked for 11 players in my 36 years of doing this to get bonuses that have exceeded 4 million or 5 million all 11 of those players are highly successful
1586658 and weve only asked for bonuses that exceed 7 million or 8 million a couple of times and those players are mark teixeira j d drew stephen drew and people of that nature who are all either stars or coming stars i think its important to have that context of the work weve done in the past
1586659 the draft properly executed is a major source of talent acquisition for a club like ours and the ripple effect of such an irresponsible action would escalate significantly our cost not only this year but also 2009 and beyond
1586660 complying with a demand to pay whatever it takes to sign pedro alvarez would impair the clubs ability to execute that plan

1586673 its like history on crack or meth more likely thanks guys
1586674 when were sitting there coaching during the games it is hard to tell how good or bad it is sometimes but certainly i felt that some of the play was excellent tonight and im sure it must have been exciting to watch if we can get a game like that in mls cup final between the two teams then i would vote for that as well
1586675 i cant say im surprised both team mirror each other as far as that is concerned great professionals all they want to do is win the game and theyll do everything to win the game and do it in the correct manner when it ended you saw the respect between the two teams they had the class to congratulate each and every one of us and that is the way it should be
1586676 first half we played some great stuff i think that is as good as weve played all season the worrying thing is when you dont capitalize on it it generally can come back and bite you in the backside they certainly finished stronger than we did but i think all that had to do with was the effort we put in as far as playing they defended well and so when youre defending well and a teams putting a lot of energy in coming into the game it kind of tells we obviously gave them two terrible goals which you cannot do to a team like this weve gotten away with it tonight we certainly have to get rid of that but we won the game obviously a team like houston is always going to be there and if you give them a chance theyve got players like brian ching and dwayne de rosario that are a handful de rosario coming late is a real problem for any team but we managed to get our shots in tonight the penalties were just the usual gut wrenching but again we went behind weve got behind three times tonight and we managed to drag ourselves back up and eventually win the tie
1586677 it is huge we shouldnt be surprised our boys pride themselves on their commitment and passion to the game and each other and that was really what got it through they backed each other up tonight and run the extra mile for each other and that what got us the result at the end of the day i cant say enough about the quality and the character of the players
1586678 we do not get extra money for extra time but that was a great game tonight both teams fought really hard and i thought it was a fair fight so to speak and i think both teams played with class and with heart penalties can always go either way and we were the lucky team tonight
1586679 yeah that first goal was a mistake but amaechi igwe will tell you that he didnt hear us calling him off so he though he had to clear the ball that stuffs going to happen hes a young guy bounced back from a well and played great but they have like four guys over seven feet up there so theyre tough to deal with especially on the turf the balls bouncing around it was a big test for us tonight and in the 71st minute theyre able to bring a guy thats gosh kei kamaras like 8 foot 3 and can run like a deer it was difficult but we handled it well
1586680 you can try to play it pretty cool but i knew the weight of it im the new guy to the revolution so i wanted to make sure i hit the back of the net
1586681 tonight can see that both teams played their hearts out and played as hard as we possibly could penalties can always go either way type of situation and we were the lucky ones
1586682 you know theyre holding the mls cup right now so in my mind theyre the best team in the league until someone wins it this year weve obviously played very well but i know theres a long history between the two teams and i think to beat these guys in a final is big for us im probably the wrong guy to ask because i havent been around so i dont want to speak for the guys who were here for the last couple but were certainly excited that we won a big game
1586683 i think the whole game was intense the pace was unbelievable ive been watching mls for 10 years and i think that was one of the best games i have ever seen being in the back i can say i watched it because i wasnt in the thick of it but the pace was good and houston is a great team and they kept coming at us it took eight penalty shots to finally settle it so i think that says a lot about both teams
1586684 i think we had our eye on the prize so to speak i think that we have been down before and weve been up in finals and i think this is the first year that we decided that we really wanted to win it above all we were at home in front of our own fans the fans were unbelievable tonight so i think that was the extra push that we needed to get us over the top and to get those goals back
1586685 theyre a great team it didnt matter who we played we wanted to win the game but as far as the dynamo goes theyre great champions to beat them just says a lot regardless of the last two years in how we faired in the finals i think that their just a great team and for us to go out their and to show the resiliency that we did to continue on when we were down says a lot about this team
1586686 there are lots of factors that go into it mexican teams are in the beginning of their season they have played every game in the united states the teams in our group flew basically cross country in two days and played a game they went from playing us here to playing chivas usa across the country i mean its not easy i think thats why mls is a tough league they sort of saw that in this tournament but as far as the mls showing what theyve got against mexican teams we still have a ways to go but this was definitely a great showing
1586687 i mean how good was that game it was a good game it was great it was awesome for the fans it was awesome for the neutral fans it was awesome for the guys on the field although the houston players lost if you asked them on what they thought of the game they are going to say they had a lot of fun and it was probably up and down until the last point when they missed the penalty shot thats the way it works out nobody wants to shoot penalties at the end of the game especially one that was so closely contested but like i said theyre champions and were trying to show that we are too and i guess that this is just a starting point for us
1586688 we know them and they know us there is no bad blood the only bad blood revolves around the ball itself were not going at each others necks were going out to perform and thats what it comes down to and we respect them a lot and they us and it showed tonight there were no bad fouls the referee had control of the game and we just went out and played hard and they did too
1586689 not the result we wanted i thought we played well the first half had a good number of chances and gave them fits with brian ching and nate jaqua obviously we scored off a mistake and then made a mistake at the end of the half to let them back into the game we were feeling a little better when we were 1 0 than we are 1 1 two mistakes on the two goals in the first half if you make a mistake close to the half its the one you really want to take back i thought we did well came out in the second half and kept our attacking flowing it was a good wide open game you saw two teams that the field was fairly stretched there was good attacking play on both sides both keepers were pretty good tonight and then kei kamara sneaks up with a good goal in overtime then they reply right away its bad to give up a goal off a set piece but shalrie joseph has been dangerous on set pieces in this tournament with goals against chivas usa atlante and then tonight then it goes to penalties and i think it is just one of those who has the luck and who guesses the right way and who hits on the frame tonight was their night it went eight so it just shows you that whenever these two teams meet in big games there is definitely not a lot between the two i dont think we disappointed anybody with the performance tonight either team and i thought the teams showed their unity together before and after the game
1586690 when you score a goal it does open things up we got the early goal sometimes when that happens especially in a final it can open things up i could put our openness in the first half maybe down to a little bit of fatigue we had a tough game on saturday but then the goals do open it up obviously the second half was a little tighter and then you have a couple goals in overtime you never know sometimes these finals give you lots of goals and sometimes they dont the finals we have played before there have not been a lot in there even as far as scoring opportunities there were more scoring opportunities tonight and more chances tonight it just showed the determination to attack by both teams
1586691 when you look at the first couple games in both groups i thought the chance of an all mls superliga final was pretty good teams were playing well teams were up for it and i think we were getting the upper hand at times obviously the favorites to get to the final from the mexican side were pachuca and chivas guadalajara pachuca almost did and chivas got knocked out in the group stage i felt that if any teams were going to go to the final it would be the teams that were playing tonight both teams were in good form very consistent and were going deep into their bench and different players were getting opportunities to provide good performances as well it helps to have the games as home but you still have to beat the teams that are in front of you i wasnt surprised i thought maybe a mexican team might get in there i didnt think two would and im very happy that two mls teams were the last two teams standing
1586692 i was thinking that as the game was over that i hope we play them one more time this year and that would be mls cup final our ambition is to get there i know it is there ambition to get there it would obviously be a nice storyline for everybody they are a good team some great additions sainey nyassi kheli dube and kenny mansally have been good players for them this year it was nice to see our two new guys scoring with nate jaqua well nate is really not new just revisited us again and kei kamara scoring goals you look at teams that have been consistent over the years you know we got off to a bit of a rocky start this year but were finding good form as long as you get into the playoffs you give yourself a chance hopefully we make that march to playoffs and i think new england is in a pretty good position as well
1586693 i was able to capitalize on a mistake by them amaechi igwe was blocking matt reis so i just hit it first time and i was able to sneak it in i felt like we had some good chances we had some corners where the ball was bouncing around but we just werent able to get it in there the revolution are a good team and if you let them hang around theyre going to score goals obviously in a pk shootout its anyones game
1586694 after the ball was switched to the other side i knew brian ching was going to take his time and look for something after he made that cut thats when i decided to make that run because i knew he was going to serve it i knew matt reis was going to come out but i had to still make my run in between them and go up for the header it was a good cross and i was just happy to put it in the back of the net
1586695 the revolution worked really hard we worked really hard thats the game of soccer when you go to penalty kicks its just the lucky team that wins there they came out lucky today at the end of the game their pks went in the back of the net and ours didnt thats just how it is

1586719 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1586720 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1586721 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1586722 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1586723 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1586724 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1586725 in recent days thai troops moved to the temple and banned our troops from entering there

1586736 sweltering motorists doe not seem to a have a history as a reality a traffic jam is impressive but doesnt say much
1586737 let me ask you a question you think about traffic because i do constantly traffic is caused by the single car driver single people get in their cars every morning they drive and wonder why theres gridlock
1586738 you hit the brakes for a second just tap them on the freeway you can literally track the ripple effect of that action across a two hundred mile stretch of road because traffic has a memory its amazing its like a living organism
1586739 this guy goes around danging people lets speak up and try to make him stop hes getting way too far

1586741 ill have an opportunity to again outline the governments electricity reforms the protections in place
1586742 i will make the point it was not the government that called off the discussions and since then ive continued to make the point that the door is open again for further discussions
1586743 execution is one problem and the decision of the constitutional court is another
1586744 during the by election it is important for all parties to follow the orders given by the security authorities and ensure peace and stability
1586745 i think the reason they are having it on a weekday is to reduce the turnout
1586746 this is a deliberate action to inconvenience the voters we condemn the election commission for their decision
1586747 we fear there could be rigging we urge our supporters not to be complacent it is going to be a tough battle but we are confident of victory

1586756 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
1586757 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
1586758 ought to welcome people being able to express their minds and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely it is a mistake
1586759 but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history
1586760 im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation and its ballistic missile programmes
1586761 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1586762 they have got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1586763 you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world

1586767 he shook his head in response to questions from the judge some shakes of his appeared to be in the affirmative some of them appeared to be in the negative
1586768 then we can look to consider whether in the psychiatrists opinion the accused is fit to stand trial and whether we are proceeding at that point or whether there are fitness concerns that need to be canvassed by the court

1586773 hes a goalsneak and another great forward to fit in with ebo brett ebert and mots daniel motlop
1586774 i think the club would look at it sit down with him and see if hed fit in with our culture and things like that
1586775 yeah it probably plays on their mind a little bit and it probably puts a bit of motivation in their head for them to go out and play some good footy

1586792 they are primarily for the industry as a whole rather than the success or otherwise of tourism australias marketing activities
1586793 evaluating the impact of its projects would place tourism australia in a better position to measure its own effectiveness and impact
1586794 did not include an assessment of whether the objectives of the contract had been achieved or the various projects undertaken within the contracts were effective
1586795 this was a result of human error and thats why we have systems in place

1586797 we deeply regret the development in this case and would like to apologise to all concerned
1586798 things have to get worse for the aussie to continue selling off
1586799 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1586800 it would take very strong fundamental support for the australian dollar to regain recent highs and those fundamental supports are pulling back more quickly than we had anticipated

1586825 wellington already has many sustainable tourism stories with several businesses making real progress in this area

1586873 liberals are loathsome and deserve to be despised with the left ascendant everywhere this year venom should be delivered in stainless steel drums by the truckload most of the cutting edge issues that divide us are incapable of a negotiated resolution
1586874 we have been nursing a viper in our national bosom seven years after september 11 2001 this is the moment of truth when the left must finally decide what side its on jeremiah wright may mean the historical end of the civil rights era because fifty years after dr martin luther king jr the lefts presumption of victimhood and innocence is now gone the rev is only the visible bulge of this lethal political tumor this is saul alinskys sociopathic teachings on display and this is what hillary clinton learned back at wellesley college it is the voice of feminists who hate all men and of radicalized blacks who hate all whites for jeremiah wright the enemy comes with a white skin he has taken historical injustices and turned them into a lifelong call for vengeance this is the official doctrine of black liberation theology and it is freely supported by powerful institutions on the religious left blts founder dr jim cone is a professor of systematic theology at the union theological seminary its utterly bizarre but true so its not just senator obama who is stuck with mr wright today we are all stuck with a rageful left which really wants to destroy rather than to build so the entire american body politic has a festering sore on its hands this will not go away by itself it will not be bought off by more money it must be repudiated by the sensible left if it is still there

1586878 what i believe geraldine ferraro meant is that if you take a freshman senator from illinois called jerry smith and he says im going to run for president would he start off with 90 percent of the black vote

1586888 somehow many of us have the idea that god owes us his favor after all we are americans the defenders of democracy as we run the race of life let us ask ourselves if god owes us anything after examining the evidence we might have to conclude that what he owes us is his judgment today we will consider what god thinks of the us of a

1586892 for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse
1586893 i dont know if there is a god but if there is a god it is beyond our ability to know him man invents gods and religions to explain the ultimately unknowable
1586894 wow somebody awesome made those i wonder who that is and why he made them

1586901 consumerism is a worldview that sees the consumption of material goods and services as the main purpose of life
1586902 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
1586903 shedding of his own blood for the remission of our sins
1586904 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
1586905 the times of ignorance god overlooked but now he commands all people everywhere to repent because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead
1586906 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
1586907 the spirit of truth who shall guide you into all truth
1586908 now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his christ have come for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down who accuses them day and night before our god and they have conquered him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony for they loved not their lives even unto death
1586909 at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
1586910 a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices especially one who regards or treats the members of a group as a racial or ethnic group with hatred and intolerance
1586911 obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions
1586912 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal have been endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among these are the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
1586913 one persons tolerance for a false god is another persons intolerance against the true god
1586914 hey dont you know that buddha was just a man like you and hes dead now
1586915 hey the true and living god made those fruit flowers and herbs worship him
1586916 and what that meant was that the courts essentially were going to have no role in national security they had an important role in our system but not in protecting our nation from foreign threats i guess what my battle scars are about is trying to basically square that circle trying to use our criminal justice system as a means from protecting us from people who actually mean us an existential threat to our system
1586917 rush explain something to me if you would how is it that some people think that with the legal system the foundation of it is the presumption of innocence how can anybody think that will apply to armed militants under declared hostilities against the country not individuals how can anybody think that that would apply
1586918 thats the whole point and you know some people are of the opinion that there is a group of people in this country that would love to have the enemy win by hook or by crook close guantanamo bring those prisoners here make them subject to us constitutional rights when theyre not even citizens all for the purposes of embarrassing the country primarily due to a hatred of george w bush
1586919 well i was the lead prosecutor and that informant turned out to be the main witness in the case and he was my witness so i spent you know quite a bit of time studying what he had done and also you know having to do the other odds and ends that you do when you do a case like this one of which was to try to get prepared in the event the blind sheik decided to testify and that was an eye opener
1586920 in fact the whole experience in watching the dynamic of him and other people in the muslim community throughout the trial was a real eye opener for me i wanted to believe in 1993 the stuff that we were putting out you know that he basically perverted who was otherwise a peaceful doctrine but what i found was going through all of his thousands of pages of transcripts and statements was that when he cited scripture to justify acts of terrorism to the extent he was quoting scripture or referring to it he did it accurately which shouldnt be a surprise
1586921 so you went in thinking this guy might be a fringe little kooky and perverting islam and you were stunned to find out that everything he said or proclaimed had a root basis
1586922 mccarthy thats correct theres no other way of putting it and it shouldnt have been a surprise i mean he was a doctor of islamic jurisprudence graduated from al azhar university in egypt why in the world i would have thought that i or the justice department would know more about islam than he would is beyond me now that i look back on it but back then i was pretty confident that we must have been right when we said that he was basically perverting the doctrine
1586923 mccarthy the ideology that were talking about here is 14 centuries old it existed and thrived before there was a united states it has commanded the allegiance of the old and the young the rich and the poor the educated and uneducated to some extent sunnis and shiites princes and paupers you know you cant pigeonhole one rationale for why it exists other than the obvious one which is that its a matter of doctrine and the people who believe it believe its a divine injunction and that mankind doesnt have a right to make laws which run afoul of what they believe is the law that was handed down by allah directly to mohammed 14centuries ago
1586924 you mentioned these people in the fourteenth century one of the things i constantly try to tell people is that to demonstrate the true greatness of western democracies representative republics and a western civilization a culture we are all born as little savages if we were not raised by parents if we were not instructed in right and wrong morality and so forth we would turn out however we did these people remind me of just that theyre being raised to behave and think as they do im talking about the jihadists this culture thats 1400 years old human beings are not by instinct not by nature good that has to be programmed into them it has to be raised in them and these people of course have a different definition they think they are good theyre doing everything in the name of god and yet their crimes are against humanity
1586925 i wouldnt be competent to say youd have to ask someone like him about that
1586926 what it flagged for me was even though these people were very moderate and peaceful people youd never see them be terrorists
1586927 what they have going for them that we dont is they have basically eradicated our threshold idea of what is civilized behavior they are willing to do anything to win and theyre absolutely sure that history is on their side yes they pursue their attacks on us single minded while we continue to listen to the rev wrights who hate and besmirch our history while we are on the verge of electing a president who hates everything that this country ever stood for while half the american people slander our founding fathers as a bunch of greedy racist slavers while digging their ostrich heads into the sands rather than find out what the truth is if america goes down it will be because we are stupid on top of everything else sure than we are now that were right and that we have a need to show them that however long it takes were going to do what has to be done to win you know we cant rely on the fact that were a super power and that its inevitable that well win this thing
1586928 as everyone who has been to a meeting knows they are very paper intensive events
1586929 each piece of paper used in a meeting has the equivalent carbon emissions of burning a 60w light bulb for 1 hour as such a meeting of 10 people will typically have emissions of around 1 6kg of co2 equivalent to driving a typical 4x4 for 6 miles
1586930 the meetingpod is a paperless electronic meeting system which is much more energy efficient than using paper and uses a fraction of the energy used by laptops it holds all the meeting information that each attendee can view on their separate meetingpod this means that they do not have to print agendas minutes from the last meeting or any other information relevant to that meeting even separate presentations can be viewed on the built in screen making meeting room tables more efficient and easier to layout and use
1586931 venues are starting to look at their corporate social responsibility policies very closely
1586932 by not having a strategy to reduce their carbon footprint many meeting and conference venues are telling us that they are starting to lose business

1586935 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1586936 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
1586937 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
1586938 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
1586939 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1586940 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1586941 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates

1587090 the incidence of kidney disease is skyrocketing in the united states and is a tremendous burden on the health care system

1587116 the real onus is on the countries and the national federations to see that their athletes arrive clean
1587117 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1587118 i have no doubts that when i line up next week i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean
1587119 that is such a disgrace and ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar
1587120 we agree with tamsyn that its a problem but its a problem that the ioc is throwing enormous efforts at to solve
1587121 i think the best attitude for athletes here is to concentrate on their performances and leave the detection of cheats to the appropriate authorities
1587122 no but if i dont take this chance how else am i supposed to know
1587123 ive done nothing to deserve this im a hero to these people i will no longer let anger drown me i want to be normal again

1587135 in recent days thai troops moved to the temple and banned our troops from entering there
1587136 but we have already resolved the problem with each other it is okay now all cambodian and thai troops withdrew to their original bases

1587140 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
1587141 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
1587142 ought to welcome people being able to express their minds and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely it is a mistake
1587143 but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history
1587144 im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation and its ballistic missile programmes
1587145 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1587146 they have got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1587147 you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world

1587154 the children see him as a kind uncle coming to visit not in his official position
1587155 there are geniuses poets artists and physicians among the kids who call mercy their home and yet they are labeled as klong toey children and not the children who are worthy of proper education and jobs
1587156 the visit of mr uncle president is telling them they are of great value and not to believe any of the bad stuff people might say
1587157 now the situation has eased at the temple there is no more armed confrontation
1587158 we welcome it and the sooner the redeployment takes place the better

1587160 most scientific knowledge concerning human identity and human development prior to birth was based solely upon gross morphological observations and biochemical studies over the past twenty years there have been extraordinary scientific medical and technological advances and discoveries which expose the rather rudimentary level of knowledge and ignorance of science errors of fact and judgment concerning past scientific understanding of the childs existence as a human being the childs early development and ability to react to the childs environment and feel pain prior to birth the new techniques developed through the exploding revolution over the past twenty years permits scientists to observe human existence and development at a molecular level which is applicable in determining genetic uniqueness genetic diseases and related information through the analysis of human genes well in advance of the old gross anatomical observation

1587174 voor de duitsers hebben we zelfs een speciaal programma stunde der volksmusik waarin we alleen duitse muziek draaien
1587175 in 1982 is in maaseik een lokale radiozender opgericht door de toenmalige cvp maar die zender zond toen nog illegaal uit
1587176 een jaar later kreeg de zender een vergunning en ging ie onder de naam de vrije vogel in de ether de zender verhuisde toen ook van het industrieterrein van maaseik naar de weertersteenweg
1587177 zo kunnen we veel gemakkelijker beslissingen nemen en knopen doorhakken
1587178 het voordeel van een zendmast binnen is dat ie droog staat
1587179 zo is de kans dat de bliksem er op inslaat veel kleiner
1587180 voor de duitse luisteraars is er zelfs een speciaal programma stunde der volksmusik met alleen duitse muziek
1587181 daarnaast hebben we ook enkele nederlandse djs in ons presentatieteam willeke bijvoorbeeld die elke vrijdag een centrale gast ontvangt in haat show willeke op vrijdag
1587182 maar dat we veel nederlandse luisteraars hebben daar zijn we zeker van bijna alle mensen die ons opbellen tijdens de uitzendingen zijn nederlanders ze zijn dan ook iets mondiger dan wij belgen h lacht
1587183 en radio maken ontstrest mij omdat het mij een heel ander soort stress als op het werk geeft daarnaast is het maken van een programma a s goeie zondag ook heel verrassend ten eerste is het altijd een verassing of mijn gasten wel komen opdagen en ten tweede weet je nooit op voorhand wat ze gaan vertellen
1587184 ik verzamel al dertig jaar belgische nederlandse en duitse dialectmuziek
1587185 ik vermoed dat ik zon 1500 dialectplaten in mijn collectie heb
1587186 ik heb op de maastrichtse radiozender l1 al zeven jaar mijn eigen rubriekje in het programma plat eweg in dat rubriekje dat de oude doos heet vertel ik elke week over een oude opname uit mijn dialectcollectie
1587187 ze staat ermee op en gaat er mee naar bed
1587188 ik kan maar moeilijk naar zenders als q music of radio 2 luisteren daarom vind ik het leuk dat er een zender is die ik volledig naar mijn visie heb kunnen uitbouwen rekening houdend natuurlijk met wat de luisteraars willen
1587189 soms hoor ik een plaat in een bepaald programma die daar helemaal niet in thuishoort
1587190 ik noteer dat dan en als ik terug in de studio aankom gooi ik die plaat meteen uit de lijst
1587191 eigenlijk zijn we vroeger gewoon toevallig in die lokale radio gerold
1587192 eigenlijk hadden we daar toen ook helemaal geen kaas van gegeten zelf presenteren is dan ook nooit in ons opgekomen
1587193 als de tijd rijp is en ik vind een geschikt programma ga ik er mij misschien toch nog ooit aan wagen
1587194 tot in het parlement geweest om radio wellen te redden
1587195 ik denk veel na over de toekomst van onze radiozender
1587196 en zonder verjonging vrees ik dat die er niet al te rooskleurig zal uitzien
1587197 het is dezer dagen heel moeilijk om nog vrouwen te vinden om te presenteren op de radio
1587198 en zeker voor op een zondagvoormiddag dan staan alle vrouwen natuurlijk achter de kookpotten lacht
1587199 met de hulp van vrw heb ik enkele jaren geleden mijn twee honden teruggevonden
1587200 ze waren thuis ontsnapt omdat we de deur hadden laten openstaan maar na een oproepje op de radio zijn ze weer terechtgekomen
1587201 het idee voor radio vrw hebben we destijds gehaald bij radio sylvania
1587202 toen de lampenfabriek sylvania in 1979 op de fles ging richtten de vakbinden een radiozender op om hun protestboodschappen beter te kunnen verspreiden toen we merkten dat de overheid niet ingreep tegen die illegale radio sylvania zijn we er zelf een begonnen we zijn gestart met een zendertje van 5 watt een sterkere zender durfden we niet te gebruiken want als we het luchtruim zouden verstoren kregen we gegarandeerd de rtt op ons dak en konden we ons zaakje opdoeken
1587203 uitgerekend op een avond dat we een sinterklaas hadden uitgenodigd in onze studio stond plots de rtt met hun peilwagen voor de deur
1587204 terwijl de gasten in onze studio de mannen van de rtt tegenhielden evacueerden wij onze apparatuur langs de achterdeur het had niet veel gescheeld of we waren alles kwijt geweest
1587205 voorzitter raymond had hoogte gekregen van het nieuwe frequentieplan en belde mij op johnny het gaat gedaan zijn met ons als dat nieuwe plan er komt
1587206 toen keulen zag hoe wij hier werkten vond hij dat zo fantastisch dat hij ons uitnodigde om in het parlement persoonlijk een pleidooi te komen voeren over het voortbestaan van radio wellen
1587207 wij willen niks zelfs geen eurocent subsidies het enige dat wij vragen is een zendvergunning
1587208 de parlementsleden waren blijkbaar zo onder de indruk dat radio wellen nog altijd draaiende wordt gehouden door onbezoldigde hobbyisten dat we prompt als eerste limburgse radiozender een zendvergunning kregen
1587209 wij kampen met het probleem dat elke vereniging die draait op vrijwilligers dezer dagen kent
1587210 het wordt steeds moeilijker om jonge mensen te vinden die onbezoldigd radio willen maken en ook onze activiteiten om geld in het laatje te krijgen brengen steeds minder op dat is die dalende koopkracht h
1587211 wellen was een tijdje geleden nog een witte vlek voor de drie operatoren maar omdat de gemeente niet wilde dat naast onze oude zendmast er nog een nieuwe gsm mast zou bijkomen zijn we erin geslaagd om onze zenders op die nieuwe gsm mast te krijgen nu prijken onze vier zenders helemaal bovenaan die mast boven de gsm zenders en die van de politie en het heeft ons geen eurocent gekost
1587212 wij zien onszelf als h t programma dat belgisch rocktalent w l een kans geeft
1587213 onlangs kreeg ik bericht van een amerikaanse groep die via de website van vrw gehoord had van rock kaffee en hier wilde komen optreden om zo promotie te kunnen voeren ik heb hen toen maar duidelijk gemaakt dat ons zendbereik tamelijk beperkt is lacht
1587214 er heerste nogal wat rivaliteit tussen beide ploegen en het werd echt op de seconde afgemeten hoeveel tijd wij aan elke ploeg besteedden op de radio
1587215 als ik wat kritisch ben over een speler tijdens mijn verslag van een match van wellen krijg ik wel eens een lastige vader aan de lijn
1587216 vind ik niet erg dan weet ik immers dat er geluisterd wordt
1587217 ik heb wel eens van die dagen dat ik denk bart voor wie zit gij hier nog radio te maken want uiteindelijk weten we nooit hoeveel luisteraars we precies hebben dat wordt niet gemeten
1587218 een tijdje geleden hadden we helmut lotti vast gekregen voor een telefonisch interview
1587219 en net op dat moment dat we hem in de ether hadden kregen we een panne zeker helmut weg alsof de duivel ermee gemoeid was
1587220 ik werk 60 uur per week voor de radio als hobby
1587221 het is altijd mijn droom geweest om een eigen radiozender op te richten
1587222 per week ben ik zon zestig uur met fm goud bezig als hobby
1587223 in 2003 was er een nieuwe erkenningsronde voor lokale radios en dat was onze kans om ons eigen radiodossier in te dienen
1587224 probleem was dat bestaande lokale radios voorrang op ons zouden krijgen omdat zij al meer media ervaring hadden
1587225 een jaar heb ik aan dat dossier gewerkt en het sloeg aan we kregen onze vergunning
1587226 ja waarom dat kwam toen als eerste in ons op klinkt toch ook goed maar meer moet je er niet achter zoeken
1587227 een paar stoelen hier komen inderdaad uit hun winkel maar de rest hebben we bij de kringloopwinkel gehaald
1587228 drie maanden lang hebben we twaalf keer per dag hun naam moeten afroepen op onze radio zo gaat dat dan h lacht
1587229 ik heb eens aan een stemtest van de vrt meegedaan maar dat is op niks uitgedraaid
1587230 ik ben er zeker zon zestig uur per week mee bezig
1587231 als het kon zou hij er zestig uur per dag in steken
1587232 ik kan het niet live doen want overdag sta ik voor de klas
1587233 als zij horen dat er iets fout zit in de studio sturen ze mij een smsje en dan rijd ik er naartoe om orde op zaken te stellen
1587234 we zijn door rgr2 radio groot rotselaar naar plaats zes verdrongen
1587235 ik vind nog altijd dat we heel goed bezig zijn
1587236 we hebben nog altijd een dagelijks luisterbereik van 7 480 mensen en iedere maand zijn er ruim 54 000 noord limburgers die tenminste een keer naar onze zender luisteren dat is toch niet niks h en we zijn tenslotte altijd nog maar vier jaar bezig
1587237 zo hebben we eens een vrouw aan de lijn gehad die geen familie of vrienden meer had en toch graag nog eens een cadeautje zou willen krijgen op moederdag
1587238 we zijn er naartoe gereden maar toen we bij haar aanbelden barstte ze in tranen uit wel tien minuten heeft ze rond onze nek gehangen en dat allemaal live op de radio
1587239 we hebben ook een vaste luisteraar die elke week een gedicht opstuurt voor zijn vriendin die in gent in het ziekenhuis ligt
1587240 wij lezen dat gedicht dan elke week voor op de radio die man neemt die uitzending op een cassette op en speelt die af in het ziekenhuis tja als je mensen daar gelukkig mee kunt maken dan doen we dat toch gewoon
1587241 die boodschap hangt er om te vermijden dat onze luisteraars hier de deur platlopen
1587242 de mensen horen ons op de radio maar ze willen ons ook wel eens in het echt zien voor sommige mensen zijn we eigenlijk een beetje bereikbare idolen
1587243 tijdens mijn regentaatopleiding heb ik eens een eindwerk over faalangst gemaakt en toen heb ik de website faalangst
1587244 jij hebt gedacht dat wij hier allemaal faalangst hebben zeker
1587245 bij radio ham heb ik in 27 jaar al veel medewerkers zien komen en gaan maar het belangrijkste is dat we al die jaren kwaliteit zijn blijven leveren
1587246 de quiz is zo simpel als wat maar het werkt wel
1587247 sommige luisteraars hebben buiten mij geen enkel sociaal contact meer soms blijven ze maar praten en moet ik ze gewoon van de lijn afschudden
1587248 dat is cecile 88 lentes jong die flapt er wat uit
1587249 onlangs gokte ze de letter l de lvan lul zei ze daar hebben toen heel wat luisteraars kwaad op gereageerd
1587250 helemaal in het begin hebben we nog even uitgezonden vanuit de vroegere dancing marvichoeve die achter dit gebouwtje lag maar toen die failliet dreigde te gaan hebben we ons materiaal naar deze schuur gebracht anders zou het misschien in beslag genomen worden
1587251 die radionamen klinken grappig maar ze hadden ook hun nut hoor
1587252 het eerste anderhalf jaar zonden wij immers illegaal uit elke keer als de politie in de buurt was braken wij snel onze discobar en antenne af en reden we er mee weg
1587253 ik breng het verslag van die gemeenteraden altijd met een kwinkslag en met een kritische bijklank als het verslag op de radio is geweest krijg ik dikwijls kwade telefoontjes van gemeenteraadsleden of schepenen
1587254 als mensen onrecht wordt aangedaan moet dat aangeklaagd worden ook als mijn broer daar voor iets tussen zit
1587255 als will tura vroeger kwam optreden stond hij van s avonds acht tot twaalf op het podium nu krijgt iemand die twee woorden kan kwelen al een platencontract en vraagt die een flinke som geld om een half uurtje op te treden
1587256 we hebben hier in 27 jaar heel veel schoon volk ontvangen
1587257 louis neefs vader abraham willy sommers en het eerste interview dat dana winner ooit gegeven heeft was voor radio ham dat moet zon twintig jaar geleden zijn een dj van ons woonde bij haar in de buurt breng ze maar eens mee we zien wel wat het geeft had ik tegen hem gezegd ik weet nog dat ik een groot boeket bloemen voor haar had gekocht een schoon madameke is het een maand later heeft ze zelfs opgetreden op het bal van radio ham voor 5 000 frank
1587258 maar dat proberen we echt tot een minimum te beperken
1587259 in radio moet een ziel zitten gewoon plaatjes draaien kan iedereen
1587260 elke morgen tussen 9 en 10 uur is ere en kookprogramma
1587261 ik bel elke dag een hamse kookmoeder op en vraag haar wat ze die middag in haar kookpotten gaat klaarmaken
1587262 de diaken van ham neemt elke week de zaterdagavondmis op en dat bandje laten we hier op zondagmorgen afspelen zo kunnen de oudere mensen die niet goed meer te been zijn toch naar de mis luisteren
1587263 als de mensen zelf hun muziek mogen kiezen zijn het toch vooral nederlandstalige nummers die we moeten opleggen
1587264 jaren geleden draaide ik even voor middernacht eens een nummer met een leuk accordeondeuntje in even later belde een vrouw voor de titel van dat liedje maar omdat ik die niet meteen vond heb ik het maar de nachttango genoemd nu belt die vrouw bijna wekelijks om de nachttango nog eens te horen
1587265 elke keer als ik het liedje van the strangers opzette met de passage
1587266 those juggalo cats are some of the coolest cats i know i saw one had painted drug abuse on their forehead so you know them cats is real
1587267 the shit ive seen them cats coming around acting like juggalos when they aint is wrong im going to end the juggalo holocaust myself even if their aint anyone with me musical freedom needs to be expressed no mater what and nothing can stop us
1587268 there will be no effect on competition or on operations and we hope it will clear up very soon
1587269 i dont think we were as sharp as we have been i dont think we played very well or not up to what we can play
1587270 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
1587271 we are going to play much better defence i think you have to give some credit to the australian team because they executed very well
1587272 the depth is amazing so who knows what can happen when all those people come together and have a one off race
1587273 the world record is phenomenal australian kieren perkins swimming 14 41 previous record was something special and for grant to beat that by seven seconds is still unbelievable now
1587274 its probably one of the best records on the books and it can stand for a long long time but who knows
1587275 the 1500m is probably going to be the most difficult its ever been and in terms of the qualification is the only thing im thinking of at the moment
1587276 the heats are going to hard enough just to get to the final there are a lot of guys who are going to have to swim fast just to make the final
1587277 the final is going to be an absolute dog fight because there are so many guys who have swum well below 15 minutes this year and theres not really a clear favourite theres just a lot of guys bunched up to do a good battle
1587278 grant is a fantastic athlete and he wouldnt be around in the sport if he wasnt still hungry and wanting to still do it
1587279 going for his third olympic title is a great testament to him as an athlete and hes definitely going to be among the ones to beat again
1587280 righties couldnt get righties lefties couldnt get lefties we just couldnt throw strikes today you know our bullpen has been very good the second half of the season so far and we just had an off night
1587281 its just a bad time to have to go through something like this
1587282 if you cant pass that physical test that we give then somethings not right
1587283 so ive been kind of jabbing at them with that i wish i could take the test just to show everybody that i was in good shape its sort of a pride issue
1587284 he wasnt necessarily in condition to go through a training camp like this
1587285 he really wasnt theyll have to reevaluate their offseason program as young rookies
1587286 ive had this happen in other places ive coached and its very difficult
1587287 when you interview them its going to be easy theyre going to walk around and go this is nothing ill get this right away
1587288 but once they get out there and they really see what they have to do and how exact they have to be and the speed at which they have to play and the intensity then i think theyll see now can we get them in and work them in yes will they get up to speed yes but this is valuable time
1587289 as far as making an impact from the get go i dont look at that as a difficult thing to do
1587290 the two a day practices they were getting to him
1587291 it was tough coming into the training camp right away
1587292 it was an eye opener i definitely will be better prepared next year
1587293 when a new coaching staff comes in you never quite know how youre going to fit in the new offense
1587294 but ive always taken the same approach even with the same coaching staff and i just do the best i can to open his eyes and say

1587321 since guns were outlawed in britain i quickly realized that even if you take peoples guns away from them theyll still find a way to kill one another if they have evil in their hearts
1587322 guns have legitimate uses and hurt no one including the user when used lawfully while illegal drugs do not meet this same description
1587323 drug abuse and legal gun ownership are apples and oranges
1587324 oh yes part of the reason the american people have the protected right of gun ownership is to overthrow their own government if it becomes oppressive

1587408 its politics as usual joan resorted to a negative campaign attacking democrat jared polis
1587409 she sponsored a bill to increase oil company profits and joan fitz gerald is the only candidate to accept thousands from big oil special interest pacs
1587410 one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1587411 a cocky air of invincibility accompanied us up the long tau shipping channel because we hadnt been shot at yet and americans at war who havent been shot at are allowed to be cocky
1587412 obama is caught up in his own rock star image he needs to get back to what he started with in the primaries
1587413 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1587414 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1587415 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1587416 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1587417 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face

1587422 cory redding were going to hold him we just dont want to mess with it langston moore shoulder hes fine its a real one i mean he could probably go but were being smart
1587423 todays the day were going to find out he did some work today well find out where were at there
1587424 i think brian kelly should be ok its on us how much we want to do with him
1587425 no ernies not out its still day to day with him well wait and see healthwise hes doing fine
1587426 edwin mulitalo wont play left guard and then i wish i had my sheet with me and the pup so were probably down about 10 guys or so well probably go into this thing with about 60 70 guys
1587427 what happens too is a lot of these younger guys are going to play more theyre going to play the majority of the game we wont play the first group very long so they need the reps right now because its different looks its a different run game completely different run game for us which is good great fits for us and some things on defense they do a little bit differently so we made sure we got the looks in today
1587428 we have a few things left but right now in terms of the running game i think jim might have a couple things left to install but right now we have to go out and just see if we can get a few runs and see if we can execute just see where were at in terms of pad level and getting off the ball we should know who to block my grandson might be able to know who to block by now weve done this stuff every day a million times now weve just got to go out and execute it and tee off and do some of those things you dont want to do too much tomorrow i want to see us just execute and how physical we can be and see where were at with it
1587429 in a game this early i dont know i think just the commitment were trying to do running the football
1587430 well i dont know how much the first units going to play it will be limited
1587431 i think trying to get the right word a form of intelligence not book intelligence its the brightness at those positions where you dont make mistakes when you have players who are really on it which were trying to do the first rule to winning is dont beat yourself with penalties theres concentration or judgment self control and then a team thats smart will not turn the ball over and just third down defense not making mistakes if you blitz you have to do things exactly right when you see people being exactly right they know what to do then they start gaining a little bit of swagger to them and its about execution and i think once you feel that running game as we keep banging away at that thing if that thing starts to crank for us then i think that is a chance to really tee off and go if were running the ball were probably defending it well
1587432 i think one thing is that the talent pool is so close in the league because were all drawing from the same talent pool which means you cant make mistakes or you have to make fewer mistakes than others so talent is important but i dont think thats what separates you in this league because theres so much of it and its so equal and it shifts around in the league so quickly i think what it comes down to is getting a bunch of men working together some chemistry team chemistry a willingness to have a great special teams because thats a big part of our game and attitude i just think thats how the game has been designed to be played
1587433 the thing ive stressed to them a lot is defense especially and offense too is you at times have to give up an opportunity to make a play so a teammate can make a play thats hard to do in this league because guys are getting paid to make plays sometimes a guys got to squeeze a block he knows he can probably go in and make that play but if he fights in there and that thing breaks outside thats a big play he might go in there and make a big hit or make a big play we have defensive ends that we ask to drop in coverage on third down at times we zone blitz well hes getting paid to do what rush the passer and get sacks but now hes got to give up that opportunity to maybe go get a sack so that we might be able to beat a protection on a blitz thats just the way this game was designed to be played at one time as a team and doing whatever it takes to win the game
1587434 thats something we talk about the real team is non verbal acknowledgment in basketball its an assist its a pick its those types of things you have to keep selling that part of thats what winning is all about the good teams in this league can do that what breaks it down sometimes is the individual stats
1587435 i was just watching the tape again last night its just doing the things were supposed to do when were supposed to be doing them its just not beating ourselves theyre a great team and they did a nice job but we had penalties that hurt us bad in that game our own penalties but its something weve got to take care of we turned the ball over a couple times you just cant do that against a team like that theyre not going to turn the ball over theyre going to kick field goals and make their points and play tough defense and they run the ball well
1587436 yea dallas and those games too thats all part of it some real tough pressurized games we came up short in thats what weve got to stay after just that part of it were good enough if we play good team football and have good chemistry and eliminate mistakes thats going to keep us in the game then once it gets down toward the end a playmakers got to make a play toward the end of the game a playmaker has got to step up and weve got enough of those
1587437 its a great model for this league i dont know if they had all the talent of anybody in the league but they play good team football they play good defense they got up the field they ran the ball the quarterback when it counted the last seven or eight games didnt turn it over they had few penalties and they won and theyre very physical an extremely physical football team i thought that was just an awesome job of coaching football
1587438 they had two great players that they didnt have at tight end and running back from a year ago i think they had a fifth or sixth round pick at running back that came in and played great football for them i think every rookie made their squad and contributed in some form offense defense or special teams thats great thats great ball
1587439 no we know what we want theyre a great example of team football i think theyre really doing just a tremendous job with their team
1587440 hes going out every day and just keeps getting better i want him to go all out and hes got to keep going injuries just lay there like that i dont want to miss a beat in that area
1587441 its basically bull he has money and he has lawyers hes doing what he has to do to keep his job

1587511 la falta de una propuesta concreta del gobierno en el marco de un creciente deterioro salarial nos lleva a tomar esta actitud sabemos que el salario es uno de los principales instrumentos para la distribuci n de la riqueza por eso pedimos que el gobierno act e en consecuencia con su proyecto redistributivo

1587525 hay tantos entes que intervienen en esta tem tica que he explicado en la reuni n multisectorial convocada por la conasec para ver el problema de los accidentes en las carreteras que en espa a solo un sector es el responsable de la seguridad en las v as del pa s y este es el ministerio del interior
1587526 si ello ocurriese no habri duplicidad de funciones pues las inspecciones del plan tolerancia cero est n a cargo de personal del mtc mientras la polic a de carreteras solo est para darles seguridad y respaldar se cumplan sus decisiones
1587527 existiendo un convenio internacional con espa a se podr a gestionar que expertos de ese pa s sean invitados a fin de implementar ese modelo adecu ndolo a nuestra realidad
1587528 en el per son las comisar as del sector en donde ocurren los accidentes las que tienen a cargo la investigaci n de los mismos all se pierden evidencias pues los agentes de la polcarr levantan las evidencias y huellas las cuales muchas veces no son consideradas por la comisar a eso no favorece las estad sticas porque en el atestado no se precisan las causas reales porque las pruebas no son las primeras sino las secundarias
1587529 todo tema que judicialmente tenga como elemento central el respeto a la vida humana no puede ser secundario con relaci n a un pleito de federaciones deportivas

1587551 this was our worst effort i wouldnt say effort this is our worst performance
1587552 i dont think we were as sharp as we have been i dont think we played very well or not up to what we can play
1587553 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
1587554 we are going to play much better defense i think you have to give some credit to the australian team because they executed very well
1587555 we broke down on defense and let the other team get open looks
1587556 we cant have mental breakdowns like those because these teams are tough and really know how to shoot the ball
1587557 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first games where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1587558 weve won four games here and now its a matter of winning eight games in a row
1587559 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1587560 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1587561 we have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law
1587562 the supreme court has ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules
1587563 its silence is no surprise the united states has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access
1587564 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1587565 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jose medellins execution goes forward

1587582 barack wants to focus on new technology to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling
1587583 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
1587584 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which would then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved

1587591 i know much has been made of sort of the correlation between forces coming down in iraq and going up in afghanistan
1587592 and while that certainly would seem to be the most natural transaction to take place the truth is were nearly 2 5 million strong around the world we have the means to draw forces elsewhere whether it be through reserves or national guard or drawing down from other places around the world where we have commitments
1587593 we have first commitments across the globe and threats and contingencies we need to be situated for beyond just the wars in iraq and afghanistan

1587627 i told the president lee im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about uranium enrichment activities as well as nuclear testing and proliferation and ballistic missile programmes
1587628 the best way to approach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1587629 the north korean leader has yet to fully verify a highly enriched uranium programme and there are still more steps to be done on the plutonium programme
1587630 at this moment the tibetans inside tibet are brutally and violently being crushed by chinese authorities

1587634 excessive adulation of barack obama is harmful to the vision and can in extreme cases cause hallucinations
1587635 the promise of obamas presidency in many peoples minds is partly that america will move toward becoming a post racial society
1587636 its pretty clear though that we arent there yet when white people are invited to think about obamas physical appearance the principal attribute theyre likely to dwell on is his dark skin consequently any reference to obamas other physical attributes cant help coming off as a coy walk around the barn
1587637 size of obamas ears the thickness of obamas eyebrows and so on
1587638 create the space for the most reactionary and even fundamentalist religious leaders to take control of minority communities
1587639 the sentiments recently expressed by the archbishop of canterbury and the lord chief justice concerning sharia law are very telling in the rush to be tolerant or sensitive to religious difference they create the space for the most reactionary and even fundamentalist religious leaders to take control of minority communities and they enable a climate which allows religion to define our roles in both private and public spaces
1587640 their sentiments appear contingent on the false assumption that black and minority cultures are intrinsically opposed to universal human rights principles and that they do not contribute to the body of law based on such principles that now inform the english legal system in doing so they allow religious and cultural contexts to become the overriding framework within which those from ethnic and religious minorities are perceived inevitably drawing on very narrow assumptions about religion and the role of women

1587677 were monitoring the safety of the hpv vaccine very carefully and the only adverse event that causes some concern is fainting after the vaccine
1587678 higher rates of guillain barr have been associated with the swine flu vaccine and possibly with the meningitis vaccine menactra but it is no more common in those who get gardasil than in those who dont
1587679 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children

1587710 i remember when this was the brooklyn place to see and be seen
1587711 these officials have no idea what shape this theater was in when i bought it two years ago
1587712 this place has to be completely gutted from the infrastructure on up because it was built in a different era

1587728 i personally believe online casino marketing practices of today that are thought of as inappropriate will be the future of tomorrows online casino industry leaders
1587729 we need to stick to our guns and abide by best practice methods in order to preserve the integrity of the online casino industry as a whole if we degrade ourselves by using cheap marketing practices to make a quick buck we will only be hurting ourselves in the long run

1587752 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1587753 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1587754 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1587755 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1587756 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity

1587814 the race will start in suburban tukwila proceed along the shores of lake washington and offer scenic views of puget sound and mt rainier before finishing in downtown seattle at qwest field
1587815 theres a short life expectancy in distance running which is why most careers only last into the early to mid 30s a 35 year old is an old man in this sport
1587816 im hoping to make it through two other olympic cycles after beijing that would put me at 33 and that would be a long career
1587817 you never know what to expect thats why in this profession you have to strike while the irons hot
1587818 ill carry that with me all the way to beijing and remember just how bad that was
1587819 because of that i have a lot of determination going into beijing to make sure im as prepared as possible to do great
1587820 the workouts went great we ran in hotter conditions than we expect to see in beijing
1587821 unless i cant walk and my lungs are falling out or im coughing up a lung ill be running
1587822 it was just too much of a risk for me to run in london and i apologize to the british fans for not running there
1587823 i am still a marked man because i am defending world champion in the hurdles everybody is coming for me
1587824 it was kind of risky but thats the chance you have to take to excel in athletics you have to take chances
1587825 should i quit track i have this economics degree i could get a job and earn a salary
1587826 theres such a small margin of error in track and field that small margin of error can change your life completely
1587827 ive had to grow and learn i guess it goes with the event hurdles is a learning technical event
1587828 would fall under the new wada code that carries a four year ban

1587831 the increasingly large and sophisticated marijuana plantations are very often the work of dangerous drug cartels

1587835 i dont want to piss my friends off too much when i kick their ass at tuesday trivia at woodstocks
1587836 in this light i think of our findings mostly as opening the door for creative thinking
1587837 an appreciation of where most of the biomass lies for an infectious disease might help direct where you focus your efforts in controlling the disease
1587838 therefore understanding that there is a large biomass of infectious agent inside hosts might open the door to new ideas on how to treat the disease
1587839 there might be creative ways to deal with being sick that also pay attention to the large biomass and energetics of infectious agents within individual hosts
1587840 it might really help us figure out whats really causing the sickness or where it would be best to limit or break the success of the infection or where it would be best to help the host fight the infection
1587841 parasites are generally out of sight and have frequently been out of mind in the planning and implementation of ecological studies
1587842 what weve found is that they really shouldnt be out of mind this is because they are there and in large amounts
1587843 whenever there is a major construction project like this there is an impact on the public
1587844 private vehicles will be the most impacted it wont be the easiest place to drive but service vehicles will be allowed to bring supplies to the commercial businesses along pardall
1587845 the most interesting part of the plan is that the sidewalk on the sunny side of pardall the sams to go side will be expanded 12 feet out so youll have a big promenade with outdoor caf space where people can eat and shop
1587846 i dont think it will have a big impact on sales people are going to have to eat theyll come
1587847 in a way itll be good for business itll give us more room because were going to extend the seating outward too besides the streets need to be changed up anyway its a mess out there now
1587848 for being as dangerous for cyclists as they are its amazing how few people are injured in those intersections on pardall road
1587849 the improvements will limit vehicle traffic and be much more friendly for pedestrians and bikers
1587850 most people did not want cars on the block but wanted a pedestrian mall like the one on campus
1587851 her favorite place in santa barbara was without a doubt the co op where jaymie worked so closely with people who shared the same interests and passions that she had felt so strongly about
1587852 i have made it my mission to raise awareness in everything she believed in including fair trade and raw organic foods
1587853 she had this huge beautiful smile and this amazing amazing amount of energy
1587854 she was always so excited and looking forward to life she has had this incredible exuberance since the minute she popped out jaymie is a beautiful soul
1587855 i know that every professor who had her thought she was an exceptional being she always had a lot of enthusiasm and stood out in her classes in a lot of ways jaymie was always bright and shiny and full of life she brought so much positivity into the world every day
1587856 she was one of the most amazing people that i have ever known
1587857 shes the kind of person who could light up a room just by walking into it her laugh and smile were contagious and looking back i think i will miss those the most she was so involved and passionate about every aspect of her life and always gave 120 percent in everything she did although she may be gone her spirit and love for life will live on in my heart forever
1587858 this is nothing less than a case of attempted homicide
1587859 its unconscionable that any reasonable person would consider this an acceptable tactic to get their point across we are working hard with the other agencies and committing all available resources to follow all possible leads we urge anyone with information to come forward
1587860 the attacks on members of the academic community that occurred this past weekend in santa cruz are outrageous and abhorrent
1587861 acts of violence and intimidation such as these are unacceptable and they continue a troubling pattern seen at ucla and other uc campuses that should be repugnant to us all these acts threaten not only our academic researchers and their families but the safety and security of neighbors in our communities as well
1587862 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
1587863 the campus is taking this extremely seriously and is working closely with law enforcement agencies and our own campus resources to identify and apprehend the perpetrators as well as taking major proactive steps to support researchers in the face of violence and intimidation the personal safety and security of all our students faculty and staff is our highest priority
1587864 but there have been numerous meetings with faculty to provide emotional support as well as concrete security measures such as providing faculty the option of having their homes evaluated for safety we also have stepped up police patrols in the city of santa cruz as well as ucsc
1587865 we will work at the campuses to provide the best possible support to members of our academic community who deserve to work and raise their families in a safe environment
1587866 and we will continue to work in sacramento with assemblyman gene mullin for the passage of his ab 2296 which aims to provide more tools to law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of these crimes

1587871 while we have seen very little benefit from these prices thus far in 2008 due to lower priced contracts that were signed in 2006 and 2007 we believe that our shareholders will begin to see the benefits during the remaining months of 2008 and a much greater benefit beginning in early 2009
1587872 the market has finally begun to turn in a positive direction the single biggest issue that we have faced during the past several years has been pressure on profit margins this pressure has been due to extremely low coal prices and rapidly rising costs particularly in underground mining due to changes in the safety and regulatory environment
1587873 the most important thing is only do it when you only do something one hundred percent then there is no subject no object there is no inside or outside inside and outside already become one that means you and the universe are never separate there is no thinking

1587882 we are in touch with the chinese authorities and are requesting immediate consular access should this information be correct
1587883 ill probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country but i believe its not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living under the occupation of the chinese government
1587884 for years the chinese government has tried to use the olympics to legitimise its illegal occupation of tibet
1587885 at this very moment tibetans are facing the most severe and violent repression they have seen in decades at the hands of the chinese government and we have taken non violent action at this critical time to draw the worlds attention to the crisis gripping tibet
1587886 we have selected an amount that we believe is comfortable for the whole period of temporary public ownership
1587887 we are clearly looking at a housing market which has deteriorated very considerably in recent months
1587888 we do think the economic climate and the housing market is going to be difficult for some considerable time
1587889 the future is going to be governed very considerably by what happens in the wider economy house prices in particular and what happens in terms of how house prices flow through to the loan book

1587911 some think that we are mere atoms of matter tossed to and fro speaker reed once said great events of history were brought about by an intelligent and infinite being if you will reflect a little you will be led to the conclusion that as tennyson writes through the ages one increasing purpose runs
1587912 if there be a purpose running through the life of the world is it not plain that one thought in the divine plan was that in this republic should be unfolded and developed in the presence of the world the christian doctrine of the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man

1587921 one work which did focus on strategy was a little book the trajectory of change activist strategies for social transformation
1587922 short term we raise social costs until elites agree to implement our demands or end policies we oppose longer term we accumulate support and develop movement infrastructure and alternative institutions while working toward transforming societys defining relations
1587923 i like this and that but i believe that the basic institutions of society are unalterable at least in their defining features so whatever my likes and dislikes are i will pursue changes in context of assuming the persistence of those defining institutions
1587924 oh it is reformist you see how albert says he wants to win reforms you see how he thinks that a movement should seek reforms that shows he is reformist
1587925 hey i dont want an end to war or terminate the wto or win higher wages or affirmative action
1587926 that is we cannot force the state to end a particular war or to grant universal health care but it may do it if the rulers fear that there will be a spread of radicalization among the people if there is increased militancy among workers youth soldiers and people of color if society becomes increasingly polarized and ungovernable this is precisely what happened in the 60s and which led to the end of legal racial segregation and of the vietnam war
1587927 so far so good a revolutionary anarchist would completely agree with this orientation as opposed to the liberal strategy of permeating the centers of power and making changes from above it proposes to pressure the state and capitalists from outside and below it demonstrates why a revolutionary perspective is relevant even in non revolutionary periods which are most of the time the more militant and disrespectful a movement is that is the more revolutionary it is the more likely it is even to win reforms
1587928 does albert believe in revolutionary processes that i price find convincing
1587929 our commitment to ultimately revolutionize all aspects of life this country needs a revolution
1587930 he regards himself as a revolutionary what he means by revolutionary however is someone who advocates a totally new society which he does
1587931 but i dont think they are attainable instead i think the best we can hope for is to ameliorate current ills via reforms
1587932 there have been differences between those socialists who hoped to reach a new society by gradual peaceful and legal changes and those who believed that eventually there would have to be a confrontation with the capitalist state its overthrow and dismantling
1587933 i am for parecon parpolity etc i am for revolution
1587934 to point out that the state will not permit peaceful gradual legal changes to a better social system it is to warn the people that when the economy gets worse the capitalists will take back the reforms they have given in the past as they have begun to do at some point when the capitalists feel threatened enough they will whip up racist and sexual hysteria they will abandon bourgeois democracy cancel elections organize fascist gangs smash unions murder leftists and arrange a military coup
1587935 working people need to prepare to defend ourselves to strengthen unions and to engage in general city wide strikes we need to popularize the idea of workers and community councils for replacing the state and of an armed working class for replacing the specialized police and military
1587936 none of this is in alberts work he wants a drastic change in society but he does not expect it to need a revolution what most people would mean by revolution on the order of the u s french or russian revolutions he does not warn of the dangers of counterrevolutionary fascist repression
1587937 albert believes in building a militant mass movement but he believes that one way this can be done is through electoralism
1587938 not only does he support third party capitalist candidates nader the green party but he supported jesse jacksons campaign inside the capitalist racist pro war imperialist democratic party albert 1994
1587939 seemed surprised when the so called rainbow coalition turned from movement building to supporting jacksons deal making
1587940 working with capitalist parties is not only na ve but it crosses the class line
1587941 does not warn the workers that parecon cannot be voted in the capitalist state is designed to prevent that even if pareconists won an election the result would be something like when lincoln won the 1860 election the slaveowners refused to accept their defeat taking the leading military officers and organized to overthrow the government and break up the country in a bloody counterrevolution
1587942 albert believes in building alternate institutions in the present to demonstrate how parecon might work such institutions coops collectives democratic publishing groups etc would face not only the state but the forces of the marketplace where capitalism is dominant many such attempts fail others succeed only to be integrated into the capitalist economy these organizations are good in themselves but cannot play a major role in changing capitalism i live in a self administered housing coop run by the tenants without even a professional manager it provides good housing but is not a threat to the bourgeoisie
1587943 in 1978 writing with robin hahnel he sketched out how a socialist revolution might be carried out there would be a revolutionary councilist organization or party in workplaces and neighborhoods the revolutionaries would organize people to fight back over economic racial gender and other issues they would seek to build popular councils of workers and oppressed people to replace state functions in the communities and to challenge the managers in factories and workplaces workers councils would take over the worksites neighborhood councils would take over the communities the councils would federate the revolutionary organization would dissolve into the councils this would be the contest for power against the state and capitalism to be followed by building a new society
1587944 as the councilist movement spread and solidified there would be an increasing danger of state repression the authors main response to this is the need to avoid adventurism or premature strikes they had previously mentioned the need for peoples patrols but that is only to deal with juvenile delinquency and mugging p 336 they refer to mass struggles all without and also often with militant self defense p 337 which is rather vague
1587945 they wrote that readers may interpret this sketch to imply an essentially non violent dynamic p 352 which seems reasonable to me but they deny this
1587946 there is considerable violence likely during the whole preparatory series of struggles leading up to the actual final seizure of power but the seizure itself and the following period of construction will likely be relatively peaceful
1587947 they expect to have won over most of the ranks of the military as well as the big majority of the population by the time of a seizure of power
1587948 the prediction of repression and considerable violence during the preparatory period of struggles has dropped out of alberts writings as has the concept of a final seizure of power programmatically he has abandoned talk of a need for peoples patrols and miltant self defense
1587949 to be so sure that the seizure of power itself and the following period of construction will likely be relatively peaceful is to disarm the workers and oppressed ahead of time
1587950 for reasons of space i have not discussed other aspects of michael alberts program such as his concept of non reformist reforms his view of the working class his odd belief that the managerial coordinators are not a pro capitalist class or his odder admiration for ho chi minh and che guevera who were hardly antistatist marxists
1587951 like me albert comes out of the councilist antistatist tradition of socialist anarchism and libertarian marxism although he no longer calls himself a socialist
1587952 like us he aims for an economy which is neither centrally planned nor market oriented he believes that a movement needs a vision of a better world although i do not think it needs to be as detailed as his parecon blueprint he also agrees with us about building a democratic movement from below which challenges the centers of capitalist power by threatening them from outside
1587953 there are many areas where we revolutionary anarchists can work with albert and others who advocate parecon however there are fundamental weaknesses in his program for achieving a new society as in the thinking of robin hahnel that is of both of the founders of parecon

1587971 our approach for classes in diablo iii is that we dont have a strong desire to bring back classes from the previous game
1587972 the goal is to try and give people new gameplay and not just re hash old gameplay were not just making a diablo ii with updated 3d graphics
1587973 the problem was we looked at the class and didnt think that we could really make him a lot better
1587974 we could add some new stuff to him but for the most part curses corpse explosion skeleton pets done thats the class we wanted to create new gameplay so we chose to do the witch doctor as a different kind of class

1587986 corey used to bowl a lot when he was in junior high and we even held his bar mitzvah party at arlington lanes so we decided to hold this fundraiser there
1587987 they have 40 lanes and should be able to accommodate a lot of people we are expecting between 150 and 200 to come
1587988 i hope that corey would be happy with what we have been doing because everything we are funding were his favorite projects
1587989 we really have to look at why were doing it
1587990 i think it is something we will ultimately have to do
1587991 oppose the enactment of any legislation that would infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms
1587992 you cannot say i like this and i dont like this
1587993 if there is legislation to ban armor piercing ammunition that would penetrate the body armor worn by sheriffs deputies i do not have a problem with that if there is legislation that would ban 50 caliber sniper rifles that can kill from 3 000 yards away i do not have a problem with that
1587994 i have to think about all the deaths in this county that are the result of guns all the kids who are dead because of guns

1588002 it validates the concerns we raised but it doesnt provide any viable solutions
1588003 to date the parties conducting todays hearing have not yet acknowledged the significant public benefits this transaction would provide to the regional economy and to dozens of chicago area communities that would see a reduction in freight traffic as a result of the transaction
1588004 the reality is that if this transaction were approved more than 60 communities would experience rail congestion relief roughly two times the number that would see increased rail traffic
1588005 the negative impacts that are measurable far outweigh the measurable benefits
1588006 approval of this rail sale will be totally life changing
1588007 if they want to operate on that line then they have the obligation to pay for the mitigation
1588008 thousands of people in towns that abut the existing cn lines stand to benefit from reductions in rail and highway congestion a decrease in train noise and relative improvements to safety
1588009 it would also set the stage for possible enhancements to metra service
1588010 the way to resolve the problem is not to shift the problem its is to not make it a problem for anyone
1588011 we need to take a step back and see how we want to move freight traffic through the region

1588133 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1588134 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1588135 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1588136 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1588137 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1588138 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1588193 in some respects the bush administration is simply following a familiar path by responding to real dangers with illegal and deplorable methods
1588194 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1588195 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1588196 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia
1588197 brenda wineapple brings a scholars diligence and a novelists imagination to her account of dickinson and higginsons relationship crafting a tour de force that should delight specialists and casual readers alike the books individual strands of inquiry higginsons life dickinsons poems the letters that passed between them and the historical political and artistic contexts of the age are interesting in and of themselves but when intertwined so as to inform and strengthen each other theyre fascinating
1588198 a good and happy child is so well done that part of me wishes i had missed it i like to sleep soundly at night
1588199 this sly and discombobulating flight of whimsy by david deans is in a sense a book length joke and nothing drains the humor from a good joke as effectively as vivisecting it has comenius hallucinated his transformation and if so where did he acquire his knowledge of kafka and rilke of orpheus and lady macbeth is bob a good guy after all is he even out of town let alone in mexico and where is miss scarlett anyway mr deans may or may not provide the answers to these queries but the readers irresistible desire to know is evidence that hes pulled off a splendid joke
1588200 despite its specific american flavors travel writing seems most like a contemporary french novel such as those by christian oster and gregoire bouillier a book in which an atmosphere of established and almost enviable dailiness underwrites sophisticated narrative conceits truth matters less than the telling and that makes for a cool easy kind of fiction its not hemingway or borges or even dashiell hammett but its nice
1588201 have i raved enough i feel as if im barrys publicist or agent maybe shell give me a cut of the 2 million but i did love this book it didnt matter if i was in a bad mood or tired or had other things to do i wanted to read this book i wanted to be living in these characters minds hanging out in salem or on yellow dog island does the novel deserve the hype i certainly dont begrudge it
1588202 the now forgotten us immigrants to the soviet union in the early thirties were communist sympathisers or more often desperate victims of the depression at first they were feted waves of repression however ensured that they and their descendants ended up either in russias prisons or as inmates of the gulag this is a powerful important and highly readable book the gulag is no novelty but tzouliadis brilliantly links high politics to the torment of innocents adding devastating detail
1588203 the process of government can be annoying in its obsessive repetition of its main theme in its lack of interest in empirical evidence and yet its one of those rare books which change the way you look at the world
1588204 it would be difficult to find any precedent in american history for the scale brutality and illegality of the torture and degradation inflicted on detainees over the last six years
1588205 it would be even harder to imagine a set of policies more likely to increase the dangers facing the united states and the world
1588206 barrassos approach to the pi genre might be considered a softer version of sue grafton but her touch is as deft
1588207 there is something mythic about the date of publication and you actually come to believe that on this one particular morning you will wake up to a phone ringing off the hook and your publisher will be so excited that they will have hired the blue angels precision flying team to buzz your squalid little hovel which you will be moving out of as soon as sales of the book really take off or at least they will remember to send flowers
1588208 the past though it cannot be relived can always be repaired

1588224 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1588228 there has been much publicity regarding the uncertain macro economic settings including higher interest rates higher fuel costs and the uncertainty surrounding capital markets chairman jennifer hill ling said in a statement
1588229 many of our business units operate in markets that still exhibit growth despite these factors
1588230 we expect some improvements in businesses that have underperformed this year and the diversity of our businesses further mitigates the risks associated with these economic settings she added
1588231 hills is not heavily exposed to the domestic housing cycle and as such we expect a satisfactory result in the year ahead
1588232 overall finance approvals are now down a quarter since its peak earlier in the year
1588233 this obviously has been a key part of the reserve bank thinking
1588234 they would have had this data on hand with their decision yesterday
1588235 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1588236 falls in approvals are on a par with previous cycles
1588237 but it is much more concentrated in purchase for established dwellings
1588238 to have a 25 per cent fall in finance approvals in five months would have them a little bit worried
1588239 the deceleration is much more abrupt than they would like
1588240 as a leading indicator of building approvals and commencements the series suggest further weakness with housing likely to detract from activity in 2008 and into 2009
1588241 the construction sector is one of the largest employers accounting for around 10 per cent of total employment with the related property amp business services accounting for 12 per cent of total employment
1588242 todays data are supportive of the rbas newly adopted easing bias
1588243 coetzees vision is impressively consistent his books eschew loosened abundance for impacted allegory
1588244 people like novels that however intelligently tell them what to think
1588245 is very subtle and refined so that much of the time he does not really seem to be telling us what to think better still his novels self consciously display an involvement in their own modes of presentation so that coetzee will often seem to be telling us what to think about being told what to think which is still a species of being told what to think of course
1588246 would not be out of place in a mass market thriller it is the sheerest conventionality it is cheap writing literally cost saving
1588247 is little more than a conduit for coetzees taut language
1588248 a very good writer and not a great writer coetzee emits prize pheromones
1588249 prize juries are known more often than not for their invincible wrong headedness
1588250 recommended a novel by clare messud to his fellow judges conveniently forgetting to mention that she was his wife

1588253 i know it was wrong but it is my life
1588254 its my life im an adult i can choose what i want
1588255 what have you ever done that made you feel ecstatically happy
1588256 what makes you want to be awake rather than be sleeping
1588257 but yes its true yes i am greedy and i want you not to have anything even a cent so you should start shaking in fear because i will exhause all the ground that you are standing
1588258 fluffy is slowing down i just figured its because shes getting old
1588259 rotfl i hope youre getting payola maybe just complementary samples
1588260 i think you have a choice to do it to keep going to school or just stay at home and do nothing
1588261 sometimes i ditching the school but not much like maybe one day per week
1588262 this year i dont want to be missing the class i want to go to school for reals sic
1588263 we would have 100 percent absent if the school didnt exist were serving students who arent in school otherwise
1588264 really every day any student is coming to our school it is a win for us
1588265 it was not uncommon for kids to miss 50 days and then expect to be able to make up that work
1588266 we were required to give kids the benefit of being in an alternative school while in theory it may look ok on paper in practice it was a disaster
1588267 these students were still getting credit we were still passing them and i found it to be non educational
1588268 i think were setting them up for failure i think were setting them up for an environment out of school that doesnt exist
1588269 if they can make up the extra work theyve missed then why wouldnt we give them credit for it
1588270 you might say thats atrocious i would say we are dealing with the most at risk kids in colorado all in one building and this is their last chance
1588271 we take them here we nurture them here and we try to give them credit and we certainly give them the language acquisition which is very important
1588272 nothing really replaces being in a classroom being with an educator being with someone who has been taught how to teach students and work with students and interact with them on a daily basis
1588273 you have to make sure that what you put in policy is enforceable and that youre going after it and enforcing it
1588274 students learn very quickly whether or not we are serious about having them in school each day
1588275 were willing to wear that as a badge of honor and say guess what we dont care that were going to be at the bottom of the barrel
1588276 were actually going to try to teach these kids english and give them a high school education
1588277 we try to recruit kids its a marketing thing just like you have products on the shelves
1588278 we have a very important product and that product is education and we think we do it better than a lot of other places
1588279 were basically putting bait on a hook dangling it in front of students and then after the october count it was like well well just snip the fishing line and we dont really care anymore because we have our money
1588280 the new america school is a non profit were not squirreling away dollars in the central office
1588281 its through the generosity of the jared polis foundation that keeps us afloat every year
1588282 als berater haben sie aber noch ein zweites problem auf der einen seite m ssen sie darstellen dass sie sich mit einem oder mehreren themen sehr gut auskennen auf der anderen seite d rfen sie aber nicht so viel wissen preisgeben dass sie sich selbst berfl ssig machen blogging ist daher aus beratersicht nur begrenzt einsetzbar

1588284 i would solve a lot of literary problems just thinking about a character in the subway where you cant do anything anyway
1588285 i think mosby seidells new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts
1588286 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things
1588287 i think teaching this story will be highly educational for my baseball betting students irregardless of what critics believe
1588288 heck if we always listened to critics nothing would be sold they serve a purpose but i leave the fact checking to qualified historians and researchers
1588289 we stocked our shelves with double the normal number of first editions for this major baseball betting biographical novel release
1588290 and we expect to sell out very fast sharlene hoffs baseball betting book brought hundreds of pre sale orders and numerous bulk order requests so the question of whether or not well sell out is moot
1588291 it will be a top seller im sure and even though it is meant for those familiar with the baseball betting literary world many others may find it of general interest as well
1588292 i fully expect a sequel to be release within six months
1588293 typically we see interest wane a year after the initial release so it is important to stay on schedule and release subsequent books at pique points of public interest
1588294 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the baseball betting industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
1588295 because the work that has been done in the baseball betting literary area has been huge
1588296 with the release of nol sacres new baseball betting book were going to see record traffic levels
1588297 pre sale polls show this new baseball betting book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
1588298 and i believe ladnier neislers book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
1588299 the most thorough manner to approach baseball betting is through a methodical analysis of trends upward and downward movement and of course changes in the consumer aread
1588300 ive been working in the baseball betting field for years now and just expanded my operations to the internet sales have doubled in no time
1588301 i think we should let our children develop cancer or heart disease when they are aged because it would be unfair for them to live much longer than people in other countries
1588302 chris mussman we are going to have to ask more guys to pitch in and probably have to see a better effort and more production from guys like garret glover jake caufield brady trenbeath brandon brady josh murray and danny freund and just distribute the ball a little more and basically not be as two dimensional as we were and just be a little bit more open and have to spread the ball around
1588303 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport
1588304 to me the olympics were founded on amateur sport guys go in there and train for four years putting their whole lives on the line to win a gold medal
1588305 if i was running the olympics i would go back to the way it was originally
1588306 gymnastics weightlifting swimming and track and field and marathons thats to me what the olympics is
1588307 it is not about tennis or golf or anything like that
1588308 those are three sports where guys are getting paid a lot of money to play and compete week in and week out it is so professional
1588309 i think having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1588310 and the reason for that is it would bring 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and the revenues that would be going towards the growth of the game of golf
1588311 they olympics would bring us to new markets on a worldwide scale and i cant imagine how big the game can become in countries like china and india
1588312 i think the criticism is that not enough countries play it
1588313 out of the depths have i cried unto thee o lord if thou shouldest mark iniquities o lord who shall stand
1588314 jesp re que laxe du mal nexiste plus cest ce que jesp re pour le bien de la paix et pour le bien de nos enfants

1588350 it is not an incident that we are aware of
1588351 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1588352 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1588353 it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight

1588360 people are being more discerning not going out as often but making it count when they do they want to go to places they know will look after them and that they can trust
1588361 we are still doing well around north cheshire but our liverpool and newcastle restaurants are performing even better
1588362 i think he showed in kansas city how much help hes going to be
1588363 its like the first day of school when you try to find your way around
1588364 we are not asking him to be our every day center fielder
1588365 we were only going to ask him to go out there when he feels great we have the luxury of the designated hitter on this team we have the luxury of giving a guy a day off
1588366 this trade was just as much about having a day to day lineup that is consistent as it was against insulating ourselves against one of those unforeseen things certainly none of it was about him going out and playing center field every day
1588367 hes here just to be a part of this team and nothing more
1588368 i think its surprised me how quick hes fit in with the ballclub
1588369 when you come to a ballclub and you dont know that many people you feel a little bit uncomfortable no matter who you are or what you do in baseball i think this ballclub has great guys and have made him feel comfortable here
1588370 hes not same griffey we know but hes still got it he still knows what hes doing we just need to start pitching if we dont it doesnt matter if griffey goes 4 for 4 every day
1588371 i think it is apparent that the people who prepared this get an f
1588372 it validates the concerns we raised but it doesnt provide any viable solutions
1588373 to date the parties conducting todays hearing have not yet acknowledged the significant public benefits this transaction would provide to the regional economy and to dozens of chicago area communities that would see a reduction in freight traffic as a result of the transaction
1588374 the reality is that if this transaction were approved more than 60 communities would experience rail congestion relief roughly two times the number that would see increased rail traffic
1588375 the negative impacts that are measurable far outweigh the measurable benefits
1588376 approval of this rail sale will be totally life changing
1588377 if they want to operate on that line then they have the obligation to pay for the mitigation
1588378 thousands of people in towns that abut the existing cn lines stand to benefit from reductions in rail and highway congestion a decrease in train noise and relative improvements to safety
1588379 it would also set the stage for possible enhancements to metra service
1588380 the way to resolve the problem is not to shift the problem its is to not make it a problem for anyone
1588381 we need to take a step back and see how we want to move freight traffic through the region
1588382 i dont like putting time tables on any player because sometimes that puts undue pressure on a player to get back earlier or then it turns into a day to day watch
1588383 structurally we sent him back for an mri ct scan and hes clean as far as thats concerned just a little bit of pressing on a nerve that weve got to alleviate before we can get him back on a rehab on one hand theres a delay but on the other hand the prognosis is good and well go from there
1588384 the waiver process is in full force now and people started running names through well continue to look to get better but seeing as what the trade market turned out to be im not anticipating very much coming about

1588434 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee

1588494 because youve got a responsible personality a gorgeous body and youre absolutely sexy when youre submissive
1588495 something in that formula enhances the mutual attraction from the person that looks at you so it doesnt change any ones personalities too much they are still themselves but they fall in love with you under their consciousness instead of going totally out of character
1588496 why should you be thinking about koharu when you should be worrying about me the groping demon of hello project

1588546 it also seems that some sectors that were not considered to be noisy workplaces are in fact more harmful than thought the world is becoming a noisier and noisier place
1588547 although excessive exposure to loud noise over a period of time is known to be the cause why this is occurring in large numbers in certain industry sectors isnt clear as permanent loss usually takes some time to develop
1588548 it seems another of these offences that is increasing due to the economy perhaps
1588549 these prices are in line with expectation and reflect the current commodity market environment
1588550 the good news is we think weve got security footage so lets see if we will work our way through it
1588551 i think the issue really is is why the national party says one thing to the voters in public and another behind closed doors

1588560 your eminence when father john carroll who was to become the first american bishop accompanied benjamin franklin to qu bec to ask that the canadians join in the american revolution the then bishop briand of qu bec forbade his priests to have anything to do with the visitors and he actually excommunicated john carroll
1588561 bishop briand had his reasons in that the british had guaranteed the catholics of qu bec freedom of religion a freedom which was not guaranteed at that time in the original thirteen rebellious colonies where catholics were often discriminated against
1588562 bishop briand saw no reason for canadians to join the american colonies against the british and he was very annoyed that a catholics priest should be among those seeking to encourage canadians to risk their religious liberty in what he considered to be a dubious cause so he excommunicated father carroll and there is no record of which i know that such an excommunication has ever been lifted
1588563 in the interest of better canadian american relations and in recognition of the fact that americans now enjoy religious liberty i would deeply appreciate it if you might lift the excommunication against john carroll

1588565 uk pension schemes of ftse 100 companies enjoyed a brief period of surplus until early in 2008
1588566 some companies chose to spend their surpluses on various forms of de risking activity including buy out purchasing financial swaps and reducing their exposure to equities
1588567 events of the last year demonstrate the importance of assessing and managing pension risks and being prepared to take opportunities when they present themselves
1588568 it is inevitable that employers will keep on closing schemes to both new and existing members especially in the face of so much uncertainty around funding and costs

1588598 i think there is an issue associated with enforcement theyve looked at that as a government we continue to look at
1588599 by and large we just cant be complacent about this we have to realise that if we are serious about every life and making initiatives to try and save every life weve got to have a conversation with the community
1588600 its extraordinary the government would know this was the case and not do anything about it

1588643 why are you spending so much time on this one
1588644 have you seen my spec sheet on her she has to be completely washable but not plastic have over 200 movable parts all replaceable and able to run on diet coke and leftovers have a lap that can hold four children at one time have a kiss that can cure anything from a scraped knee to a broken heart and she will do everything with only two hands
1588645 only two hands no way and thats just on the standard model thats too much work for one day wait until tomorrow to finish
1588646 i am so close to finishing this creation that is so close to my own heart she already heals herself when she is sick and can work 18 hour days
1588647 but i have also made her tough you have no idea what she can endure or accomplish
1588648 not only will she be able to think she will be able to reason and negotiate
1588649 oops it looks like you have a leak in this model i told you that you were trying to put too much into this one
1588650 the tear is her way of expressing her joy her sorrow her pain her disappointment her love her loneliness her grief and her pride
1588651 you are a genius lord you thought of everything woman is truly amazing
1588652 no now would not be a good time to vacuum
1588653 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1588654 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant you know they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true
1588655 instead of calling on his partys leadership to return to congress and carve out an all of the above approach to americas energy crisis barack obama would rather tell commuters to inflate their car tires
1588656 you remember george bushs energy policy which was basically to turn to dick cheney and say here dick
1588657 and so dick in his inestimable wisdom decided hed meet with the renewable energy groups once and then hed meet with the oil and gas companies 40 times and so not surprisingly the laws he came up with were very good for the oil and gas companies but they werent so good for you
1588658 senator mccain has taken a page out of the bush cheney playbook hes offered a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1588659 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1588660 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said
1588661 these can save someones life so its not a laughing matter
1588662 i mean really guys let me give you a suggestion for instance shut the fuck up

1589123 but really i was just trying to get a base hit after barmy did
1589124 i do think getting a big hit in a situation like that sparked the team a little bit and it carried over into the next inning
1589125 lannan pitched about as good a ballgame for seven innings as ive seen here except for one pitch that let us capture some momentum
1589126 i tried to relax and not get so mad at myself
1589127 the third inning featuring costly throwing errors by aaron cook and shortstop troy tulowitzki was as ugly as a velvet elvis painting
1589128 we dont make excuses and we arent about to start
1589129 you make plays or you dont make plays the bottom line is we didnt make plays we should have made
1589130 im eager to go out and compete and hopefully give us a chance to win
1589131 i think i can help this team a lot if im 100 percent and making good pitches
1589132 but his volume of pitches was good he was clean and crisp with his fastball command and his changeup the next step is to put him in a big league game
1589133 hes got to reacquire his feeling for the second basemans range and his own range
1589134 but by no means could we expect him to come in and perform at 100 percent i think hes done an above average job since hes gone over there

1589136 deemed sexually promiscuous video vixens not worthy of consideration if other black women speak up were considered angry black women who complain this society cant even see a woman like michelle obama all it sees is a black woman and attaches stereotypes
1589137 in my profession white men mentor young whites on how to succeed
1589138 theyre either indifferent to or dogmatically document the mistakes black women make their indifference is the worst because it means were invisible
1589139 weve perfected it because weve been doing it for so long but people dont appreciate the skill it requires and they dont recognize the toll it takes on us as human beings
1589140 i think one of the most interesting things about michelle obama is that what she and her husband are doing is pretty revolutionary these days and i dont mean running for president for a black man and woman in the u s to be happily married with children and working as partners to build a life let alone a life of service to others all while rearing their children together is downright revolutionary

1589150 to date the parties conducting todays hearing have not yet acknowledged the significant public benefits this transaction would provide to the regional economy and to dozens of chicago area communities that would see a reduction in freight traffic as a result of the transaction
1589151 the reality is that if this transaction were approved more than 60 communities would experience rail congestion relief roughly two times the number that would see increased rail traffic
1589152 the negative impacts that are measurable far outweigh the measurable benefits
1589153 approval of this rail sale will be totally life changing
1589154 if they want to operate on that line then they have the obligation to pay for the mitigation

1589254 open up new marketing opportunities and help promote the wales brand
1589255 this announcement reflects a more strategic approach to put wales on the world map and enhance welsh culture and identity on the worldwide web
1589256 there is little evidence to suggest that a cym domain will have substantial short term economic benefit for wales
1589257 the internet is the e engine for economic growth and wales needs top level access to deliver the innovation that we need
1589258 the internet is about to change radically and wales must be fully on board the new internet with a top level domain identity cym on a par with other economically growing communities
1589259 most of our customers come from london the south east and scotland but for tourist companies its a great idea
1589260 i think it offers another option for businesses to consider which is never a bad thing
1589261 for companies for which welshness is a key part of their proposition to their customers it maybe a useful marketing tool
1589262 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data
1589263 taken as a whole the proposed agreement vests golden leaf with such involvement and decision making power over the details of the project that it ceases to be a grant supporting independent objective work and analysis
1589264 having carefully considered the provisions of the proposed agreement we have concluded that it would not be wise or appropriate for the north carolina biotechnology center to proceed
1589265 our board was supportive of an impartial and factual education program
1589266 the grant would have supported activities consistent with that purpose
1589267 customer demand is strong we have a fantastic team and now weve got money

1589273 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports

1589297 daring and traditional groundbreaking and familiar apocalyptic and sentimental appealing to the broadest possible audience without insulting anyones intelligence
1589298 a cautionary tale with striking ecological implications the message is artfully interwoven into the plot
1589299 a perfectly acceptable family entertainment with cute monkeys the usual message of self empowerment and the eye popping animation weve come to take for granted
1589300 the plot couldnt be more boring and the animation is unattractive
1589301 its a strange feeling to see the summers most promising premise self destruct into something bizarre and unsatisfying but that is the
1589302 what starts out with a sense of quirky fun loses direction and devolves into a mishmash of story lines
1589303 lopes along and is best taken as a tale of a father and a daughter coming through a rough patch to a better place rather than as anything to do with actual real world politics
1589304 this reasonably entertaining movie falters by trying to be both a dark comedy and a sentimental treatise on family and country
1589305 nolan and his co writer brother jonathan saw a chance to go deeper into familiar characters and mythology a chance to meditate on darker than usual themes that have implications for the way we live now
1589306 the dark knight is a more thrilling intelligent morally complex and masterfully crafted film than any summer blockbuster in recent years
1589307 in the transition to film the mamma mia brain trust just couldnt resist overloading the story with unneeded improvements
1589308 its flat and predictable though the visuals are often striking
1589309 it feels like a wan version of the show one that has lost its otherworldly edge

1589311 this is the only part of my life that sucks
1589312 the earth summit will play an important role in reforming and strengthening the un as the centerpiece of the emerging system of democratic global governance
1589313 the only way of saving the world may be for industrial civilization to collapse deliberately seek poverty and set levels of mortality
1589314 we have to ride the theory of global warming even if it is wrong
1589315 a global warming treaty must be implemented even if there is no evidence of global warming
1589316 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule
1589317 the first 30 feet of water vapor absorbs 80 of the earths heat radiation you can go outside and spit and have the effect as doubling co2
1589318 drilling ice cores is a brutal system and a polluting procedure drastically disturbing the ice samples
1589319 more than 20 physical chemical processes operating in situ in the ice cores in cold water co2 is more than 70 times more soluble than nitrogen and more than 30 times more soluble than oxygen
1589320 only recently many years after the ice based edifice of anthropogenic warming had reached a skyscraper height
1589321 human beings may be responsible for less than 0 010 c of warming during the last century
1589322 presently there is simply no scientific basis for claims that the escalating cost of disasters is the result of anything other than increasing societal vulnerability
1589323 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
1589324 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
1589325 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
1589326 i am shocked shocked by the numbers of people who just dont care
1589327 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1589328 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1589329 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs
1589330 we were not as clear as we might have been
1589331 the environmental community understands that we have to have a starting point the next bill should be modified with the greens but also with those in the business community
1589332 the vast majority of green groups support the targets that are necessary to avoid the most dangerous impact of global warming
1589333 the solution for us next year is connecting gas prices and global warming we have to show voters that the solution to gas prices and the solution to global warming is the same
1589334 whats been lost on decision makers is that the cost of inaction will far exceed any costs of dealing with the problem now
1589335 it is elitist youd have to be so wealthy you dont notice the cost or so dedicated that the cost is irrelevant
1589336 the problems with energy prices have really happened in the last few months
1589337 we somehow failed in making that a priority and i think we have a huge amount of work to do on energy policy
1589338 you cannot drive home environmental legislation without considering the cost on the economy
1589339 theyre defeating themselves and hurting all of us on an issue that hurts all of us
1589340 the trouble comes when people try to attribute everything to global warming then the public gets skeptical about the claims
1589341 the post mortems of 700 koalas earlier this year showed koalas are now starving to death due to loss of food and the disease rates are going up
1589342 it would be a great tragedy if we stood by and let the koalas of southeast queensland be wiped out
1589343 we face total loss of koalas within 20 years we need to take on issues that in the past we have felt were too tough on residents frankly weve been too cautious and its time to take tougher action doing nothing is not an option
1589344 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
1589345 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
1589346 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
1589347 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
1589348 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
1589349 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

1589351 hes an exciting player and with our exciting brand of football hed be perfect for our team
1589352 hes a goal sneak and another great forward that would probably fit in with ebo brett ebter and motts daniel motlop
1589353 obviously he didak is a quality player hes had a fantastic year with collingwood and hed probably fit nicely into our side
1589354 the club would probably look at it sit down with him and talk to him to see if he fitted in with our culture and thigs like that
1589355 were not resting anyone i used the wrong word i must admit
1589356 i was asked about brad johnson and it is an opportunity for players with injuries to give them a break
1589357 scott did a bit of training on monday he was okay but not sensational
1589358 if hes not right im not going to play him i thought he would be a definite starter but it doesnt look likely now
1589359 pre season ive always been able to tick off as something that i enjoy i might actually still do pre season and not play
1589360 i think as the games got modernised ive been able to sort of roughly adjust to it in my own way the games sort of still suited me a bit
1589361 due to hip injuries and now my shoulder the time has come where injuries have got the better of me and it is time to move on
1589362 once i reached the decision the realisation was quite overwhelming to be able to just sit and watch the boys in the derby at the weekend knowing that i was on the sidelines was actually quite a relief

1589398 our initial investigation revealed that she was struck and thrown on the hood of the truck
1589399 she was carried on the hood for a short distance and fell off coming to rest on the side of the road then it looks like the offending vehicle literally drove over her bicycle and then just kept going down the road
1589400 she wasnt wearing a helmet and obviously we encourage any cyclist to wear one especially on route 1 which is a very busy road through branford with trucks and passenger vehicles and somewhat of a dangerous road to be riding on
1589401 because if id been there a few minutes earlier the driver could have hit me
1589402 the government is going to use these methods against the agents of change
1589403 but we should not be afraid because the time of change has come on september 5th the people are going to change the regime with a simpler weapon the vote
1589404 from now on legislative elections will be organised regularly with periodic renewal every four years according to constitutional law
1589405 we will not allow the bad examples from kenya and zimbabwe to repeat here
1589406 clearly we see that the electoral law is there to make difficulties for political parties to operate
1589407 now the latest scheme is well were going to drill offshore now i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey i understand how desperate folks are i met a guy who couldnt go on a job search that lost his job couldnt go on a job search because of the high price of gas just couldnt fill up his tank i met a teacher in south dakota who loved her job as a teacher on an indian reservation she had to quit because the drive was too far it was taking up too much of her paycheck i know how bad people are hurting so if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
1589408 senator obamas stance on offshore oil drilling has been mischaracterized
1589409 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1589410 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1589411 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into

1589436 twelve soldiers raped me in quick succession after which i was given half an hour rest then twelve more soldiers followed they all lined up outside the room waiting for their turn i bled so much and was in such pain i could not even stand up the next morning i was too weak to get up i could not eat i felt much pain and my vagina was swollen i cried and cried calling my mother i could not resist the soldiers because they might kill me so what else could i do every day from two in the afternoon to ten in the evening the soldiers lined up outside my room and the rooms of the six other women there i did not even have time to wash after each assault at the end of the day i just closed my eyes and cried my torn dress would be brittle from the crust that had formed from the soldiers dried semen i washed myself with hot water and a piece of cloth so i would be clean i pressed the cloth to my vagina like a compress to relieve that pain and the swelling

1589487 en tiempos estoy mejor que en los ltimos a os esto es porque la pista donde entrenamos era m s r pida aunque es verdad que las sensaciones son diferentes ahora soy m s s lido y no me noto tan cansado como antes en l neas generales estoy muy satisfecho con los resultados obtenidos

1589495 we met back at the groton football field and actually tore our own goal posts down

1589569 mr modi ordered a census ruled illegal by the gujarat high court of the christian community the same action he took prior to the orchestrated attacks on muslims in 2002
1589570 under his leadership the state of gujarat passed an anti conversion law in strong violation of the indian constitution and international human rights norms to which india is a party

1589626 well you just have to see how he progresses during the preseason a big thing in this system is trust in this system
1589627 the best thing i can tell you is that if youre a middle linebacker when you see something coming at you you go splatter it
1589628 but when you play some cover 2 now you cant because youre playing pass first they have to see if thats a run pass play action pass or a run and then go as soon as those guys get aggressive too quick in the seven man front you expose the middle of the field
1589629 its seven points if you make a misdiagnosis thats trust that middle linebacker is trust so you have to train them and train them and train them marinelli said
1589630 they can and they cant it depends on what theyre coming from hows that
1589631 theyre always a winning team and theyre always in the playoffs

1589638 it feels like youre hitting on sound at that point in time
1589639 hes one of those guys that obviously throws a very plus plus fastball in that situation all i was really trying to do was put the barrel on the ball hes generating so much power with his fastball if you hit it solidly which is rare its going to go a long way
1589640 i can count probably four other times that its been like this
1589641 going back to seattle five hundred homers 600 things like that and now here and cincinnati the first time

1589646 i think people are finding out how tough todd jones job was
1589647 we gave up too many home runs and made too many bad pitches up here you have to make pitches thats as simple as it it
1589648 if you dont you get hurt if you dont you get beat
1589649 if you throw 97 or 98 miles an hour its better up than down
1589650 he threw one down and they swisher dropped the head of the bat on it ever since hes been in the big leagues if he gets hurts by a long ball its because of a fastball down
1589651 i just think hes not getting the ball where he wants to get it but it wasnt just that inning we didnt keep the ball in the ballpark during the course of the game
1589652 it is easy to say we are going to be great and we are going to be the best now we have to go out and do it
1589653 all i can tell you is we had a great offseason the chemistry is great and we are jelling we put together a foundation to have a great year and to be the no 1 defense in the league now its about execution thats the hard part to do
1589654 but i can tell you we are going to be great but the hard thing is actually being great i can tell you that the linebackers are fast the defensive line is as good if not better than last year we have a lot of speed guys and we are going to put a lot of pressure on the offense
1589655 this is where you find out who really wants it
1589656 its time to suck it up and keep pounding this will benefit us during the season everybody came in in great shape and thats the one thing the coaches praised us about now we need to go out and execute the game plan each and every day
1589657 we are not just bringing in guys we had relationships with and who we were buddies with

1589663 when i succeed we will be rich beyond our dreams
1589664 you are surely on the verge of a breakthrough but you need one more ingredient to change base elements into gold and i have only recently discovered this secret
1589665 but i am too old to undertake the task it requires much work
1589666 the ingredient you need is the silver powder that grows on banana leaves this powder becomes magic when you plant the bananas yourself and cast certain spells upon it
1589667 and that is why i cannot complete the work myself
1589668 now i can show you how to turn base elements into gold but first you must bring your wife here we need her help
1589669 while your husband was collecting the banana powder what did you do with the fruits
1589670 um ok what do you want us to do about it
1589671 ok mr crackpot er i mean sir well send somebody out right away

1589673 the difference between a chicken and a pig when it comes to bacon and eggs is that the chicken is involved but the pig is committed
1589674 i told them i was going to do that too
1589675 were going to win and lose by them my success comes from the guys up front
1589676 i wont have one guy to focus on im sure one of those guys will emerge right now i think that group as a whole can contribute the way devin did last year
1589677 but it wasnt just devin the blocking design was there
1589678 everything that weve done throughout this summer spring our winter workout program has been about finishing
1589679 dan skuta their defensive tackle had 17 tackles against us last year and disrupted our whole game well have a chance to win if we find a way to block him
1589680 we only have two of the seven position coaches in the same position as last year
1589681 if we have a lead in the ninth inning thats who will pitch
1589682 hes hit him good and he knows him from the minors
1589683 thats my lineup im not going to explain my lineup

1589686 dick davis was the best land engineer i ever met
1589687 he could size up a piece of land right away
1589688 if he wanted something negotiated i did the bargaining if he had to be somewhere i appeared in his place i was his eyes his ears and his mouthpiece
1589689 he finally told me that he did not want me to see him because of the way in which he had allowed himself to deteriorate the way in which he was living the way he looked
1589690 he felt that if i ever in fact saw him i would never be able to represent him
1589691 a no good son of a bitch who robbed me blind
1589692 in 57 when i agreed to be his alter ego
1589693 i thought it would be very challenging representing him at presidential inaugurals handling multimillion dollar deals in his behalf in reality youre living a lie
1589694 those jobs in which the agency could not officially be involved
1589695 i was the fall guy caught between protecting the government and protecting the mob two armed camps that could crush me like a bug
1589696 most people i have observed spend 90 percent of their time scribbling notes and keeping records to justify their existence

1589698 the mp3 floating around on the message boards at the moment is a track we recorded with mike skinner a few months ago the track was the result of a late night jam session and something we did for a bit of a laugh featuring a blues riff we have been playing live recently upon which skinner recorded some vocals it is not intended to be a serious release so we are happy for it to be leaked around unofficially hope you enjoy cheers matt dom amp chris

1589703 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1589704 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time
1589705 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id see it basically the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it

1589716 ive never experienced a case of a murder more coldblooded than those that occurred in this case you decided you were going to annihilate those two people
1589717 weve got a drug epidemic everyone in the system is going to feel the pinch
1589718 we think that the programs we have initiated and our coming out of vietnam should enable us to turn the corner and bring this level of indiscipline down
1589719 i almost touched him he was a big hero of mine

1589723 dirty dealing drug smuggling on the mexican border and the assassination of a federal judge an american parable
1589724 they were these young hotshots on the border they called themselves scammers
1589725 it was nickel and dime stuff and then it began to escalate they flew cessnas and smuggled bluejeans quicksilver and people then it became marijuana and cocaine
1589726 ultimately we want to wake up each morning and know we are choosing what we do that day for us thats lightweight
1589727 when opportunity knocks its hard not to answer the problem is that we cant do it all and weve learned to say no even if it hurts sometimes

1589735 yeah right im not giving up this machine while im still winning
1589736 i heard there had been a meeting last friday at which they decided to close it and now its shut im obviously really concerned about the building because i remember when it was closed for years before the buddhists bought it my first fear was they were just going to leave at once but there was someone there when i went up
1589737 there were a number of people interested in turning it into a hotel or a computer centre before the buddhists bought it but as far as i understand there was a covenant placed on the building by the fielden family stipulating it must be used for educational purposes
1589738 we have just found out about it its early days and we will contact them formally about how they want to proceed
1589739 they have had a small development grant of around 10 000 or 15 000 to find out what needs doing the risk to the public purse is relatively small
1589740 but even though they have closed the centre it doesnt mean they have walked away from the building people are still there at the moment looking after it
1589741 the buddhists here have done a great job of renovating and redecorating the castle room by room over the years but theyve never had the capital to tackle the roof which is a huge problem
1589742 there have been times when ive tried to meditate and all i could hear was dripping water ive had to go up into the attic with a bucket to stop it dripping before i could continue
1589743 receiving the grant is wonderful for us it will mean that we can begin essential work to protect the fabric of this beautiful building for the benefit of generations of buddhist and non buddhist visitors alike without the help of english heritage and hlf this would not be possible

1589750 distributing objective scientific information albeit often preliminary to the public at large mmwr has filled that critical time gap between the immediacy of the news medias interpretation and the long wait for publication in the scientific journals
1589751 in fact cdc has published extra issues when health events of national importance required immediate scientific and objective reporting
1589752 as an impartial ensurer of the quality and integrity of the science
1589753 we were to make sure the report rests on scientifically sound data and make sure the information is translated in some kind of message of practical utility for the reading audience especially for state and local health officials
1589754 this is a national resource we are ready to respond on literally a moments notice
1589755 the public health community has not been very imaginative in promoting good reporting
1589756 reporting cases ought to be as much of a reflex as carrying a stethoscope and the names of serious offenders should be made public

1589770 i will use my presence here to convince those still in the bush to return home i will be the commissions ambassador
1589771 we were surprised when we received the information that some of these ex rebels were being kept by security agencies if you receive amnesty that means you are free if there are any other charges then they should be taken to court let this not confuse the public that when you get amnesty you get detained
1589772 to explore possibilities of adopting a common electoral platform for the 2011 general elections
1589773 today uganda is at crossroads of a possible happy return to genuine multiparty democracy and sustainable peace and development or a slide into anarchy and possible genocide
1589774 when persons connected to the highest office in the land are arrested on allegations of attempting to purchase chemical and biological weapons when citizens are abducted by state agents and held in illegal detention and rampant violation of human rights when diseases ravage the entire nation and when government stands helpless as to stop the carnage of school fires it is now imperative for political parties in this country to cooperate and rescue our country from sliding into a completely failed state
1589775 the country risks being plunged into political economic and social chaos

1589782 it is great news that gas has begun flowing from varanus island again and that the worst of the gas shortage is behind us

1589784 with housing affordability at a low interest rate concern at a high and the rental squeeze beginning to pinch it is intriguing to uncover the demographics and inclinations of todays first homebuyer to be
1589785 we know that many are increasingly determined to beat the affordability challenge and purchase their own piece of the country while others are becoming disheartened
1589786 every option whether it is saving more waiting longer making more sacrifices buying with others or something different should be considered before putting property purchase plans on hold
1589787 its a reality that in order to achieve the great australian dream of owning your own home sacrifices will be necessary
1589788 regardless it could be said that having to make sacrifices is a positive step because it helps people to understand the reality of a mortgage before they commit to one
1589789 we have learnt she is not participating after failing a dope test
1589790 i love my country but i needed to train at this moment

1589795 it hockey is a family sport i think thats the reason why you have a lot of brothers as all the family members play

1589803 it really looks like the track of edouard is heading right to that section
1589804 as long as we could have some good consistent rain that would really help us out this could be a wonderful thing if we do not receive high winds or flooding in the area
1589805 it is striking the difference of perspective between the united states and many other countries
1589806 i think because of the politics around immigration more broadly the fact that mr medellin is mexican rather than swedish does make a difference
1589807 it certainly does play into a bigger debate and bigger fears that many people have about immigration from mexico
1589808 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
1589809 that will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and bio fuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like off shore drilling clean coal and nuclear power like the power produced at this plant here in michigan

1589815 im paris hilton and i approved this message and i think its totally hot
1589816 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1589817 the players on the houston dynamo and the new england revolution have agreed in advance of last nights superliga final that they will split evenly the bonus money at stake in the game
1589818 the players have made this decision to show their solidarity and in protest of the leagues violation of the collective bargaining agreement with respect to the negotiation of bonuses for this tournament
1589819 well pay the winning team its share and the losing team its prize money
1589820 the prize money is as originally dictated by our owners
1589821 we thought it was fair and we continue to think it is appropriate
1589822 were at financial risk in this tournament and we need to manage that risk
1589823 if there was an mls cup final like that between the two teams id certainly root for that
1589824 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

1589861 i guess ive always been attracted to seeing someone flip a pizza in the air to stretch the dough

1589868 these results were known ages ago but they decided to release them just before the olympic games
1589869 there is a feeling that they officials did it especially to create unpleasantness for us
1589870 no one is excusing the athletes who broke the wada world anti doping agency code

1589874 the french championship in retrospect did me a lot of good it eased the pressure and showed the other french girls they could also swim at international level
1589875 it was hard on the day but it made me realise that i could be beaten and it was not the end of the world
