1650000 verily we used to call on him alone before verily he is al barr ar raheem
1650001 o man what has made you careless concerning your lord al kareem
1650002 and had it not been for the grace of allaah and his mercy on you allaah would have hastened the punishment and that allaah is raoof raheem
1650003 they say our lord let not our hearts deviate after you have guided us and grant us mercy from you truly you are al wahhaab
1650004 whoever can guarantee the chastity of what is between his two jaw bones and what is between his two legs his tongue and his private parts i guarantee paradise for him
1650005 o messenger of allaah will what we say be held against us
1650006 may your mother be bereaved of you muadh is there anything that topples people on their faces or he said on their noses into hell fire other than the jests of their tongues
1650007 there is nothing that is in more need of imprisonment than my tongue
1650008 be just to your ears as you are to your tongue you have been provided with two ears and only one tongue so that you may hear more than you speak
1650009 i have never seen anyone mindful of his tongue except that it had a good effect on the rest of his deeds and actions
1650010 part of someones being a good muslim is his leaving alone that which does not concern him
1650011 a servant of allaah may say a word because of which he may fall into the fire a distance that is more than what is between the east and the west
1650012 the most hated person in the sight of allaah is the most quarrelsome one
1650013 do not annoy the muslims nor seek out their faults for he who seeks out the faults of his fellow muslim will have his faults sought out by allaah and when allaah seeks out someones faults he exposes them even if he is in the interior of his house
1650014 to mention your brother in a manner which he dislikes
1650015 what if my brother actually has this failing that i made a mention of
1650016 if that failing is actually found in your brother you have in fact backbitten him and if that is not in him it is a slander
1650017 whoever has wronged his brother with regards his wealth or honour should ask for his pardon before his death before he pays for it in the hereafter when he will have neither a dinar nor a dirham he should secure pardon in this life before some of his good deeds are taken and paid to this his brother or if he has no good deeds some of the bad deeds of this his brother are taken to be loaded on him
1650018 i have been told that you said such and such evil words about me
1650019 a tale carrier ruins in an hour what a magician cannot ruin in a whole month
1650020 the worst amongst the people is the two faced one he comes to some people with one face and to others with another face
1650021 people will not stop asking questions until they say this is allaah the creator of everything then who created allaah
1650022 anyone in whose presence a muslim or a believer is backbitten and he defended him i e the one being backbitten than allaah will reward him with good in this life and in the next
1650023 o messenger of allaah we will walk you carry on riding
1650024 you are not stronger than me and i need the reward just as you need it and i am keen to gain that reward just as you are keen to gain that same reward
1650025 if you are truthful with allaah than allaah will be truthful with you
1650026 i am free from anyone who resides amongst the musrikeen
1650027 indeed in the messenger of allaah muhammad you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in the meeting with allaah and the last day and remembers allaah much
1650028 the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam admonished us to the extent that our hearts become touched by it and we were in tears until he narrated the hadeeth and he reached the part of it were he sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam said so stick to my sunnah and to the sunnah of the rightly guided khaalifs hold on to it and bite on to it with your molar teeth and be aware or keep away from newly invented matters as all the newly invented matters are innovation
1650029 and obey allaah and his messenger and do not dispute with one another lest you lose courage and your strength depart
1650030 and be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them it is they for whom there is an awful torment
1650031 do not differ amongst yourselves otherwise allaah will create difference amongst your hearts
1650032 nay man will be a witness against himself as his body parts skin hands legs etc will speak about his deeds

1650038 het helpt zeer veel wanneer wij in een vroeg stadium een blik kunnen werpen op de technische informatie over de bugs zelfs als wij de informatie pas n dag voor het uitbrengen van de patches ontvangen zal deze extra tijd al leiden tot een snellere release zelfs 24 uur geeft ons al een flinke voorsprong
1650039 yes that would be kosher because it has cloven hoofs chews its cud and has fins and scales although it would still be considered a meat meal even though its partially fish so you cant eat dairy with it
1650040 no absolutely not the snake and lobster parts make it treyf
1650041 no because hedgehogs arent kosher so a fairy hedgehog wouldnt be any different monkey
1650042 what if it was a dream devouring cow would the dream devouring disqualify it
1650043 bears have paws things with paws are not kosher and they eat meat
1650044 if it was a bear with hooves that chewed cud and the goblin part was just in its stomach would it be kosher
1650045 what if its just for show and they dont eat their prey
1650046 well im sure they dont chew their cud and have cloven hooves unless the chupacabra turns out to be some kind of mutant cow
1650047 unfortunately an owl is not kosher because it is a bird of prey lev 11 17 and obviously you cannot eat a man because that is cannibalism
1650048 a dolphin is a mammal just like you it has no scales even though it has fins besides what if it starts changing while youre eating it
1650049 it looked like a pile of dung it seemed to chew cud would any alien be automatically un kosher
1650050 i guess it really depends on the alien like a plant
1650051 what if they looked just like a cow but with a brain
1650052 but cows dont travel to other planets using their brains
1650053 no because the mule itself even if it werent fire breathing isnt kosher the fire doesnt cleanse it
1650054 unfortunately the horse part makes it treyf and a little bit of treyf makes everything treyf so if you had 99 percent fish and one percent horse it would still be treyf
1650055 that brings up a point theyre actually not sentient because theyre not real so arent they just as kosher as air
1650056 the snake and the lobster make it unkosher see hippocamp above for percentages
1650057 because although it chews the cud it does not have hooves
1650058 number one a vampire drinks blood blood ingesting is a no no number 2 baby
1650059 sure why not its not a food item scarf it down to your hearts delight so long as its made from plant fibers not a treyf animal and only one type of fiber no mixing of wool and linen
1650060 what if you marry one is that kosher will a rabbi marry you
1650061 if the mermaid is jewish the rabbi will probably marry you
1650062 no because you cannot eat anything that crawls on its belly
1650063 does that mean an injured kosher animal that is crawling along isnt kosher any more
1650064 yes because you cant eat an animal thats been injured or is sick
1650065 when you say cannibalistic do you mean a chicken that eats other chickens or a chicken that eats humans
1650066 when i say pollo maligno i have no idea what i mean except i sound fierce
1650067 well chickens are kosher but if its eating meat probably not
1650068 if its still undetermined it might be kosher but maybe not
1650069 only if they have fins and scales wait a they actually brine shrimp then no
1650070 i dont think so the package shows these cute little things with human faces
1650071 if you have to eat a demon you really ought to just go off and die somewhere
1650072 oh absolutely kosher vegetables are kosher and lambs are kosher nice combination how about some mint with that meal
1650073 no because you cannot eat anything that crawls on its belly
1650074 does that mean an injured kosher animal that is crawling along isnt kosher any more
1650075 yes because you cant eat an animal thats been injured or is sick
1650076 the following you shall abominate among the birds they shall not be eaten they are an abomination the eagle the vulture and the black vulture several treyf species of bird the stork herons of every variety the hoopoe and the bat
1650077 although it would still be considered a meat meal even though its partially fish
1650078 unfortunately the horse part makes it treyf and a little bit of treyf makes everything treyf so if you had 99 percent fish and one percent horse it would still be treyf
1650079 well i dont really know hashems shochet so yknow ill just have a piece of the fish
1650080 i vote that replicated pork is non kosher cause even though it didnt come from a living pig its suppose to be exactly like pig meat
1650081 i wonder if the fact im allergic to pork would carry over into replicated pork
1650082 in the st verse they probably have cures for food allergies
1650083 im just interacting with a machine and it interacts with other machines and im not responsible for anything
1650084 actually mwalts its dustin brooks who is the curious programmer who figured this out though i dont know why jeff doesnt link to the original source

1650086 this easy to use software also automates the process of adding comments on youtube if you plan on marketing on youtube you need this tool
1650087 if i had been one of those people in the in box id have wanted dustin to do exactly what he did
1650088 we dont store any private data and we want password recovery to be instant and easy
1650089 if i had been one of those people in the in box id have wanted dustin to do exactly what he did
1650090 you havent the foggiest fricking idea what he was actually doing with any of that information
1650091 if i had been one of those people in the in box id have wanted dustin to do exactly what he did stopping the leak should be first priority then catching the guy the chances of the latter and successfully prosecuting him her are unfortunately slim anyway
1650092 the fact is that if we considered those around us who we dont know as equal in worth to ourselves we would think twice be fore working on weapons and devices that we know will kill others
1650093 however as a computer scientist i stand firmly opposed to copyright and patent monopolies
1650094 i will educate myself and others on relevant laws regulations and policies regarding the performance of my duties
1650095 as an informed professional i will encourage the writing and adoption of relevant policies and laws consistent with the lopsa code of ethics
1650096 well look the source code is available everything must be on the up amp up
1650097 this is one reason that users should be entitled to examine the source code or otherwise reverse engineer analyse the workings of a piece of software without fear of legal backlash
1650098 there is an ethical imperative here that overrides any economic rebuttal

1650106 what has that got to do with the price of tea in china

1650108 what about working for a company like raytheon whose job is to build better killing machines would you consider that ethically defensible
1650109 this john terry seems to email pawel lesnikowski and adityasonphavde aditya rao i would not trust these people either
1650110 that s really bad and the problem is that only people like us who knows what reflector is realize of that kind of things and very often the law is short to punish this kinds of crimes

1650120 this is the last song i will ever sing no no ive changed my mind again goodnight and thank you
1650121 we are aware of reports of two british nationals being detained near the national stadium in beijing
1650122 we are in touch with the chinese authorities and are requesting immediate consular access should this information be correct
1650123 ill probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country but i believe its not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living under the occupation of the chinese government
1650124 for years the chinese government has tried to use the olympics to legitimise its illegal occupation of tibet
1650125 at this very moment tibetans are facing the most severe and violent repression they have seen in decades at the hands of the chinese government and we have taken non violent action at this critical time to draw the worlds attention to the crisis gripping tibet
1650126 im a long term tibet supporter and i feel that now is a really critical time for tibet
1650127 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool
1650128 they are whitewashing their human rights record on tibet so our action today shines a spotlight on those atrocities
1650129 in march tibetans took to the streets risking everything in their calls for justice and human rights and we stand today with this action in solidarity with those calls
1650130 they have been involved in tibetan issues for many years and iain knows many tibetans in the uk
1650131 for them this is a really important action to be part of and i know they were aware of the risks involved but they just felt it was very important to be there at this moment
1650132 it is opportunity to shine the spotlight on the chinese government and what is happening in tibet
1650133 the governments institutions are being used and clearly the decision was made under the personal directive of the prime minister
1650134 whether i am denied bail or not the campaign will continue
1650135 at this moment anwar has the upper hand in the campaign as everyone expects him to win
1650136 but the barisan ruling coalition strategy is to throw as much dirt as possible during the campaign so that even if he wins he will win with some tainted allegations
1650137 we believe that a transition of sorts has begun in malaysia but it is unclear how quickly things will change or even the degree of change that will take place
1650138 the governments institutions are being used and clearly the decision was made under the personal directive of the prime minister
1650139 whether i am denied bail or not the campaign will continue
1650140 at this moment anwar has the upper hand in the campaign as everyone expects him to win
1650141 but the barisan ruling coalition strategy is to throw as much dirt as possible during the campaign so that even if he wins he will win with some tainted allegations
1650142 we believe that a transition of sorts has begun in malaysia but it is unclear how quickly things will change or even the degree of change that will take place
1650143 as the chinese leadership prepares its display of grandeur and power in beijing it is waging a ruthless campaign of repression inside tibet
1650144 people will use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1650145 to those who are forced to go through forced abortions and have no voice we are your voice
1650146 we dont have the same rights as in america and other countries
1650147 we believe that execution by way of a gunfire is inhumane it is for these reasons that the defence attorneys are applying to challenge the legislation
1650148 its not a matter for us whether or not amrozi is to be executed gunfire is one way another way of doing it is by lethal injection
1650149 we believe that is still more humane than by a gunfire
1650150 we must not bring our countries to war just because of disputes on our border
1650151 we need to stay together as good neighbours for tens of thousands of years to come we need to narrow our disputes and maximize bilateral cooperation including trade

1650179 breakfast as the word suggests literally means breaking the fast after 10 12 hours without food our blood sugar is low and our body needs fuel which is why many nutritionists consider breakfast to be the most important meal of the day a good healthy breakfast will set you up for the rest of the day in fact studies show that what you eat at breakfast can affect your mood your physical and mental performance as well as your weight and long term health
1650180 trying to get your brain fired up in the morning without a proper breakfast is like trying to run your car without petrol a paper published in the american journal of clinical nutrition which combined the findings of a number of different studies on the breakfast habits of children revealed that those who did not have breakfast in the morning performed less well in problem solving tasks verbal fluency creativity and the ability to recall newly acquired facts were similarly affected but it isnt just children that perform less well if they skip breakfast other studies found that adults who ate breakfast tended to work faster made fewer mistakes in logic tests and had better memory recall compared with breakfast skippers glucose is the brains only fuel and it is also vital for the manufacture of neurotransmitter acetylcholine which is important for memory after fasting overnight blood glucose levels are at a low ebb which may explain why people who dont refuel with breakfast have difficulty concentrating and perform less well in the morning
1650181 to keep blood sugar even the single best carbohydrate food is oats
1650182 for example having wheat free oatcakes is four times better than bread for balancing blood sugar levels keeping your blood sugar evenly balanced not only determines your weight it is also the key to high energy stable mood concentration and longevity

1650189 we have in place measures to increase the effectiveness of the eradication of traffic in persons and have enhanced the effectiveness of law enforcement agents to suppress the crime of human trafficking
1650190 to know what you will really do you have to be in power first my recent experience is the case in point we had a manifesto talking about education housing healthcare good roads and reducing unemployment but it happens that these are the things that the pdp government is currently doing may be not the same face that we will like it to have but fortunately the outcome is matching our vision and since we are not in power yet we are not sure of what our gubernatorial candidate can do but right now the government in power is doing a lot of the things that we wanted to do even if the methodology is different of course they are doing what we said we will like to do when we get into power
1650191 the fact that i am a member of the opposition should not blind me to the realities on ground are we to remain in a perpetual state of confrontation at the expense of the society to assess a government fairly you have to consider it with something not in isolation
1650192 now according to published reports the banks have asked to be allowed to take over nitel as the new owners at a time the government is pursuing a fresh privatisation arrangement for the much bastardised telecommunications firm this is sad
1650193 if it is found out that there is complicity between the bpe and the powers that be then to sell nitel to transcorp at all cost including undermining due process then the leadership of the bureau must be made to answer for such lapses
1650194 also worthy of unravelling is the role of the director general of the nigerian stock exchange dr ndidi okereke onyuike in the whole privatisation mess considering her dual role as the chief executive of the nse and a key official of transcorp
1650195 your new status as bonafide citizens of nigeria confers on you the fundamental rights priviledges and immunities as guaranteed by the constitution however it shall be exercised or enjoyed within the confines of the laws of the state similarly the conferment also expects from you responsibilities and obligations to the state

1650215 if you notice of late they have been writing all sorts of false stories and abusing me and my family in the pages of newspapers they have called me all sorts of names accusing me of even things i know nothing about
1650216 and since they are hurt by the responses and reactions their writings have attracted from my admirers and some well meaning citizens of our state they are now embarrassed and want to eliminate me

1650218 we have not appreciated the place of teachers in our society
1650219 people talk of parents sending their children to school abroad this is what you get when you refuse to assess how healthy your educational system is from time to time it did not start today gradually the value degenerates and no one seems to care about it i appeal to whoever is in charge of the situation to see it as a duty to return the teachers to school

1650224 the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta mend condemns the wanton destruction of lives and property in the impoverished ijaw community of agge by the cowardly men of the military joint task force on august 4 2008

1650241 in einem schwierigen wirtschaftlichen umfeld das weiterhin durch stark steigende rohstoffpreise und einen schwachen dollar gekennzeichnet war erreichten wir ein sehr erfreuliches organisches umsatzwachstum
1650242 das organische wachstum 6 1 wurde von allen unternehmensbereichen getragen es stammt insbesondere aus unseren wachstumsregionen w hrend die entwicklung in westeuropa verhalten war
1650243 die entt uschend ausgefallenen auftragseing nge der deutschen industrie h tten die anleihen gest tzt

1650245 in der zeitplanung f r die kabinettsthemen sind ein kernenergienutzungsgesetz oder eckpunkte dar ber f r eine kabinettsbefassung nicht vorgesehen
1650246 was eine neue bundesregierung sich nach der bundestagswahl 2009 vornimmt verm gen wir heute nicht zu beurteilen
1650247 dieser baustein wird teil des gesamten konzeptes sein an dem im moment bis zum herbst noch gearbeitet wird
1650248 the festival is bigger than ever this year because we have more partners each time who want to be part of it

1650250 so the community are starting to engage and were very keen to do that so that it doesnt become something thats imported and landed on the community
1650251 as well as having interesting visiting artists its also about celebrating whats here by people who worked in the industry its got to have that stuff coming in from above and stuff coming in from below
1650252 we had a really good jury led by will farmer of fielding auctioneers who appears on antiques roadshow he does the auction for us each year and the amount of glass that goes through his auction house is increasing all the time
1650253 the prize money has gone up this year and for the first time we have a student element in the biennale there was fierce competition among students to be one of the 11 chosen although the number of courses has declined the quality of work coming out of colleges at the moment is really interesting

1650255 this is a huge vote of confidence in the progress weve made in the west midlands this year
1650256 the prime minister pioneered a new regional politics with the appointment of regional ministers last summer now we have the first cabinet held in the regions it gives us a chance to put our plans for new jobs and new homes centre stage
1650257 we have a huge amount to showcase like plans for a new new street station the best performing apprenticeship programme in britain new plans for science investment like channel 4s 50 million digital media fund billions of investment pouring into redevelopment and ambitions for a new home to be built every half an hour

1650261 the very vegetable painting competition is a great way of getting kids to think about veg in a different way especially as there are so many who refuse to eat fresh produce but if we can inspire them to paint a picture using broccoli as a tree or the steam from a train then who knows we might inspire them to grow their own and learn to love the tastes of autumn
1650262 we are delighted to be involved with the very vegetable painting competition
1650263 its an excellent opportunity for us to plant the seed about saving teaching children that through growing their own veg they can save their parents some money and hopefully earn some extra pocket money as a result
1650264 our customers asked for in flight connectivity and we respond by deploying the largest wi fi network in the sky
1650265 is het rekruteren van kinderen en het rekruteren om te vechten voor twijfelachtige oorlogen voor jullie en de mensen die voor jullie werken de juiste manier van zaken doen
1650266 we hebben veel te leren van hun succes ze hebben een aantal erg innovatieve dingen gedaan die de mensen bezig hield en hun experience rating systeem is iets waar we interesse in hebben
1650267 we hebben de tijdslimiet bereikt waarin we een oplossing konden vinden voor het openhouden van de fury servers jammer genoeg hebben we geen oplossing gevonden waardoor we geen andere mogelijkheid zien dan binnen 48 uur de servers te sluiten
1650268 if i do not play at my age that becomes annoying for the progression of my career
1650269 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england
1650270 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1650271 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1650272 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted ok but now i need to start performing properly
1650273 the way he goes past players it doesnt look like hes running fast but he is hes a real box to box player
1650274 he has a similar type of attitude to leon osman he likes to get forward and against forest and preston he should have scored he looks like he has got a goal in him
1650275 were probably one or two quality players short on the frontline but were not going to be held to ransom either by a player or a club
1650276 everyone is looking for goalscorers at this time of year its a nervy time for every manager all you can do is to keep calm and keep doing your homework
1650277 its not a bottomless pit of money that weve got available and we believe every player has a valuation
1650278 i dont want to leave and i havent been told anything that would make me think i would be leaving its all rubbish and rumours
1650279 people ring you up and say youve been linked here and there but unless it comes from the manager you learn to just block it out
1650280 he is one of the managers major targets david said last week in america i am only going to bring in players who will take the club forward and that is how he is
1650281 he is relentless in that i have never known david say hell do or thatll do he takes his time pinpoints and focuses and when i actually see the player he has focused on i say i get it i saw one this weekend on a football pitch and i said yeah i see why we want that particular player
1650282 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1650283 it was another good work out it was a good game with four goals for us and good play
1650284 but the players arent 100 yet that would be difficult right now
1650285 pian piano il costo delle candeline comincia ad avvicinare quello della torta

1650289 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1650290 the dopest dope ive ever smoked its like gods vagina

1650301 we have gone from the sublime to the ridiculous in going from a final to losing in the qualifying stage
1650302 but it has happened it is thoroughly disappointing but if we had gone through we could have counted ourselves fortunate because our level of performance was nowhere near what it reached last season
1650303 its a blow in every aspect including the financial side and everything that comes with it
1650304 we still have to change the squad but there will be an impact on the budget
1650305 we have been looking to bring in at least one maybe two midfield players
1650306 but we have to wait and see what transpires when we take into account the ramifications of not having european football
1650307 if the benefit of european football is that you get champions league money to spend then of course when you dont have it we will have to be careful with what we do

1650402 theyve got bags of ambition and who is to say they cant be up there again challenging the best
1650403 back in the 60s brian snape had a grand vision for the club he brought in the likes of mike coulman chris hesketh keith fielding and myself and we challenged the best and they were wonderful times
1650404 brian snape was a very difficult act for chairman john wilkinson to follow but he has also proved to be a fine ambassador and has done a great job
1650405 john is what i would term a crusading chairman i like him a lot i respect him and i know hes desperately keen to see salford be up there with the best
1650406 john has experienced many ups and downs in his time at the willows but hes continued to be a magnificent supporter and backer of the club
1650407 he must now realise there is an opportunity for dreams to become reality for their elevation back to super league represents a great opportunity for salford the game has moved on and in shaun mcrae they have a very experienced coach with a good reputation
1650408 they are now in a position to progress so who knows what might happen im hoping things work out well for them

1650464 it takes someone of dr enroths stature and scholarship as one of the most respected and recognized experts on american religious movements to take the reader through the experiences of individuals couples and families from their first meetings with the various churches that will abuse them spiritually psychologically and financially and to let the reader see the inner state such abuse produces this is the most sophisticated in depth presentation yet made of the psychological and spiritual consequences of what various pastoral and church group abuse produce not only of value to the religious community it will be of great use to psychiatrists psychologists social workers physicians and academicians this is a book for those helping and those needing help timely authoritative and valuable gripping reading
1650465 churches that abuse is a book which the christian church has long been waiting for a well documented and invaluable exposure of spiritual abuses resulting from power hungry leaders who use guilt fear and intimidation to control their churches this is a most essential tool for the discernment so much needed today
1650466 a much needed and singular volume of case studies related to churches which abuse their members having collected the testimonies of numerous persons who have departed from such abusive churches enroth has woven this material into a larger tapestry of interpretation of the characteristics and methods of abusive churches this he has done with professional skill and pastoral concern
1650467 we have been waiting a long time for such a book it is a landmark event in this field and will be of immense value to former members of abusive groups their families and helping professionals
1650468 a timely work enroth shows not only the individual crises suffered by abused believers but the challenges these churches pose for the whole of christianity a very sobering and thought provoking effort
1650469 enroth demonstrates convincingly that authoritarian preachers who twist scripture and pass themselves off as spirit filled men seldom women of god unconscionably exploit the trust of sincere and credulous believers for their own selfish benefit we can benefit much from this timely informative and helpful treatment of the problem
1650470 in story after chilling story enroth reveals how authoritarian fringe churches mislead their flocks and inflict hard perhaps this book will prevent more potential victims from being ensnared by religions outlaws
1650471 those who make it hardest to be a christian in this world are the other christians
1650472 he called me with his bull horn to come to the spectator stands immediately he was extremely angry and asked me why i had disobeyed him about the substitutions pointing out that the assistant pastor was still in the game without any provocation on my part phil was attempting to intimidate me publicly before many people i was stunned his outrage continued for the rest of the evening as he attacked me and the team members
1650473 i pointed out that i had always done what he had asked in regard to coaching any teams and that his sudden outburst of rage toward me was totally uncalled for his only response was that i did not obey him and therefore was not submissive to him
1650474 i want to welcome you to set free christian fellowship a place where people who love jesus come a place where people who dont know jesus come a place where people who want to find out about jesus come and its the place too where a few troublemakers come just to try to stir up trouble i would point out a few of them right now but i wont well let god take care of them amen
1650475 jesus christ can make you fly jesus christ can totally set you free this morning
1650476 im gonna dedicate this in prayer for mick jagger that he get saved he might be able to sing here at set free one of these days
1650477 instead of us getting together to try to work out our problems we got separated
1650478 when you first start to get involved youre so naive about things and its really easy to fall into becoming part of pastor phils clique especially when youre just coming off of drugs and having a lot of problems
1650479 at the time tina and i were new christians who didnt know very much about the lord and we could have followed any kind of cult without even knowing it there are a lot of people out there who twist the word around and there are a lot of false prophets
1650480 there were a lot of things phil kept me from doing and at the time i thought it was okay but i just couldnt see what he was doing i thought what he was doing was good for my life and i didnt realize how bad it is to keep someone away from her family or to keep grandchildren from seeing their grandparents
1650481 i never questioned divorce and remarriage because i thought phil knew what he was doing and everything was okay
1650482 because i had made phil my god i couldnt understand how a pastor could allow these things to happen i couldnt understand how phil could allow my husband to be lifted up again right after he had just ripped off his wife and had been shooting up drugs for two days i was pregnant at the time and i had to have all my utilities turned off because he had stolen all my money and i wasnt able to pay our bills
1650483 the whole emphasis at set free is the idea that everybody should live in one community however at that particular point my wife and i had just sold our house and had begun living in an apartment phil was constantly pressuring us to break our lease on the apartment and move into the set free homes at that time they had twelve homes that housed about two hundred people he said if i would move in i wouldnt have the responsibility of having to raise any more support or have to work a part time job in order to pay my bills and i could be there twenty four hours a day ministering and having the freedom to do what god called me to do he also pointed out that if i ever had to leave town for any reason my wife would have people to fellowship with we became convinced that it was the right thing to do my wife and i took that as being wisdom from the lord and from our pastor so we broke our lease and moved into the homes we also sold most of our possessions and thinking that we would be there for the rest of our lives we took our remaining possessions and remodeled the home which we moved into we gave them all of our furniture our refrigerator and a variety of household goods
1650484 from the outside everything seemed to be exactly what i was looking for
1650485 he was very lively and full of enthusiasm he was very non traditional an ex gang member ex drug addict ex con a harley davidson biker who wore all black always wore his dark ray ban sunglasses without taking them off had tattoos all over his body and was of mexican descent
1650486 things were perfect and we thought we had found the place that the lord had told us to go and spend the rest of our lives
1650487 the only thing worse than an old christian was an educated christian
1650488 supposed to treat her husband as if he were the lord
1650489 he continually goes off and does whatever he wants which usually doesnt include stacee
1650490 i finally got to the point where i was about to lose my wife and child kerry was being tormented psychologically and was increasingly negatively affected by the ministry
1650491 i told him that he didnt have to help us his response was that the sooner he got us out of there the better after we had loaded everything he began to verbally attack me hoping to get me to physically attack him he began to discredit me by calling me a spineless wimp and a baby he said that i was sowing discord in the ministry and causing other people to leave when i responded using scripture he didnt answer but continued to belittle me in front of my wife and all the people in the homes i am sure he was trying to provoke me to anger so that i would physically attack him that would prove to all the observers that i was indeed an outlaw which is set free jargon for a backslider or a rebellious person
1650492 i told him that i was just visiting and then he told me that i better leave right away he again said that i was trying to sow discord he called me a loser and a spineless wimp he proceeded to inform me how god wasnt doing anything with my life and how miserable i was he said that my family life was down the tubes and that was the reason i was back in town after a few more minutes of his verbal abuse phils secretary lois joined in and began to tell me that i was treading on dangerous ground she said that if i continued to act that way toward phil god would probably take my life because i was messing with a man who was anointed by god
1650493 he started to pat me on the head and make some kissing gestures at me
1650494 phil aguilar is a very confused individual who is selfish chauvinistic prideful jealous arrogant and extremely authoritarian he will do anything to advance his organization his ministry or his business
1650495 to approach certain lives not to pin them down not to confine them with labels not to limit them with heavily intellectualized speculations but to approach to describe to transmit as directly and sensibly as possible what has been seen heard grasped felt
1650496 stop let me tell you the rest of the story
1650497 some observations and considerations keep coming up over and over again until they seem to have the ring of truth to them i do not know how that ring will sound to others but its sound after a while gets to be distinct and unforgettable to me
1650498 i must write it all out at any cost writing is thinking it is more than living for it is being conscious of living
1650499 you go right up there and tell him off go ahead ill hold your monkey for you
1650500 wow that is the most thoughtful and touching thing i have ever seen you truly are a kind man

1650503 christianity is opposed to war in the sense that if men and nations universally behaved as christians wars would cease the ideal of the kingdom of god involves the reign upon earth of universal peace war is therefore in itself an unchristian thing it is moreover a barbarous and irrational method of determining disputes since the factors which humanly speaking are decisive for success in war viz the organized and unflinching use of superior physical force are in principle irrelevant to the rights or wrongs of the cause which may be at stake the victories of might and right do not invariably coincide

1650520 what is life is life those scattered moments of joy or the shit that you have to wade through like this well obviously its this because after all those scattered moments of joy are indeed scattered
1650521 but it is precisely the time at no time like this is it any more evident that life is shit
1650522 youre right actually because what i came here to tell you is that youre going about this all wrong dont try to shirk the shit youll only wind up deeper in it than ever an emotional quicksand embrace the shit embrace suffering at that point it can be used as common ground common ground between you i and everyone who is all fucking hurting but too afraid to admit it too afraid because theyre watching themselves sink deeper into the hurt
1650523 youd better shut the fuck up before i jam a knife in your eye
1650524 yes yes yes thats exactly it from suffering comes anger and rage and from anger and rage comes rebellion
1650525 think of all the hate youve built and bottled up darius think of faces twisted distorted disgusting faces grotesque gruesome vicious faces every person who had a part in sending porter away every single one think of the faces shit if you need to get some paper and draw their faces as you see them for what they really are then take out a thick black marker and
1650526 you dont understand we did it for porter he needs help
1650527 i wonder what you would look like on fire perhaps something like this
1650528 what in the name of the people are you trying to do

1650547 thats part of the whole situation now in theory they could sell world in conflict separately from massive i think that any buyer would like to make sure it goes together but we dont own it activision owns it so thats their call
1650548 i think that right now everyone is in wait and see mode and just want to know what the future holds
1650549 but massive has been in tough situations before in the past 12 years and weve always come out stronger most of the guys in the company at least have faith in our ability to find a really interesting future

1650564 the selections on the night gave us the right options to be able to attack the new zealanders where we wanted to
1650565 unfortunately we werent accurate in the lineout play and that compromised us
1650566 its one of those things you can pick a taller lineout but irrespective of who you pick you have to be accurate in your skill
1650567 i thought the first two matches we met those physical challenges last week against new zealand we probably didnt
1650568 theres no denying it was a performance that wasnt good but i think the signs generally have been there
1650569 theres a lot of excitement about whats happening at the moment and they will be busting to get back into it to put that performance behind them
1650570 it was a little out of character and we will be doing our best to rectify that
1650571 robert stands equal with the greatest midfielders in the game he has stood the test of time
1650572 roberts still playing a high standard of football hes probably in our top six in the best and fairest this year
1650573 but you dont want to push things until they break hes in a position to go out on his own terms playing good football
1650574 someone that consistently gave their best at training and in games
1650575 training was always important to me to be seen as a good trainer
1650576 im very happy and honoured to have stretched my career out for as long as i did
1650577 its the right time for the club its the right time for myself ive had a great run
1650578 id like to stay in football you cant get away from the fact im going to miss footy dob 21 8 71
1650579 provided he doesnt trip over a pothole or something like that hes pulled up fine and he moved well
1650580 its been a pretty cautious approach for gaz i think perhaps in years gone by you might have rushed a player back say last week but hes just making sure hes ticked all the boxes
1650581 garys form up until he got injured was as good as ive ever seen
1650582 probably since hes been injured jimmys form has been as good as garys was so it would be nice to sit there on brownlow night and see one of the boys win it
1650583 but theres so many good players out there and thats a really tough one
1650584 last year there was a whole lot of expectation and the unknown was really exciting and it was new it was fresh all those sorts of things
1650585 a lot of anxiety crept in about this time of year we were probably a bit gung ho to get towards the finals
1650586 our form not necessarily dropped off but fluctuated probably plateaued a little bit
1650587 this year im not thinking about winning a premiership like i was last year as such so its more of a level headed approach

1650592 i used it a few times at the race track getting home a horse
1650593 i had a really tough session on monday and got through it really well and have pulled up fine today so i think thats a good sign and the physio and the doctor are happy so ill take the field gasnier said
1650594 the tigers have already said how desperate they are so i think its going to have a feel of semi final football out there he said get the best of foxtel
1650595 they still havent made a decision on pakistan so until that time comes well see what happens

1650598 we continue to receive a stream of credible reports indicating terrorists are in the advanced stages of planning attacks these attacks could target western or australian interests and individuals and places frequented by foreigners and could occur at any time attacks may be launched anywhere in pakistan including major cities
1650599 we want to go over and play in safety we want to make sure that were safe when were playing in any country so its not just pakistan its any country
1650600 as long as were safe and weve been guaranteed that all the security measures are right and so and so then theres no reason why we cant go
1650601 i think maybe sonny might not have that long in the game with the injuries he had maybe he thinks he does not have much longer in the game and needs to get out of it what he can
1650602 its getting to the point where its getting quite embarrassing
1650603 we need to show plenty of heart this week and get some pride back in the jersey because at the moment were just embarrassing ourselves and the club
1650604 you can come up with thousands of excuses about why were going bad but at the end of the day theres not one player thats going to stop us from getting 40 points put past us
1650605 once we get behind on the scoreboard the heads are just going down at the moment and the excuses come out so weve just spoken about getting rid of that and turning things around
1650606 weve been saying that every week but weve got to do it now

1650630 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1650631 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1650632 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1650633 they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee

1650703 the artist makes an application and sends in a sample of their work whether it be on a slide or cd
1650704 then a jury of their peers looks at all the art work and decides who gets accepted there are three different scenarios possible someone may be chosen automatically others may have to bring in samples of their work for a view day and then we go through the process again to determine whether that person has the ability to be in the show finally some people are just automatically rejected
1650705 people who were in the show before dont have to go through the application process
1650706 a large number were invited back this year but i think we have twenty five newcomers that were chosen out of about 100 applications

1650711 even if it seems the cats do generally get along you may be fooled concerning their relationship with one another
1650712 most spraying as you describe is secondary to stress among the cats
1650713 litter hygiene could be part of the problem the rule is a litter box for each cat plus one scoop daily and periodically toss out the litter all together uncovered boxes in general are best
1650714 feliway a knockoff of a cats calming pheromone found on their cheek pads really does work to help cut down on spraying
1650715 create various high places in rooms the cats frequent even cardboard boxes shoeboxes or cat sacks are a good idea
1650716 since cat food has certain essential amino acids and a balance of vitamins and nutrients specific for cats over the long haul its a problem for a cat to eat dog food but certainly a few pieces of kibble here and there is no problem im more concerned that your cat is choosing the dog food because he really isnt enjoying his prescription diet please speak to you veterinarian about this problem because its likely you can transition to another prescription diet and see if your cat enjoys that food more we all know individual cats all have their own preferences
1650717 no cat is being vindictive here when cats defecate on the bed its for one or a combination of reasons the place is high and safe where one cat can view another and or this soft place like an elevated litter box even smells like you
1650718 but as scary as the situation is fortunately thank god nobody was hurt it shows that the airlines were able to handle these things in an effective way

1650741 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1650742 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
1650743 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
1650744 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
1650745 provided he doesnt trip over a pothole or something like that hes pulled up fine and he moved well
1650746 its been a pretty cautious approach for gaz i think perhaps in years gone by you might have rushed a player back say last week but hes just making sure hes ticked all the boxes
1650747 garys form up until he got injured was as good as ive ever seen

1650758 it was all rather chaotic there was a long line at the two entrances for a while both lines were moving but ours suddenly stopped and we were told we couldnt get in
1650759 so we moved to the other line they let a few more people through that one but then the girl at the door said she couldnt allow any one else in because it would be a fire hazard
1650760 there were about 10 or 15 of us all with tickets and young children who couldnt get in
1650761 every one left outside were really angry about the total lack of organisation
1650762 we were offered our money back or alternative dates for the show however the majority of us had already travelled to the venue with very small children struggled down the very steep and un parent child friendly steps waited for over 30 minutes to be told at the last minute that there was no more room in the theatre try explaining that to a two year old
1650763 the lady in front of me had taken time off work especially to go to the show for her daughters 2nd birthday there were many angry parents and hysterical children

1650776 kind of at this point pretty much everything is on the table
1650777 what are savings for if not to use when times get tough
1650778 for now we are working on xbox 360 with microsoft but i dont know beyond that
1650779 theres definitely a new energy in the company and i think thats exactly what the intention was
1650780 they did some very innovative things to keep people going and their experience rewards system was something that we paid a lot of attention to
1650781 attention les filles florence est une ville tr s on reuse
1650782 research documentation and procedural issues were detected at the medical center inlittle rock by va employees and an aggressive action plan has been developed and is being implemented addressing
1650783 it seems like we have plenty of options weve had some good meetings here
1650784 being a part of a merger like this is a strange situation because obviously the new organisation has to look over all of its assets everything it owns and its strategy for the future
1650785 apparently they didnt want an rts studio in europe and to be honest we would have loved to have worked with activision but were pretty confident in our capabilities and there are not many studios that can match our quality
1650786 thats part of the whole situation now in theory they could sell world in conflict separately from massive i think that any buyer would like to make sure it goes together but we dont own it activision owns it so thats their call
1650787 right now we have over 12 million users in over 26 countries with 240 million in transactions revenue so far with 180 million in the last 12 months alone
1650788 on average titles that have downloadable content on xbl marketplace have seen a 16 percent period of people holding onto that title which keeps them from selling to secondhand stores

1650793 i just know in my heart im not going to be here next year but not being a big enough man coming to tell me new management must not understand what kind of character i have
1650794 first of all nascar from an officiating point of view did a great job
1650795 it turned out to be a great tire that was extraordinarily durable
1650796 the toyota tundra 200 nascar craftsman truck series race is such a fun and exciting experience for our 5 000 toyota team members that we wanted to share the day with folks that may not usually have a chance to attend a race
1650797 my goal is to win because we should have won the first race
1650798 i could not see anything and the radio was not working
1650799 regardless i am very satisfied with my race because i kept the car on the track until the end and i was able to keep up with the leaders for a good part of the race

1650802 information has come to light that you may be inadmissible to the united states
1650803 we really have to scrub it and are now going to take a good look to see if it holds
1650804 it has a role in defining what we think of as a natural it helps to map out who we think we are
1650805 to look at the media effect and influence there is an underlying need to define influence as we understand it in relation to society and its overall effect
1650806 the internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it

1650832 quasi mystical faith in beats as somehow figurative a belief that the tremors that each breakthrough by auteur producer or scenius alike sent through the state of pop somehow correlated with or could be equated to tremors through society after a good decade at full tilt that particular structure of affect and belief has faded away for me now or for now something could bring it back possibly but what that would be i cant even begin to imagine beats are just beats again cool funky useful invigorating inventive

1650834 well hannes we arent really sure why the dinosaurs are extinct
1650835 of course we know its because of this meteor that hit the earth and then everything was covered in a what is it called phosphorus gas yes definetly that paleontologists found this out
1650836 even if a licensee lives upstairs it is still classed as a business
1650837 businesses tend to have more experience and knowledge of risk management techniques
1650838 i am extremely disappointed those affected not only had their business destroyed but their homes too surely that should qualify them
1650839 the government is right to recognise pubs as households for council tax but when it comes to handing out money they dont want to know
1650840 everybody who lives on a flood plain is susceptible to flooding businesses are no better prepared than households the government should tackle the issue case by case
1650841 just the very thought of a rent review can incite fear in the eyes of a licensee if youre not properly prepared they can be a very stressful experience
1650842 we aim to distill some of the myths surrounding rent reviews encourage positive communication between licensees and pubcos and assist the process to be as straightforward as possible
1650843 lets get one thing clear the mydols dont take any lip
1650844 the security agents of the basep the presidential security battalion came to our home around 9 20 09 20 gmt and took away my father
1650845 we are in contact with our embassy in mauritania to obtain confirmation of the events that appear to be taking place in nouakchott
1650846 based on initial information it seems that a group of generals are holding the prime minister

1650850 uk pension schemes of ftse 100 companies enjoyed a brief period of surplus until early in 2008
1650851 some companies chose to spend their surpluses on various forms of de risking activity including buy out purchasing financial swaps and reducing their exposure to equities
1650852 events of the last year demonstrate the importance of assessing and managing pension risks and being prepared to take opportunities when they present themselves
1650853 it is inevitable that employers will keep on closing schemes to both new and existing members especially in the face of so much uncertainty around funding and costs
1650854 this is the final chapter final salary pensions promise will soon be a thing of the past for private sector workers
1650855 oh crap everyone is leaving the game because its boring and there is no new content what shall we do i know make people recruit their friends
1650856 this is the epitome of a win win arrangement and an ideal public private partnership
1650857 the growth weve seen in the last year and the fact that theres a lot more to come mean were looking to strengthen our focus on our people and service which is why weve embarked on the search for a new people focussed operations director
1650858 we know that the only way to perform in this market is to have great people and to retain and develop them so that they grow with the business
1650859 weve ramped up our pace of development in the last year whilst keeping our individualism and quality
1650860 since last year i have been contacted by a number of licensees asking about spikeys
1650861 whilst it would appear that the deliberate contamination of drinks is not widespread in bamber bridge we are supplying the spikeys for members of our community to use both here and when they travel further a field to places like preston blackpool and other larger towns and cities in the area
1650862 the fact that licensees have approached us and put their support behind this initiative is pleasing and illustrates the excellent working relationship we have which builds on the successful pubwatch scheme

1650867 another look at rpgs this time from an isometric view
1650868 for a while theres been some talk about who i am but its not a big deal i wanted to be unknown because i just want it to be all about the tunes
1650869 over the last year the unknown thing become an issue so im not into it any more
1650870 im a low key person and i just want to make some tunes nothing else my names will bevan im from south london im keeping my head down and just going to finish my next album theres going to be a 12 inch maybe in the next few weeks too with four tunes

1650875 you just look like a musician do you play anything
1650876 if i wanted to i could go that route and be respected not for my success respected for my music and my lyrics or whatever
1650877 thats why i did the mixtape that i did i did a mixtape called teen of the south with dj scream and i did that just to step my game up a little bit on that lyrical side but i wasnt really going into no album and just full fledge trying to switch my swagger and try to get respect from the game
1650878 cause why would i show love to the game the game dont show you love back so i wasnt gonna do that and come back out and mess up my image and mess up myself i was going on the strength that i want respect from people who probably dont like me anyway so im gonna stick to what i do and stay being successful and ill do some mixtapes and some futures something like that

1650891 i send my prayers and good wishes for the success of this event
1650892 right from the time of chinas application to hold the olympic games i have supported chinas right to host the games
1650893 this is a moment of great pride to the 1 3 billion chinese people
1650894 these games should contribute to promoting the olympic spirit of friendship openness and peace
1650895 i personally told my chinese counterparts very candidly that if the talks do not make any tangible results there is no point in wasting each others time

1650913 there is scarcely anything in the world that some man cannot make a little worse and sell a little more cheaply the person who buys on price alone is this mans lawful prey
1650914 with passersby who i pine over for years for instance and god forbid i actually kiss someone or for that matter end up in bed with them or love them i mean i do love them all but those are soo significant well theyre more like near life experiences frankly
1650915 look i understand what youre saying i get that youre passionate about everyone but whos going to be the one youre sooo passionate about that you stop being soo passionate about everyone else that they ruin your relationships
1650916 oh youre missing my point darling my relationships dont get ruined they just return to being the passerby who i pine over i pull em out of the crowd and eventually its just the natural order of things that they be returned from whence they came and doublelikewise for me i mean this is who i was when we found one another it keeps me vibrant
1650917 i think that once youve gone through the entire crowd though youll realise that they all have grown to hate you and sweetheart they are talking to each other
1650918 in the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for in our extended package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive
1650919 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps
1650920 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1650921 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1650922 the german government believes it is important to maintain the unity between the eu3 germany france and britain plus 3 united states china and russia and that this unity is an important recipe for the success of our policy towards iran

1650927 none of us can predict which way it will go let alone how quickly things will happen but that isnt a reason to sit on the sidelines and wait
1650928 this games gonna go down to the wire isnt it
1650929 i felt like it was the best place for me and there was really no reason to wait
1650930 i mean ross browner and alan page are you kidding me
1650931 i feel very fortunate when you read the names of the folks who are in there let alone the folks who are not in there
1650932 hes really one of the brightest best thinkers ive ever had the pleasure of working with
1650933 and at the same time hes so innovative it will be very interesting to have him bring that combination to an ad position i think hell establish a new standard for the hiring of athletic directors in collegiate sports
1650934 someday in the future notre dame will celebrate this day as a real turning point in their athletic program
1650935 under the most conservative terms this is a billion dollars of total revenue for the state and city
1650936 and certainly out of a billion dollars we wont have trouble finding funds to line up our end of the bargain
1650937 he has the ability to draw common sense out of very complex problems and make everybody see the benefits at the end of the day
1650938 there were so many components to this jack had the incredible ability to work all those constituencies and make them understand
1650939 when the athletes paraded down the mall you could almost feel a sense of wow we pulled it off
1650940 we knew it was our chance to stick our foot in the water we couldnt blow it
1650941 it reinforced the message that the stadium was a community need
1650942 this is a franchise that we own as a community
1650943 for all the brilliance of the people who started this no one could foresee this kind of growth
1650944 the opportunity to catch our breath is about over and we want to make sure all the pieces of the platform are in place said jack swarbrick who will leave his position after eight years as chairman of the board of the sports corp
1650945 at its most recent convention the ncaa agreed to create a joint ncaa usoc task force to study the status of olympic sports programs at ncaa institutions and develop recommendations designed to protect and expand future opportunities for american athletes and coaches
1650946 the ncaa usoc task force is being chaired by jack swarbrick and there could not have been a better choice while you may not have heard his name before be assured that mr swarbrick is a major player he was instrumental in engineering the relocation of the ncaa from overland park to indianapolis and he is exceptionally well thought of in the highest circles of ncaa leadership as an attorney mr swarbrick has worked with numerous sports groups including many ngbs and he has a deep understanding of our business and the issues involving olympic sports a visionary with a rare appreciation for details and process jack swarbrick is the ideal leader for this effort with the capability of being the catalyst for change
1650947 for a long time we held the view that the logical missing piece for indianapolis was an anchor tenant
1650948 so the relocation of the ncaa was the critical piece in the long term strategy
1650949 its not so much chicago lost it as indianapolis won it
1650950 we knew early on we had to get that off the table
1650951 but it allowed us to emerge as an equal competitor
1650952 if you get to a certain level of parity financially other things come into play
1650953 there are very few of these that i would consider as i got to know him and understand him a little better i was intrigued
1650954 my impression was borne out its a university thats going to do some great things under president crow at the end of the day it wasnt right for me
1650955 we are going to throw one heck of a party
1650956 we will turn over our city to the super bowl when you come to our town you own the joint
1650957 notre dame offers probably the best overall package i can possibly think of in college football at this point
1650958 the best junior football prospect in the entire state of illinois and one of the best overall prospects in the country
1650959 and when coaches see that it leads them to believe that chris is a special player
1650960 when you send film to division i schools they see that he has a great motor that he doesnt take any plays off
1650961 i think offensive line is the best position on the field
1650962 you get to come off the ball youre already in the stance you have power coming out of it you get to knock somebody as hard as you can without getting in trouble for it
1650963 i am pleased to announce that steve orsini will remain at smu as director of athletics
1650964 i met with steve today and reiterated my desire for him to stay i am delighted that he has decided to continue to lead our athletic programs
1650965 id like to thank d j for all he has given to this team in his three years and wish him well in his future endeavors
1650966 we wont have darrin with us this season but i hope to have him return for the spring semester fortunately cornerback is a position of strength on our team and this will provide opportunities for increased playing time for our corners
1650967 its about how great the school is and the football tradition they have there
1650968 its just an opportunity i couldnt pass up definitely with john going there and fort wayne being such a big notre dame town it definitely influenced me
1650969 theyre recruiting me as an athlete maybe play receiver or tight end maybe somewhere on defense they said i had good ball skills and they could use me on the football field
1650970 i know theyre already loaded at tight end which is where i think i would excel the most but its just wherever i can contribute
1650971 i was at a camp in chicago and had an extra day so i decided to stop in
1650972 i knew right away that notre dame was the right place for me
1650973 i got the vibe from everyone from the players coaches students its a perfect blend of academics and athletics when i was there it just felt right i cant really explain exactly what made it right but it was
1650974 i just go after it and i swarm to the ball i play off my instincts and usually that carries me to the ball
1650975 i love to get involved with the run game most corners i watch they kind of sit back and wait and i dont really like that
1650976 you have to get a hand on a defender before you can hold him
1650977 charlie didnt understand what got him in trouble were offhand comments and peoples perceptions
1650978 those interactions you have with people be it the media a campus police officer a food service worker spread like a virus and he had no way to combat it
1650979 i dont care that they said it i care why they said it
1650980 if i said something to insult someone i owe them an apology im not a monster im a husband and a father
1650981 were going to be good this football team expects to be good
1650982 not knowing when or if you are going to get a paycheck is hard
1650983 the three hour wait was exhausting it was crowded and hot
1650984 there were no seats no room i had to stand the entire time and then i failed my test
1650985 most of those who work behind the counters technically have a temporary status so they have no protection
1650986 at busy dmv offices they have a lot of these workers so without them there are not enough people to serve the public
1650987 the governors mean spirited executive order will have a devastating impact not only to state employees and their families but to all californians
1650988 as weve witnessed with our local dmv branches this action has already made a serious impact on californians day to day lives
1650989 a tax increase will worsen an already languishing economy housing values are plummeting jobs are at risk and everything costs more for the average californian

1651019 surprise shock greed and ultimate greed thats the reaction im getting from people
1651020 notre dame has vacated its leadership role this is greed
1651021 and our constituency comes from all over the u s we expressed our concern to the cfa
1651022 the thing that has so many of our people upset
1651023 is that father beauchamp almost led the charge to save the cfa abc deal knowing all along that notre dame was going to pull out
1651024 money is the name of the game and people want to see notre dame thats the bottom line but theres plenty of room out there for football on tv and i think weve only touched the tip of the iceberg
1651025 i just kind of thought that just sitting there waiting i just kind of hoped that i would have an opportunity to go to notre dame and fortunately it happened and im going there now and im thrilled

1651034 they had some vehicles for a little over 8 000 that were electrically with batteries run i think we ought to take a look and see whats available
1651035 i dont think its fair to burden them with all of it
1651036 i just have a general hesitancy with retro adjustments as muddying up the administration of packages like this
1651037 it might take a while to get to richland for a meeting

1651079 it was a conscious decision to enhance the green credentials of the building because the consensus in the city is that we have to be responsible members of society
1651080 offices are a significant contributor to carbon dioxide emissions because of their high energy consumption a high profile firm such as eversheds can make a considerable impact on that additionally the environment is becoming an important issue to clients and so having an office which follows green ideals leads by example
1651081 the green roof is wonderful to be associated with up there it is quite tranquil the sedum is low and soft to walk on and it is a peaceful place
1651082 roofs are often wasted spaces it is a whole floor that people build that is never normally used
1651083 but we can be more responsible as designers by using them in a green way conventional roofs absorb a large amount of heat making london hotter but because green roofs are full of water which evaporates when heated they make the city a lot cooler and they also bring in wildlife
1651084 sustainability has gripped the office community i have never known anything like it
1651085 its what everyone is talking about the buildings we live and work in use massive amounts of energy there is a real desire to change and a clear acceptance that the way offices have been designed and managed cannot continue the bigger challenge is with existing buildings computers lights and heating should all be reduced that can make a big difference and can cost very little

1651096 this is a new way of making people aware of an issue of huge importance to the uk and we hope that players will not only enjoy the game but it will also encourage them to be more interested and engaged in the tough political decisions needed to deal with flood risk

1651105 as a trade union balpa has quite rightly fought long and hard to protect the final salary pensions of its pilot members in british airways and other airlines
1651106 balpa is now seeking to close its own final salary pension to new entrants and to impose drastic changes to pension benefits for existing staff
1651107 no employer let alone a trade union should impose changes to terms and conditions of employment without the agreement of its own staff balpa would not tolerate such behaviour from an employer that it was dealing with and the gmb will not tolerate this from balpa
1651108 balpa is extremely disappointed that the gmb has decided to proceed with a strike despite balpa making improved offers and without the gmb even consulting its members on those offers
1651109 we campaign against airlines not only because they have been closing defined benefit pension schemes but they have been imposing very inferior defined contribution schemes for new employees
1651110 balpa has offered new employees a first rate defined contributions scheme which is so good that the gmb negotiators originally recommended it there is a huge difference and it is grossly unfair to accuse balpa of hypocrisy as gmb now does

1651126 schauspielerei letztlich immer auch durch angst motiviert ist angst ob ich den schl ssel zu meiner n chsten rolle in mir finde andere menschen tauchen ab indem sie musik h ren drogen nehmen sich im sex verlieren mein ideal ist es mich in einer rolle so weit aufzul sen dass ich mich selbst nicht mehr sp re und auch die welt um mich herum aufh rt zu existieren nie bin ich lebendiger und st rker eins mit mir als in den momenten wenn mir das gelingt
1651127 dabei ist es erstaunlich wie weit man als schauspieler durch vorspiegelung an sein innerstes herankommt dennoch glaube ich dass das gef hl an sich beim schauspiel bersch tzt wird meist geht es vielmehr um die treffende geste manchmal empfindet man sein eigenes spiel in einer bestimmten szene als grandios beim zuschauer aber kommt nur hei e luft an und umgekehrt ein unaufl sbares dilemma

1651162 k mpft qatala gegen diejenigen die nicht an allah glauben bis sie von dem was ihre hand besitzt tribut entrichten als erniedrigte

1651210 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
1651211 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
1651212 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1651213 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
1651214 the use of the word theory can mislead those not familiar with science
1651215 this is due to an increased disillusionment with current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification it is not just solely about policing i am disillusioned with the current political strategy
1651216 i think this is half baked i dont think were ready for it i dont think the people want it
1651217 i dont know whos going to do it be justice minister because weve not been involved in any discussions on it it appears the alliance havent been properly involved in discussions on it i dont believe the sdlp has

1651222 they the dup and sinn fein really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1651223 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they can t expect that when they haven t spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1651224 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1651225 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1651226 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they can t deal with on top of all the others they ve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers

1651243 the competition in these games every night is a battle its not like little league and babe ruth where you can just pound teams its kind of neat to be going back to bristol because thats where we were in 2002 for the little league new england regional

1651246 hes a good coach granted he doesnt know everything about baseball but he pushes our guys to always play hard apparently it works because weve won another state championship

1651269 i really didnt think id win its a very nice honor
1651270 the blue jays had the most winners it looks like were all doing a good job
1651271 there hasnt been any talk of me moving up quite yet
1651272 for me to move up someone ahead of me has to be moved up to the majors then a spot could open up for me its always a possibility to go to the majors at anytime i am hoping for my chance but right now i am happy to be here in lansing and be with the blue jays the organization has great people from top to bottom and i am really happy to be where i am

1651274 lasorda stayed in the dugout and spoke with coaches and staff
1651275 it was one of the greatest experiences ive had in baseball meeting tommy lasorda and talking baseball with him he was telling lots of stories and we all listened to what he had to say
1651276 thomas was working on his hitting and they needed a trainer to go watch and make sure he didnt get hurt
1651277 so for a week i worked with frank thomas he was the best just awesome hes a class act and a great guy just being able to see his work ethic was incredible hes a hall of fame hitter one of the best players
1651278 once he found out i was from maine he kind of took me under his wing
1651279 hes one of the best first class all the way
1651280 the best part of my job is helping players and the challenge of keeping players healthy so they can develop and eventually move up the system
1651281 the worst part is being away from home being away from my friends and family in york
1651282 theres really nothing about the job i dont like i dont even mind the long bus rides i want to thank my mother and father because without them i certainly wouldnt be where i am today they are my motivation
1651283 he was outstanding at the plate and on the mound
1651284 to get a performance like that from a young kid like nate we needed everything he gave us
1651285 not get emotionally involved just stay calm and throw strikes i tried to take my time and take the crowd out of it
1651286 we had to play one more game than they did and thats a huge disadvantage
1651287 most of the pitchers who we had out there werent in our regular rotation they werent in it we gave it everything we had
1651288 hes a pretty good contact hitter and hes fast so i didnt mind him at the plate at all in that situation
1651289 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1651290 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1651291 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1651292 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1651293 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1651294 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1651295 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1651296 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1651297 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1651298 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter

1651306 there is still a long way to go though i think i could have played a little better but it was a good start and i have a great group to play with tomorrow nims and mangone are some of my favorite people so its going to be a nice day
1651307 a lot of people who have played in this tournament have played in rochester
1651308 but that doesnt make it any easier because its still very wet and it makes it difficult its rained in rochester more than any other place for this tournament i think

1651338 its been a tough character to draw especially because of the mixture of powers she displays
1651339 its difficult to find a way of explaining and making them clear to the reader in a visual way its difficult to make a character look sinister when there are no volumes in your face to cast any shadows
1651340 its fun the way she moves around and interacts with her surroundings the character had to have a goth vibe to it so when it comes to the visual design for the costume i chose to combine elements of different alexander mcqueen dresses conceptually and since the character had to be somewhat scary i tried to channel the visual creepiness from all those japanese horror movies like the grudge i cant think of any particular graphic technique i used other than storytelling devices to keep her off panel and finding the best moment to make her usually sudden appearances creepier
1651341 ill be the first to admit that im a fan
1651342 i dont think anyone working in this industry fell into by accident weve all been bitten by the fan bug and i think one of the hardest parts about working on this side of the fence is trying to keep that in check and act like a professional sometimes its scary when the fan part of you pops out

1651421 of the many reasons for the deniers to oppose him and despise him one of the most frustrating to them is the fact that their arguments have been so thoroughly debunked by a man who is not jewish has not professed to be a world class scholar and who is only a retired gas station manager

1651432 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
1651433 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
1651434 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1651435 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
1651436 the use of the word theory can mislead those not familiar with science
1651437 this is due to an increased disillusionment with current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification it is not just solely about policing i am disillusioned with the current political strategy
1651438 i think this is half baked i dont think were ready for it i dont think the people want it
1651439 i dont know whos going to do it be justice minister because weve not been involved in any discussions on it it appears the alliance havent been properly involved in discussions on it i dont believe the sdlp has
1651440 so how you can announce an agreement without other parties being involved in it escapes me
1651441 a blind one legged monkey could now orchestrate these regular farragoes
1651442 we took these risks and decisions in the name of peace and progress
1651443 northern ireland is crying out for bright young politicians with new ideas and fresh thinking yet how would they ever get a foot on the political ladder when every run of that ladder is occupied by greedy politicians with dual and even triple mandates
1651444 they the dup and sinn fein really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1651445 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they can t expect that when they haven t spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1651446 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1651447 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1651448 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they can t deal with on top of all the others they ve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers

1651451 teens with visible profiles make more conservative choices with respect to visibility just 40 said their profile was visible to anyone while 59 reported access that was restricted to friends only
1651452 if there is unflattering information about you online that you cannot remove be prepared to offer an explanation to employers who might inquire about it
1651453 the first thing you have to do is make sure youve got a tight resume
1651454 you need to highlight your accomplishments in a succinct way
1651455 speak up ask your parents relatives family friends who do you know
1651456 recruiters do use search engines and if things come up if they see an off color remark it can reflect poorly on the candidate
1651457 any time you apply in person you have to think about the impression you make
1651458 think professionally even if youre just there to get an application
1651459 and be aware of your demeanor and attitude think about all the factors that go into making a good first impression
1651460 dont assume theyre not interested if you havent heard from them
1651461 it is within you right to call and check on the status of your application and it communicates your interest in this job

1651479 i dont think the extent of the challenges here were fully recognizable when we took city center over
1651480 the economy is impacting the private sector substantially and were depending on them to make this happen
1651481 its kind of hard to put together a business plan on something thats illegal in the state of ohio
1651482 however theres not a lot of new commercial development occurring in our community in ohio or across the nation
1651483 we may end up partnering with a number of different developers
1651484 a lot of malls were built with big subsidies from cities as a way to try to revive failing downtowns
1651485 today mixed use is the formula that seems to be working
1651486 this is the most important downtown project of our time
1651487 there is no reason to hurry and there is no reason this effort cannot be successful
1651488 when its complete in the end its going to be done right
1651489 this is very heavy lifting i think frankly its the hardest thing this city has ever faced in terms of a development project
1651490 this is a nice little component that allows us to get some exercise and following that come on in and enjoy the fair
1651491 with the fitness community growing and growing and people wanting to maintain more healthier lifestyles this will be a fun thing to do
1651492 it kind of gives them information about foods they shouldnt be eating things they should be doing and questions they can ask their doctor when they go for their yearly checkup
1651493 it doesnt seem to be what we are looking for
1651494 it doesnt say anything they are still pretending they are responding

1651512 from the time barack obama was sworn in as a united state senator to the time he announced he was forming a presidential exploratory committee he logged 143 days of experience in the senate thats how many days the senate was actually in session and working after 143 days of work experience obama believed he was ready to be commander in chief leader of the free world and fill the shoes of abraham lincoln fdr jfk and ronald reagan 143 days i keep leftovers in my refrigerator longer than that
1651513 the obama haters would elect a man like mcsame who doesnt even know his geograpry the iraq pakastaini border chekasovakia does he not know pakastan iraqdoes not boarder does he not know chekasovakia is now the chek republic and solovakia he doesnt know shia from sunnis this is who you would rather have because you hate a blackman so much if obama had made all these gaffes it would be on the media talking point 24 7 mcsame is now saying that obama is the reason we have high gas prices if mcsame can sell this to you after those 2 oilmen have been running things you deserve him but he will not insult my intellegence i am to smart for that how in the hell did the republicans decided to have mccain run for their leader this man is pathetic prime minister malaki want us out of iraq mcsame says he doesnt mean it bush is working on a timetable now but theynamed it horizon factor he and mcsame is not even on the same page anymore mcsame is just rattling on the media trolls wont pick that up tho they are own by the repugs but guess what they dont own the intellegent american people mcsame will never become president he is not qualitified he is only a formal prisoner of war gen clark new exactly what he was talking about mccain cant even keep the members of his campaign longer enough for him to make a complete statement presidentof the united states are you kidding me

1651517 i have come to understand that money from the pharmaceutical industry can shape the practices of nonprofit organizations that purport to be independent in their viewpoints and actions
1651518 with every new revelation our credibility with patients has been damaged and we have to protect that first and foremost
1651519 i think we need to review all arrangements between doctors and industry and be very clear about what constitutes a conflict of interest and what does not
1651520 will mean less opportunities to help patients with severe illnesses
1651521 drugs that are helpful may not be developed by big pharmaceutical companies for a variety of reasons and we need some degree of communication between academia and industry
1651522 the larger issue here is that theres a revolution going on
1651523 thats good thats what we need and i believe weve been on the cutting edge of that revolution in many ways
1651524 the only hope to rule out bias is to have open access to all data thats produced in studies and know that there are people checking it
1651525 its a sales pitch and now its looking like a whole lot of people would have done better if theyd started on lithium in the first place

1651532 football coaches have gotten significantly smarter over the last 15 or 20 years at no time since ive been coaching at miami dallas or cleveland did we ever practice the way people practiced in the 1960s
1651533 also the numbers are not as big as several years ago when we had 105 kids on scholarship two or three minor injuries during training camp had no impact on a football team now we have a much better chance of being successful if we get to opening day as healthy as possible
1651534 the good thing about two a days is that you dont have to wait until the next day to fix your mistakes
1651535 when i make a mistake im antsy to get back on the field and correct it when youre going twice a day youre able to see your mistakes from the morning and get right back out there and do it the right way

1651544 while we expect the tax credit to get more first time homebuyers off the sidelines and into a home we wanted to stimulate home buyers and sellers at all points on the homeownership spectrum the jump start promotion ensures that all pulte homebuyers receive at least 7 500 in savings in recognition of this legislation

1651546 its all glamour in the world of comedy you know
1651547 it doesnt actually feel like the festival is here yet to be honest i was out last night and they still seemed a lot to do once the first few previews are out of the way im sure it will be as good as ever though
1651548 i first came up in 1993 as a support act at one of the smaller venues we played to about 10 people during the week and about 15 to 20 at the weekend which we thought was a massive deal
1651549 last time out in 2005 was great too not just because my show went well but i saw loads of excellent stuff like lee harvey oswald the musical which was just brilliant
1651550 its just a great festival with more and more diverse acts on every year i try to get out and about and see a few things each time i come
1651551 the shows where you have no preconceptions about what to expect can be the best too the ones where a poster catches your eye and you come back 10 minutes later and youre watching great entertainment its a special event
1651552 it enabled me to be invited back regularly at someone elses expense which is a very lucky position to be in so many acts lose money each year but do it for the sheer love of performing
1651553 i can understand whats he saying but theres so much money about now that it was only a matter of time before the bigger venues got more corporate and tried to capitalise on it thats just the way these things go like it or not when so much money is involved
1651554 acts can still come up book a room and put a show on though it will never lose that
1651555 i though to myself if i can do 20 minutes of material anything after that would be a bonus
1651556 i enjoy doing tv stuff and programmes like bbc sitcom not going out because i played the straight man in that which id not done before and didnt think would work but it did so that was pleasing
1651557 yes id like to do more acting in the future but it depends on the offers obviously if woody allen comes calling
1651558 shes up here with me this year shes does a lot of improv stuff which is great im looking forward to catching her show
1651559 on the face it neither mum or dad are really
1651560 my dads a statistic lecturer and my mum always wanted to be on the stage but never got that far
1651561 he does have a really wry sense of humour though which i guess i inherited and mums always been very creative and written poetry theyve just never been in the spotlight like us
1651562 i like to pop to a local coffee shop and spend a few hours jotting ideas down a lot of its rubbish of course but then it gets tightened and honed down into something i can work with
1651563 sometimes you race through 100s of jokes and realise youve only done 20 minutes so you either have to scour your memory or go back and do the same 20 minutes again
1651564 i tend to do groups of jokes though which breaks it up a bit and keeps a rhythm and structure throughout the set i can hopefully maintain
1651565 well its funny you should mention that because the numbers were up on my last tour
1651566 whether that was because id been on telly a bit more recently or that i dont know
1651567 its any interesting theory live comedy can be a really fun relatively inexpensive night out when its done well so yes it can be a great form of escapism
1651568 oh baby yes yes yes i love it when you hit my special spot uhhhhhhhhhhhhh

1651588 food allergic individuals need to increase the awareness of their food allergy among the people around them

1651591 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1651592 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1651593 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1651594 he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1651595 he wanted money to play the game his parents who work as civil servants did not have enough money to give him
1651596 we have yet to achieve bias free health care this has serious public health implications as we know that higher levels of screening lead to lower levels of mortality clinicians need to be aware that they may be sending signals even unintentionally that lead minorities to believe they are being discriminated against
1651597 respondents answered yes or no to was there ever a time that you would have gotten better medical care if you had belonged to a different ethnic group however we were not able to ask why they felt discriminated against
1651598 this contradicts the general assumption in public health that having a usual source of care is a cure all if men felt discriminated against by their regular health care provider they did not receive screening so there is something else factoring in
1651599 for example african american men may be stereotyped as being more violent which would affect how doctors respond to them and thus create a potential for discrimination
1651600 they can get to the second level and change what you do
1651601 if you bring pressure against us now and they hit a seam youre going to have a hard time catching them they give us the balance in the offense that we didnt have
1651602 we had three big grinding kids three great kids but they were grinders these kids can turn a 3 yard run into a big play and thats important
1651603 right now we really feel very good about jacob ramsey and john goebel as our i a and i b
1651604 where those young guys fit in is in a situation where youve got to give ramsey and goebel a blow or maybe an injury occurs that you need another guy ready to go
1651605 right off the bat you want to sit back and learn
1651606 but also get in the game at the same time realistically im thinking that i might get a few handoffs here and there around the fourth quarter
1651607 im expecting more playing time on special teams rather than offense but playing time is playing time ill be happy with whatever i get
1651608 even the guys out here tell me that they cant see me when im coming through the hole
1651609 they can get to the second level and change what you do
1651610 if you bring pressure against us now and they hit a seam youre going to have a hard time catching them they give us the balance in the offense that we didnt have

1651617 even the guys out here tell me that they cant see me when im coming through the hole
1651618 the defense was really being pushed to get ready to go
1651619 there is nobody in the country that is going to be able to push the tempo on our defense more than what they have already seen
1651620 we were able to get in some meetings and some work off the field
1651621 if the remains are not recovered from this launch the company has backup supplies that it arranges when it acquires the remains
1651622 its exciting to play receiver in our offense but they run an awful lot in a 24 period practice
1651623 youd better have some good solid depth in making sure you dont just wear those guys out because we are a big time vertical passing team coach molnar has a nice stable of kids and the wide receiver position is one of the stronger spots from an offensive perspective
1651624 the thing you always look for is great competition and theyre both competitors
1651625 they want to do whatever it takes to help this team win thats what you like and thats what keeps them ahead of the pack and they can make plays they can make things happen after the ball is in their hands
1651626 im not going to get my boobs out its more katies thing and i want to forge my own career

1651664 what inspire me some conversations about humanity universe stars faith sciences and believes
1651665 this country is experiencing its worst energy crisis ever driven by a confluence of factors including a weak u s dollar geopolitical tensions limited supplies strong global demand and the lack of a cohesive and comprehensive national energy policy
1651666 this crisis deserves the full attention of congress now not next week next month or next year it is too important to wait we believe that the fastest way to get oil prices under control in the short term is by reducing reckless and unfair speculation in the futures markets while at the same time enacting measures for the mid and long term to expand oil supplies enhance efforts to advance alternative and renewable energy sources and improve energy conservation across the board
1651667 without question energy futures markets when functioning with proper oversight serve a useful purpose especially to bona fide hedgers but in todays distorted market rampant oil speculation is devastating both businesses and consumers
1651668 reasonable financial controls and transparency which have been eliminated at the urging of the big speculation market players need to be reestablished
1651669 numerous experts from around the world peg the impact of oil speculation at 20 to 60 per barrel that translates into between 0 48 and 1 43 at the gas pump in recent months the number of paper barrels traded by speculators has risen dramatically peaking at 22 times the physical market on june 6 when crude oil shot up 11 in one session interestingly too that spike came immediately on the heels of a prediction of 150 per barrel oil by one of the speculators with the most to gain by the increase
1651670 oil speculation has upset the traditional balance between supply and demand
1651671 if congress would pass meaningful speculation reform oil prices would drop significantly within a matter of days or weeks
1651672 this campaign will result in one million messages being sent to congress in just the last three days by concerned citizens mobilized by the sos coalition

1651675 in the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for in our extended package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive
1651676 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps
1651677 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well

1651714 es que est en el centro de iquique una familia que no ha roto redes sociales ni redes laborales puede invertir en su casa el suelo es tremendamente incidente en una pol tica de la vivienda para que sta pueda ser vista como una inversi n y no como un gasto
1651715 para que una vivienda sea vista como una inversi n
1651716 tiene que ocurrir lo que nos pasa a todos cuando nos compramos una casa que cada d a valga m s y en las viviendas sociales eso no ocurre y el factor n mero uno para que una vivienda se valorice en el tiempo es su localizaci n una familia independientemente de su condici n social necesita estar lo m s cerca posible de la red de oportunidades que est presente en los barrios residenciales bien ubicados pero no en la periferia pobre

1651739 oh god wat zijn dat voor dingen op haar borst
1651740 hace unos a os est bamos en lucha nuestra estrategia era de confrontaci n directa y la movilizaci n callejera as pudimos frenar el alca acuerdo de libre comercio de las am ricas pero lo que est pasando ahora es muy raro muy novedoso y nos oblig a cambiar nuestra cabeza fue muy dif cil procesarlo qu quer s que te diga a veces me siento un poco confundido ahora del otro lado s lo tenemos amigos
1651741 yo s lo quer a escaparme de la granja y ped trabajo en una f brica de campinhas fue ah donde descubr un mundo nuevo con compa eros que hablaban de reivindicaciones sociales desde el primer d a supe que se era mi lugar
1651742 no quedan dudas de que ahora tenemos mucha m s participaci n social el somos mercosur ha creado un espacio muy importante para las organizaciones de la sociedad civil de la regi n
1651743 pero esa voluntad pol tica choca con el modelo decisorio del bloque que es muy centralizado y donde todo tiene que ser decidido por los presidentes si no se cambia ese esquema vamos a tener m s fracasos que aciertos
1651744 ahora hay m s armon a y a diferencia de los 90 hoy no necesitamos hacer tanto ruido porque la sociedad civil y los gobiernos est n involucrados en un mismo proceso ya no estamos en veredas separadas
1651745 estamos frente a un movimiento de cambio de sectores neoliberales a sectores progresistas de centroizquierda es una novedad que no debemos dejar pasar pero tambi n sabemos que esta oportunidad se puede convertir en una decepci n si la dimensi n de las demandas sociales no es atendida
1651746 en ning n lado se est dando tanta sinton a entre gobiernos y sociedad como en am rica latina ahora son m s f ciles el di logo y la participaci n y esto abre posibilidades efectivas de modificar el proceso de concentraci n de la riqueza pero el riesgo de nuestros pa ses es la muerte de la sociedad civil porque los gobiernos pasan pero las demandas quedan
1651747 esa noche tuve sentimientos de conquista y una gran sensaci n de esperanza por participar con mis compa eros en la lucha del cambio social y la reforma agraria
1651748 vemos con mucha esperanza la integraci n de los movimientos sociales los pueblos y los campesinos de am rica del sur aunque falta mucho para alcanzarla la lucha no ha terminado
1651749 estamos convencidos del proceso revolucionario que estamos construyendo m s all de las complicaciones porque a diferencia de otras revoluciones que fueron a plomo limpio y sustituyendo unos cuadros por otros la nuestra es m s larga porque es pac fica hasta donde nos dejen y democr tica en su esencia
1651750 cuando nos acusan de ser oficialistas yo me r o porque ste es nuestro gobierno pertenecemos a esta revoluci n
1651751 soy la tercera generaci n de comunistas en mi familia somos todos guerrinchas
1651752 hab a mucho temor en algunas organizaciones sociales porque pensaban que ser a un foro chavista pero respetamos la regla de oro fue un espacio de los movimientos sociales y fue todo un xito con m s de 90 000 personas que participaron en 1 800 actividades
1651753 estamos frente a la construcci n de sujetos aut nomos y de una nueva ciudadan a pero tambi n dentro de una pol tica clientelar promovida por el estado nos encontramos en un proceso sistem tico de colonizaci n de la sociedad desde un gobierno que maneja muchos recursos y establece relaciones verticales y tambi n frente a una etapa de organizaci n popular de sectores que se apropian de lo p blico para iniciar su participaci n en la toma de decisiones por suerte la realidad venezolana es muy din mica
1651754 con la debacle de los partidos tradicionales venezolanos en los 80 se empieza a hablar de democracia de ciudadanos pero estos ciudadanos proven an de sectores medios altos esto es lo que aqu se interpreta como sociedad civil mientras que los sectores populares no tienen ning n inter s en reivindicar para s ese concepto
1651755 en venezuela tuvimos mucha inversi n en materia de vivienda de corte social pero tambi n muchas denuncias de corrupci n desv os de fondos aunque por otro lado tambi n vemos marchas de campesinos de cooperativas de mujeres que se est n organizando para reclamar y eso se ha dado en este proceso
1651756 ser mejor que nos reunamos en el caracas hilton despu s de las seis de la tarde ya es peligrosa la ciudad
1651757 nos preocupa la relaci n que se da entre gobierno y organizaciones sociales pero son las circunstancias que nos ha tocado vivir porque el chavismo lleg al poder sin estructura y tuvo que recurrir al pueblo para gestionar eso es bueno aunque tambi n presenta un problema serio de autonom a que antes se daba con los partidos y ahora llega directamente desde el estado
1651758 antes ramos el movimiento contra el alca y el tlc pero con la intenci n de ya no ser s lo negativos cambiamos a este otro nombre para estudiar propuestas que puedan cambiar el modelo neoliberal
1651759 la gente empez a darse cuenta de lo que significaban la transnacionalizaci n la privatizaci n y la p rdida de nuestros recursos naturales el alca mostr su rostro y nunca m s fue bien visto en bolivia
1651760 queremos una integraci n social de los pueblos y sabemos que podemos lograrla pero tenemos que seguir atentos porque es cierto que los gobiernos han cambiado su discurso y hoy acceden a todo lo que exigen los movimientos sociales pero todo eso puede quedar en palabras
1651761 decidimos involucrarnos en este gobierno porque nos parec a que interpreta y encarna los reclamos de los movimientos sociales desde una perspectiva de cambio
1651762 es un orgullo estar ac porque sabemos que podemos ayudar mucho a los movimiento sociales aunque algunos te hacen sentir un funcionario de segunda porque ven s de la militancia social
1651763 tenemos que apoyar a este gobierno porque es un gobierno en disputa va hacia la transici n hacia un modelo alternativo y necesita la fortaleza de los movimientos sociales para poder enderezar el rumbo para poder romper con el neoliberalismo y para que en ese camino no triunfen las expresiones de la vieja pol tica que tambi n se incorporan al oficialismo
1651764 nosotros ya percib amos que hab a un cambio una cumbre con kirchner lula ch vez y tabar era muy distinta a todas las que hab amos tenido antes porque estos presidentes retoman muchas de nuestras consignas y tenemos que apoyarlos

1651769 el trabajo de la universidad es excelente se forman muchas personas calificadas y hay muchas oportunidades de mostrar nuestros proyectos en congresos cient ficos y de crear cosas diferentes tenemos amigos y profesores muy entrenados con la tecnolog a siempre en la vanguardia siempre dispuestos para ayudar
1651770 el plus que tiene la universidad con respecto a otras que tambi n son de muy buen nivel es que en la nuestra adem s de aprender procuramos buscar innovaciones el criterio de la carrera de inform tica es siempre aprender innovando
1651771 c e s a r es un movimiento una escuela de creaci n de oportunidades para el desarrollo humano y social
1651772 sab amos que las empresas solas no iban a ser competitivas que la econom a del nordeste del brasil es una econom a perif rica dentro de un pa s perif rico como el brasil y que no pod amos insertarnos en el mundo si no junt bamos todos los esfuerzos la industria de la tecnolog a de la informaci n est asociada a parques con mucha historia como los de silicon valley boston singapur al cabo de seis a os todo indica que sali bien primero se fueron sumando las pymes y luego las grandes compa as multinacionales vieron que algo estaba ocurriendo aqu y no quisieron quedarse fuera
1651773 si el directorio concluye que la idea tiene m ritos para ser incubada hacemos un estudio m s profundo de mercado de viabilidad t cnica econ mica luego se analiza el perfil del emprendedor muchas veces la persona idealiza la idea que tiene pero uno ve que el proyecto no tiene perfil para hacer un buen emprendimiento el tercer an lisis que hacemos es t cnico ya existe un producto desarrollado una idea y por ltimo se hace un an lisis financiero una vez que queda claro que la idea puede funcionar la empresa est aprobada para incubaci n este proceso lleva entre tres y cuatro meses se es nuestro filtro inicial c e s a r se asocia al negocio provee su infraestructura f sica sus contactos su experiencia su rea de marketing su rea contable su rea jur dica etc tera es el socio mayoritario del proyecto y a medida que se van cumpliendo ciertas metas la participaci n del emprendedor en el proyecto va aumentando hasta que abandona c e s a r

1651866 people of the prince which is to come will destroy the city
1651867 what it shows at the very least is that every translation has leaned on the very first one for the rendering of the verse just because 20 bible says the word is
1651868 they did not recognize the day of their visition the city would be leveled to the ground not one stone left upon another
1651869 the end of the city of jerusalem was in a war so the next sentence does not contradict what i have said it actually supports it

1651944 thats fine but its not what it was supposed to be
1651945 the scope of this agreement does not match what we signed up for
1651946 it will help our intelligence professionals learn enemies plans for new attacks
1651947 this is just a dream its just a dream wake up this cant be real
1651948 lengthening the pitch suits us because of the age of our team weve got an athletic team
1651949 we might find it big when were chasing the ball but we play 4 4 2 with wingers and maybe teams might just find it that bit harder to close us down
1651950 we want to make the pitch as big as we possibly can to play football on if we can do something to our advantage we should do it
1651951 we were one of the fittest teams last season anyway purely because of the average age of the team it was something like 23 24
1651952 making the pitch bigger and making people run around is to our advantage its a game for athleticism and pace and thats how we want to play
1651953 nothing at molineux is going to change unless we play well and win games then the place is brilliant
1651954 its down to us and were giving ourselves a better chance by having a bigger pitch to stretch the opposition
1651955 hopefully well get results and if we do the place will be hopping it will be fabulous
1651956 manchester city had a big pitch and if you were getting a doing on that it was always difficult
1651957 when you get promoted youre playing against better teams who then have more room
1651958 the manager has told me he is going to make a decision before the arsenal game
1651959 he is going to wait and see how we do and there is one game left so it us up to both dean and myself to work hard in the next couple of weeks
1651960 its a decision for the manager and we can only do what we have got to do
1651961 i thought we both did what we had to do well last night and the rest is down to the manager
1651962 it was nice to get another 45 minutes and its always nice to make a couple of saves which i was pleased with
1651963 dean is the one who got the lads into the premier league so if you look at it like that he is the one who has got the jersey at the moment
1651964 it would be a big blow not to play but i am not the sort of person to sulk
1651965 it completely pushed the central crash barrier out of shape and bulging across the southbound section
1651966 we called for an environmental protection unit as well because diesel was leaking over the road
1651967 we emailed him back gave him quotes we even spoke to him on the phone but it all seemed a bit suspicious
1651968 we told him we werent willing to send anything out before we were paid so he sent over the details of two credit cards both of which turned out to be stolen
1651969 the police dont seem to want to know and the credit card company dont want to know
1651970 because we caught them out before the fraud was actually committed there is apparently no crime but i find it very strange indeed that i have all the contact details for these people and the are not chasing them up
1651971 while the people who own the cards would have been compensated my company would have been down 7 500 which we would probably have had to write off
1651972 mr hughes needs to speak to the help desk at smethwick police station in order to obtain a log number he needs to say he wants to report an attempted fraud using stolen credit cards to the smethwick fraud team
1651973 a member of the fraud team will then make contact with him within 24 hours

1651977 she realises this is going to have a big impact on her future nursing career her partner was made redundant 18 months ago and the couple have two young daughters they are in quite a bit of debt
1651978 this matter was left in the capable hands of the police and we wont be making any further comment

1651994 our systems will be improved by the major scheme being better connected and enable more effective real time management of traffic in wolverhampton and across our boundaries
1651995 gaps in our vms system will also be be filled at four location on three of our primary routes the a41 a460 and the a449 but the precise locations of new signs will require further detailed study and consultation the investment in wolverhamptons systems will commence in 2011 and will be co coordinated with our neighbours

1651999 i think last chance saloon is a pretty accurate description of the moscow bar
1652000 the government has adopted a liberal approach to licensing hours some aspects of which i am not happy with this place was staying open until 4am or 6am and attracted gangs and other people who were already souped up from drinking elsewhere
1652001 i am set against the principle of venues opening up just to cater for people who have already been out enjoying themselves elsewhere i am quite liberal in my attitude to the consumption of alcohol but it is worrying
1652002 some members of the public might look at moscow bar and say close it down but it wasnt as simple as that
1652003 we all want to see businesses run legitimately and ensure the majority of people are not stigmatised by the criminality of a few by closing it down we are moving the problem somewhere else
1652004 the culture in wolverhampton at the moment is one of gangs and i would ask you to give me one more chance to turn this place around we cannot control what happens outside the premises in a car park or 50 yards away
1652005 its the prerogative of any member to call a decision in but given that this has been debated so thoroughly it is disappointing that we are now in another delaying tactic
1652006 frankly at the end of the day all that will happen is i will be asked to reconsider and i will reconsider but i think i will come to the same conclusion unless someone conjures millions of pounds from somewhere
1652007 sport england has sought to secure temporary alternative facilities for use by the athletics and football clubs until the new stadium and pitches are built to provide continuity of training and competition

1652013 i have been asked by the board to raise 5m and chop about 3m off the wage bill plus another 400 000 off the staff bill
1652014 there are some decisions which i cannot dictate one is the finance needed to keep this club afloat and i will never intefere with that because at the end of the day the club must survive
1652015 the bottom line is the security of charlton athletic football club and if the board say that players must go then they have to go
1652016 villa want to keep their best players like gareth but at the moment liverpool is a bigger club
1652017 every season since i have known villa they have tried to strengthen but if they lost gareth it would be a huge blow who do they replace him with replacing gareth will probably be the hardest decision

1652077 hsbc fully appreciates how wrapits customers feel about this issue and understands their distress and concern that a resolution be found quickly

1652116 its relaxing when youre out in the seas catching the waves you dont think of anything else theres a sense of joy in doing that
1652117 though im still very cautious of wipeouts falling off the board or when im stuck in the water for a long time the rocks out at sea are dangerous too

1652119 the waves were terribly rough but i was able to ride on the board without falling that feeling was indescribable i didnt even feel exhausted but there was this one time in kijal where i didnt manage to balance very well the front of my board broke hit my nose and it started to bleed i had to sit by the beach and wait while my friends surfed

1652142 una de las razones fundamentales de la desmoralizaci n de la sociedad peruana la impunidad de los corruptos alan garc a nos propone que creamos en lo que dice y nos olvidemos de lo que hizo que los historiadores nos ocupemos de su pasado y que volvamos al borr n y cuenta nueva el secreto de la futura felicidad de los peruanos
1652143 con alan garc a no estamos ante una persona equivocada pol ticamente que tiene malas f rmulas sino ante alguien que no puede controlar su personalidad hay quienes piensan que es c nico yo creo que no cuando miente el c nico sabe finalmente que su mentira no es cierta pero en garc a hay una disgregaci n cree que sus mentiras son verdad por cierto no es un loco en el sentido de inimputable es muy inteligente brillante en una serie de cosas pero entre la locura y la completa lucidez hay un abanico muy complejo y dif cil de definir encontraremos un garc a l cido en algunas cosas pero ciego en otras por ejemplo el tema tico es un punto ciego en su personalidad una contrapartida de este punto ciego moral es la necesidad de reafirmar su notoriedad a partir de medidas que pueden ser muy irresponsables cuando dej el gobierno el precio de la electricidad era de 50 centavos de d lar y el del gal n de gasolina de diez centavos el precio internacional era mucho mayor por ejemplo de dos d lares en el caso de la gasolina por qu pudo hacerlo porque una empresa era electroper estatal y otra petroper tambi n estatal y l necesitaba proteger su ego magullado por los resultados de una p sima gesti n econ mica su necesidad personal de no quedar tan mal lo llev a devastar dos empresas estatales esto ha cambiado desde entonces hasta hoy ya es el pol tico responsable que muchos creen ver yo creo que no
1652144 si el apra ya hace eso muy h bilmente desde fuera del gobierno como podemos observar con su influencia en el poder judicial en el organismo electoral en los gobiernos descentralizados podemos imaginar lo que ser cuando tenga el poder va a convertir al estado en un bot n
1652145 a estas alturas alan garc a no me parece un animal ideol gico no tiene una propuesta consistente que pueda considerarse alternativa en el debate con humala lo m s radical que dijo fue que quer a renegociar los contratos con las empresas extranjeras para que el estado tuviera m s participaci n en las utilidades te parece distinto eso ya lo hab a dicho la candidata derechista lourdes flores

1652206 that is why marriage is so much more interesting than divorce because its the only known example of the happy meeting of the immovable object and the irresistible force so i hope that husbands and wives continue to debate and combat over everything debatable and combatable because i believe a little incompatibility is the spice of life par ticularly if he has incom and she is pattable

1652469 whats lacking at present is weight and depth he delivers the great soliloquies with clarity but he doesnt always discover their freight of emotion
1652470 this is a gripping hamlet that could become great if tennant finds the courage to raise the dramatic stakes still further
1652471 is that for all the stage door excitement and box office success this is not the greatest dane
1652472 maybe its because hes such a tv pin up or maybe his interpretation of hamlet light on power politics heavier on personal hiatus is likely to appeal more to the female mind

1652476 in 1994 he was awarded an invalids pension for the damage to his health and he began receiving monthly compensation payments as well in 1996 in 2001 in connection with changes in legislation they were subject to recalculation and increase
1652477 however due to the incompetence of officials in social protection bodies the amount of compensation was groundlessly reduced as a result of which the man was deprived of a significant sum of money monthly that he was entitled to under law
1652478 based on the estimate the gas price for belarus will exceed 200 ths cu meters in 2009
1652479 under the contract signed in december of 2006 for gas supplies to belarus till 2011 the gas for belarus will cost 80 percent of the gas worth for poland less the customs duty less the gas transit via poland plus the gas transit via russia and belarus this year the gas costs 320 ths cu meters to poland the price of the next year will exceed 400
1652480 when it calculates the price for 2009 and sees that the price exceeds 200 the economic ministry of belarus sets to speaking of revising the formula referring to their failure to guess the gas cost the growth in oil prices
1652481 there has been no world practice of such contracts cancellation so it is impossible to evaluate the aftereffects of it
1652482 ms dos didnt get so bad overnight it took over ten years of careful development
1652483 at middlebury i focused on academics i thought i was going to be in med school or something like that
1652484 really until the last couple games i didnt think it was going to be possible
1652485 i was always confident in my abilities but when i looked at the other kickers and saw that i was one of the better ones then i realized i have a good chance at this in the nfl
1652486 a lot of guys ive suggested stuff to they dont listen and they dont make it
1652487 so thats why i say steve has a legit chance because he is now kicking the ball in a style and a form that can make it in this league
1652488 hes done a good job adjusting to it and his times are really good now
1652489 hes been tweaking a few things on his field goals but his kickoffs have been incredible
1652490 thats something that could definitely get a guy in the league and keep him there for a long time a guy like him could come in and really do some damage because he can hang it up there for a long time
1652491 i admired him for his internal honesty and his willingness to stand up very intensively for his own views
1652492 of course nothing is eternal but i hope every generation will have a person such as him
1652493 you get the impression that the younger generations know nothing about him
1652494 i may have read something by solzhenitsyn in school but i dont remember
1652495 i dont know him so why should i go and pay last respects to him

1652502 with the worldwide reach of the internet criminals can now operate from almost anywhere on the globe to steal personal information from almost anywhere on the globe in particular from our citizens when they do there are international online marketplaces where they can peddle that stolen information
1652503 if we all believe in ourselves all believe in our team i am sure we can do anything
1652504 all you have to do is put your mind to it
1652505 considering we havent got a big squad i think it is quite good in a way that everyone can gel together we know how we play and it is easier when only a couple of players come in they can just settle in
1652506 the main goal is to start the first game of the season and build from there really
1652507 i am only going to be judged on goals and assists but as long as i come back from each game knowing i have given 100 percent that is all i can ask of myself
1652508 he is a brilliant young lad brilliant kid and it will be brilliant to work with him this year
1652509 i will be there for him if he wants anything and i will be close to him but i am sure he will be in and out of the team this year and that shows a lot of confidence for a 16 year old to come and do what he has done to come through the ranks is difficult at one of the best teams in the world
1652510 i wonder if their factory was in a different neighbourhood if they would have waited so long to engage their spin cycle not to talk about cleaning up that blasted mess
1652511 i wonder if their factory was in a different neighbourhood if they would have waited so long to engage their spin cycle not to talk about cleaning up that blasted mess

1652518 its an important issue im proud to be part of this
1652519 the more ive heard about what happens to the animals fur ripped off them when theyre still alive its heart breaking

1652524 the sirens call terror management and the threat of mens sexual attraction to women
1652525 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1652526 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1652527 the olympic football tournament beijing 2008 is not included in the co ordinated match calendar and there is no specific decision of the fifa executive committee establishing the obligation for the clubs to release players under 23 for this tournament
1652528 the requirements to justify a legal obligation of clubs to release their players for the football tournament beijing 2008 on the basis of customary law are not met
1652529 the olympic football tournaments are a unique opportunity for a player as they are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1652530 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player and his national team who can benefit from such an experience but also his club
1652531 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1652532 fifa wishes to thank all those clubs who have released their players for the competition and shown great solidarity and olympic spirit in doing so
1652533 in view of fifas recommendation made to the clubs to release their players as well as of the olympic spirit the cas call upon the good will and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country in the olympic games

1652547 ich hab den schl ger fallen gelassen das gesicht in die h nde getan und habe es kaum glauben k nnen das erste was ich gedacht habe war m dchen du hast es irgendwie berstanden bist durch die ganze zeit die jetzt nicht so sch n war durch ich habe zum ersten mal in meinem leben auf dem platz geweint
1652548 es ist etwas was mit meinem leben zu tun hat auch mit meinem leben nach dem tennis als person tamira
1652549 ich war im schlechtesten zustand berhaupt so hat mich larri nach den french open bernommen das einzige was er gesagt hat war oh mein gott was machen wir jetzt

1652552 ich habe in brasilien das perfekte umfeld ich habe einen trainer der zu mir steht ein camp wo ich trainieren kann ich habe dort leute die mich unglaublich behandeln die mich auf h nden tragen wenn ich dort bin
1652553 ich will ihn nie wieder als menschen verlieren nie wieder als trainer er ist f r mich mehr als nur ein trainer er ist f r mich wie ein vater der mich auch in schlechten zeiten unterst tzt und immer hinter mir steht
1652554 man hat mir die chance auf punkte ein turnier auf geld und auf eine olympiateilnahme mit 17 genommen das ist wie wenn ich f r ein turnier wie die us open nenne und bin durch mein ranking das ich mir erarbeitet habe im hauptbewerb und der turnierdirektor sagt tamira ich will dich nicht im turnier dabeihaben
1652555 okay ich bin in brasilien trainiere im dschungel mit ein paar affen backhand cross und vorhand longline und hab dort meinen frieden gefunden
1652556 das olympische fu ballturnier ist nicht im koordinierten spiele kalender inkludiert und damit gilt keine entscheidung des fifa exekutivkomitees ber eine obligatorische abstellung der spieler unter 23 jahren f r dieses turnier die bedingungen f r eine solche entscheidung sind nicht gegeben
1652557 der ball liegt nun bei den clubs die spieler sind ihre angestellten die vereine m ssen nun selber wissen ob sie auf ihrer r ckkehr bestehen
1652558 wenn sie auf der r ckkehr bestehen und die spieler nicht zur ckkommen wird das zu einem motiv f r einen vertragsbruch
1652559 die fifa ist berrascht und entt uscht aber wir respektieren diese entscheidung nichtsdestotrotz appelliere ich an die clubs lassen sie die spieler an den olympischen spielen teilnehmen es w re ein akt der solidarit t in perfekter harmonie mit dem olympischen geist
1652560 das olympische turnier ist f r junge spieler eine einmalige chance auf hohem niveau internationale erfahrungen f r die zukunft zu sammeln davon k nnten nicht nur die spieler und die nationalteams profitieren sondern auch ihre clubs ich bedauere dass der cas den olympischen geist nicht bei der entscheidung mitber cksichtigt hat

1652640 our device combines the ability of microfluidics to easily transport cells in suspension with the ability of optics to perform sensitive detection
1652641 so far we have demonstrated a resolution of 800 nm but we believe that this could be further improved to around 50 nm
1652642 by covering the sensor grid with a thin metal layer and etching small apertures onto the layer at the centre of each pixel the sensor pixel will be sensitive only to light transmitted through the aperture
1652643 this means that the resolution is determined only by the aperture size and not by the pixel size of the cmos sensor
1652644 in principle we can push the resolution down past the diffraction limit to around 50 nm as the resolution is limited only by the size of the holes that we can punch
1652645 tapping into a new mood in government of lets share
1652646 there is a growing recognition that no organisation including the state can do everything and a willingness to say lets see what happens if we put information out there

1652648 it was our subscribers who said we like patient opinion but we are also seeing information on nhs choices so we now have to go to two places
1652649 we thought that should not be necessary given the way the web works
1652650 the mash up is useful for users and for subscribers because they get information about all the comments that are being made in one place
1652651 what we are really interested in is getting information and turning it into something of real benefit to the nhs and its users we felt that nhs choices could do more with the information it had
1652652 our subscribers include trusts patient groups interested in particular conditions and mps who want to know what is happening in their constituencies people who can really use information to make a difference
1652653 we are definitely looking at doing more because there are some very interesting things on there

1652690 the boys of there for tomorrow have become self groomed into a unified musical powerhouse that is sure to be one of those bands to watch out for in the coming months
1652691 ive got a lot of gyaan on the eating joints in this area having tried out most of them over innumerable such batting collapses i wish i could share it
1652692 aprameya rao has just added more junk to the internet
1652693 offering milk to snakes brings prosperity for the entire family
1652694 the high court order should not be seen as a set back to the efforts of the upa governments fight against terror
1652695 wherever terrorist attacks have taken place in the recent past rajasthan maharashtra karnataka gujarat it is the state governments which are investigating the matter it is their responsibility to submit the evidence against simi to the central government
1652696 we do want the situation to normalise but the centre should speak to local representatives we will offer our suggestions when required but those agitated by the decision to cancel the land transfer must be involved
1652697 right from the time of chinas application to hold the olympic games i have supported chinas right to host the games

1652700 asking a judge to overturn the legislature is no small task we fully understand that
1652701 now we are looking forward to taking the next steps we will pursue our full lawsuit to get all iowans freedoms permanently restored
1652702 accepting for the sake of argument that the smoking ban has destroyed one bar owners business there is no evidence that the law has had this extreme a negative impact on bars and restaurants in general
1652703 small businesses should have the right to choose which way they want to operate their businesses
1652704 no one should be forced to eat drink or do business in a building that has smoking
1652705 and no one should tell citizens where they can eat and drink if they choose to smoke in a business that chooses as part of their own business model to allow it
1652706 unfortunately these choices were ripped away by an overzealous and overreaching big brother government
1652707 i smelled it then i saw it and i thought man i got myself a big problem
1652708 i mean i was alone and i didnt know how i was going to get out if things went bad
1652709 i didnt really know what to do but i didnt have much time
1652710 i just had to get out of there so i called my nephew he was at home and i told him to get out front of the house right away
1652711 i was probably five blocks away from the house i bet i drove 60 miles an hour getting there
1652712 he just called me up yelling to get out front right away because he needed help
1652713 i went outside and he wasnt there so i went back inside for a minute it was kind of confusing but i went back outside and there he came down the street
1652714 i told tyler i really needed that wheelchair and it was in the back of the extended cab
1652715 they got the fire out but there wasnt much left of the truck it was like it melted it could have been worse the gas tank didnt explode
1652716 if he hadnt been there i suppose i would have ended up bailing out on my head and broken my arms but im not sure i could have gotten away from the truck if that had happened i couldnt have crawled
1652717 i carry him to and from the boat when we go fishing and help him like that if i need to get him down to the basement
1652718 we hit a deer on the way back to forest city and really tore it up
1652719 what a deal being paralyzed the fire now this my luck really isnt very good
1652720 its the exact same skill set as filling a sandbag
1652721 a catch phrase weve been using is scoop pour and repeat
1652722 people could see this as drudgery but were making sure they see this as a really fun event
1652723 if this is their first time volunteering for something were going to make sure they get hooked on it
1652724 i knew i was over the midwest when i saw the telltale mile by mile squares formed by the roads that crisscross the states
1652725 i want to show people that even a farmers daughter can grow up to be a commander of the space station
1652726 if i can inspire any child they can do something they had only dreamed of then that is my way of giving back
1652727 i planned my trip according to when my parents harvest their sweet corn
1652728 were seeing an economic slowdown and its not in one or two sectors its starting to become widespread
1652729 the national downturn has gone on too long not to have an impact
1652730 if we were a pocket of good news that good news is coming to an end
1652731 the housing crisis the credit crunch the rising price of oil it has global consequences and iowa cant avoid that
1652732 its not like we just hit a wall and the economy crashed that was a lot of flood impact
1652733 iowas risk of recession has increased but we dont think it will go into a recession
1652734 without strong farm income and healthy exports the regional economy would be dipping into recessionary territory
1652735 consumer budgets are being squeezed by energy prices and wages are not going up fast enough to keep pace
1652736 overseas markets are really helping iowa manufacturers i dont know of anyone who doesnt have a significant sales force overseas
1652737 senator tom harkin and i will do everything we can to ensure that iowa gets what it needs to recover but theres no doubt that if congress had acted before leaving for the august recess we wouldnt be wondering if iowa would get enough
1652738 despite what might happen in other parts of the country with additional floods or hurricanes or tornadoes as long as we keep making the case to congress we will get the resources we need from them
1652739 we dont want it to do any damage anyway but any damage it may cause puts us in the same mix for fighting for those same dollars
1652740 we dont want anybody anywhere to be hurt but funding is a real issue for the state
1652741 its strange being here to see all the destruction and the piles of garbage
1652742 they told me cedar rapids is the place to go
1652743 a lot of the friendships here are lifetime friendships theres no question about that
1652744 i look at it as if it sounds like rollers coming in on the beach
1652745 the goal is to get everything back up so we can get people back to work
1652746 allowing producers to cut this hay can fulfill a critical need
1652747 we may need to change the law if the judge interpreted it right
1652748 theres no doubt its probably the largest case in the history of the state
1652749 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1652750 appalled by what appears to be blatant and widespread violations of iowas child labor laws at agriprocessors
1652751 the policy of the com pany was not to hire underage workers
1652752 when it became aware of four such workers it immediately fired them
1652753 asks the public to keep an open mind and wait for the evidence before making any judgments about these or any other allegations
1652754 cooperated with the government throughout its investigation providing documents and opening its plant and its records to government inspection
1652755 prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1652756 will enforce iowa criminal law if there have been violations of the law
1652757 we could be looking at 500 000 to 1 million in fines
1652758 right now were interviewing individuals and there are indications that yes there are some people in management who may have known

1652974 i saw the spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him i would not have known him except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me the man on whom you see the spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the holy spirit i have seen and i testify that this is the son of god

1652981 we try really hard to offer the very best of new england and this is the focus it is what i care most about
1652982 it took some time to convince the owner about the new focus but now hes definitely on board with it and it shows in our food
1652983 im really happy im here i have the best of all worlds i dont have the worries of being the owner but i can pretty much do what i want in the kitchen and design the menu
1652984 at age 14 i was working part time as a dishwasher in a restaurant in kennebunkport
1652985 i came in to work one day and the entire kitchen staff had walked out the owner was not popular he came into the kitchen and asked me if i could do lunch i said yes
1652986 i just took to cooking i love it and its what i know i do best
1652987 i only have to cook for my wife and two sons
1652988 after here its like taking a nap while i cook i love to braise meats and grill its easy and really what i enjoy the most
1652989 as a little tip i have one on preparing risotto i make a little bundle and wrap in cheesecloth i use arborio rice and cook for 22 minutes in water at 150 degrees
1652990 these last five years have been incredible and ive been able thanks to the owners support to expand and diversify the menu
1652991 i want to cook and serve under used species such as skate and bluefish monkfish
1652992 these fishes are very popular all over the world at the best restaurants but new englanders are shy to try them once they do they love it last week i made some hake as a special and the owner who had never tried hake just loved it this is the fun part of being a chef
1652993 most chefs do dream of owning their own restaurant and i may one day
1652994 but right now right here i have the best of all possible worlds with an owner who really lets me control the kitchen and menu it cant be much better than this and i dont have the hassles of ownership
1652995 i tell home cooks to learn how to salt salt when marinating salt the water and learn not to be afraid of salt throw out that table salt stuff and get to know the good salts
1652996 its the best thing you can learn how to do
1652997 stock making takes no effort at all you can leave a pot on the stove all day and make some great stock and freeze it it could not be easier
1652998 in all its guises braised and whatever its addictive and so marvelously textured my dish of pork three ways is a very popular seller you really cant beat it
1652999 is that i finally have a menu that i love and patrons love its all about new england and as close to local and sustainable as humanly possible its worth it and so what if we dont have everything all year seasonal food is really the best and this is what i cook and offer here at the dolphin striker

1653041 our codecs have a track record of success broadcasting from major sporting events
1653042 i mix codecs are extremely well suited to sports broadcasting and were first used at the olympics games in athens tieline codecs have been used extensively by both radio and television networks to broadcast from major sporting events since then
1653043 at the games in athens our codecs primarily connected over isdn and pots lines these days our codecs are increasingly being used over ip and 3gip wireless networks the i mix contains all the tools found in a remote sports broadcasting studio it has a mixer matrix router relays communications and talkback facilities as well as codecs and remote control functionality
1653044 in beijing our codecs will be used over isdn pots and ip networks this flexibility provides broadcasters with the opportunity to dial over whatever connection transport is available at sports venues and other locations in beijing and china
1653045 ip is the new frontier of broadcasting and since 2005 tieline has been committed to shipping ip solutions for wired and wireless networks our qos performance engine software enables tieline codecs to withstand significant packet loss over ip and 3gip connections and still deliver continuous high quality audio
1653046 broadcasters can now confidently use ip and 3g networks for their primary broadcast connection we anticipate that the proliferation of high speed 3g and terrestrial lan networks around the globe will increase the focus on ip broadcasting tieline will continue to develop new technologies that complement and improve current implementations of ip as broadcast infrastructures and technology continues to evolve

1653172 we have no immediate and direct reaction but we are following the changes there and the fact is the lebanese government and hizbullah are now one
1653173 they wont be able to say we didnt authorize this
1653174 lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and lebanese president michel suleiman are to be held accountable for everything hizbullah does

1653176 the issue of future nuclear tests is linked to u s policy toward our country
1653177 if the united states continues to take a hostile attitude and apply pressure on us in various forms we will have no choice but to take physical steps to deal with that
1653178 if the u s increases pressure upon the dprk north korea persistently doing harm to it it will continue to take physical countermeasures considering it as a declaration of a war
1653179 because the yield was so small we may not be able to make a real determination at all
1653180 i think that there has to be some punitive actions
1653181 we need to have a firm constructive appropriate but prudent response to north koreas nuclear threat
1653182 ive adopted both my kids im thankful their birth mom chose life

1653185 he thinks were accomplishing exactly what we want to be
1653186 youve got to ask the question whether cbs was wise to spend all that energy on publicity and promotion when they had a new product
1653187 you cant retool a newscast like that and get it right from day one
1653188 its a little frustrating that people treat what is our beginning as if it was some kind of end these things take a long time to change
1653189 we knew there would be a lot of sampling in the early days and it stood to reason that a disproportionate amount would come from us

1653193 we hope the situation will be resolved before an unfortunate incident of us firing a nuclear missile comes
1653194 the nuclear test is an expression of our intention to face the united states across the negotiating table
1653195 what we want is security of the north including guaranteeing our system
1653196 we have lost enough sanctions can never be a solution
1653197 we still have a willingness to give up nuclear weapons and return to six party talks as well its possible whenever the u s takes corresponding measures
1653198 since there is nothing i can do in this situation i try not think about it
1653199 of course i understand that considering what happened we are all under the same threat

1653202 per anni abbiamo avuto segnali sul pericolo destinzione dei primati ma ora abbiamo solidi dati che dimostrano che la situazione peggiore di quella che si ipotizzava la distruzione delle foreste tropicali resta la causa principale del fenomeno ma ora abbiamo prove che anche la caccia sta mettendo in serio pericolo tali animali soprattutto in alcune aree del pianeta persino dove lhabitat ancora abbastanza intatto
1653203 ci che sta avvenendo nel sud est asiatico terrificante mai successo qualcosa del genere per nessunaltra specie nota
1653204 se salviamo le foreste possiamo salvare i primati il lavoro fatto con il leontocebo ne la dimostrazione conservare frammenti di foresta creare nuovi corridoi tra foreste preservate non solo permette a questi animali di sfuggire allestinzione ma anche di mantenere integro lambiente e di conseguenza di diminuire lanidride carbonica presente nellatmosfera

1653287 our goal in the program is to compel students to spend their dollars on campus rather than with area businesses given the fact that 100 of all proceeds go right back into the student body it really is a win win scenario for everyone we look forward to a long partnership and continued growth

1653295 but at the end of the day england havent got that player michael owen for me has to play every time england play because he is a proven goal scorer we havent got a recognised out and out international centre forward like michael owen it does put the fear through the opposition when they see his name on the team sheet
1653296 it half picks itself nowadays the team really i remember years ago you could sit in the pub or sit at work and you could try and name the england team and everybody would have a different opinion people and say pick the team and everybody virtually picks the same team bar one or two players tops and thats it so thats the worrying thing for me the first 11s very very good and the rest are not you know theyre not up to the standard of winning a tournament
1653297 for me i dont think the coaching methods are like the ones abroad you know in holland and germany and places like that everybody seems so comfortable on the ball from a young age

1653310 international volume and revenue grew 7 during the quarter while our domestic business was again impacted by the further deterioration in the broader domestic auto market in the second quarter based on the disappointing results in the broader market during the quarter industry estimates for new vehicle sales for the year have been adjusted down to approximately 14 million new vehicles from the 15 million expected at the end of the first quarter and almost 16 million vehicles forecast at the start of the year in this increasingly difficult economic market we remain focused on managing our business to mitigate these current challenges while we continue to position lojack for long term growth
1653311 while both gross margin percentage and dollars increased sequentially from the first quarter of this year our overall gross margin dollars declined 19 in the second quarter compared to a record second quarter in 2007 this decline was primarily related to the decline in domestic auto unit volume and 0 5 million impact of the accounting for absolute software warrants in the quarter
1653312 increasingly lower domestic consumer confidence due to record gas prices high consumer debt falling home values and tighter credit continues in large part to have a significant negative impact on the sale of new vehicles and related aftermarket products like lojacks the challenges we face are not specific to lojack but rather widespread in the domestic auto industry we are tightly managing our operating expenses to align more closely with changing auto market expectations
1653313 our international unit volume increase in the second quarter was in line with our expectations our performance was largely driven by the success of several licensees in latin america and africa we expect that international unit volume will reflect a double digit increase in the second half of the year which should partially offset the impact of the decline in our domestic business
1653314 during the second quarter the canadian auto market experienced a shift in mix away from boomerangs primary historical sales base to smaller more fuel efficient cars
1653315 the challenges in the domestic auto market reinforce the need to continue our efforts to diversify lojacks business

1653318 it is important to note that our outlook for the second half of the year is stronger than our financial performance in the first half based on anticipated double digit growth in our international business in the second half slightly smaller declines in our domestic unit sales and proactive management of our operating spending during the second half of the year the results also reflect our continued investments in our strategic programs to diversify our business and provide long term growth

1653380 as one of this countrys leading educators of the next generation of hairstylists empire is perfectly positioned to support cut it out by teaching our more than 11 000 students per year about domestic violence and how to respond when clients are suffering from abuse
1653381 but we are not stopping at education we are dedicated to truly making an impact by promoting public awareness of this issue which is so often hidden from view each of our 87 schools will be raising money supporting womens shelters and helping women learn how to get the help they need
1653382 we salute empire education group and their commitment to spreading awareness to help break the cycle of domestic violence in america its a powerful statement about the organizations compassion and community service
1653383 all of us at cut it out are grateful that empire gives back has embraced our educational program in service to victims of violence cosmetology students are all in a unique and powerful position to spread the word that theres no excuse for abuse

1653386 when rick and i first got involved we thought we were just two people what could we possibly do against a pandemic
1653387 but as we began to travel and learn about how hiv aids is affecting different parts of the world we realized that there was a very major piece of the fight that was missing or at least under mobilized and underutilized and that is the local church
1653388 we are at this conference because we think this is where the church ought to be
1653389 what we have before us is a global pandemic and the church needs to show compassion kindness and the love of christ as part of the solution
1653390 both a one legged and a two legged stool will fall over but a three legged stool will stand
1653391 there is a public sector role of government and ngos there is the private or profit sector role of businesses and there is the faith sector role of churches and houses of worship
1653392 each of these sectors brings something to the table that the others dont have
1653393 if you say the faith community cannot participate in healthcare you have just taken out most of the world because the amount of those without faith in the world is very small
1653394 after 25 years hiv is still a new disease and we need new strategies tools and programs
1653395 this is all about partnership and if we partner it is because we are different not because we are the same
1653396 one of the unusual things about this partnership with rwanda is that im not in the same position to lead with the vision that the rwandans are
1653397 my role in this is much different in america i can lead as it is my mission my country and my culture but in rwanda im in fact a servant im not a minister and im not a missionary im a businessman who is trying to find significance in the second half of my life and there are many others like me
1653398 our emphasis is on sustainability and scalability not speed we are in this for the long haul
1653399 through the development of a church model the number of potential health care partners is growing from only 200 doctors to more than 1 500 trained workers two per church and more than 51 000 western rwandans are now on arv treatment

1653401 so if you think its a good idea for the motherhood and apple pie society to utilize banners hanging from poles and the following week the american nazi party comes in and says you know wed like to hang some banners in a similar way you would absolutely be required to allow the nazi party to hang swastikas off the telephone poles
1653402 its a battle we fight in one form or another all the time
1653403 if the city wants to have a banner you can do that
1653404 because its the government speaking not the government allowing private parties to speak

1653409 all the four teams played very well considering that most of the players were from the off season break although they were under pressure from the supporters the players did fairly well and i thought it was an interesting tournament overall
1653410 i cannot pint point individuals but there are very good players that i have seen from these games but my observation was the finishing from the strikers as they failed to put away a number of scoring chances

1653426 during the second quarter freddie mac continued to perform its mission manage risk and add long term value through expanded business opportunities
1653427 while market and credit conditions remained very challenging during the second quarter as demonstrated by our increased credit related expenses and impairments on non agency mortgage related securities our credit guarantee business and mortgage portfolio both saw strong high quality growth freddie macs revenue increased by more than 10 percent from the first quarter including a more than 90 percent increase in net interest income we are capitalized above regulatory requirements and we continue to have open access to the debt markets

1653431 petrohawks haynesville shale investment has created over a decade of drilling opportunities for our company in this awesome natural gas play
1653432 since our first quarter conference call we have doubled our position in the haynesville shale our leasing and acquisition efforts are disciplined and strategic as we continue to add acreage in the heart of the play our proven ability to optimize costs and provide attractive price realizations are unique advantages we will use to capitalize on this play and grow our company in fact our operating costs on a per unit basis actually continue to drop while many of our competitors have reported cost increases
1653433 as we stand at mid year petrohawk is reaping the benefit of its initial investment in the fayetteville shale and other core properties and we have embarked on a new exciting phase of growth we estimate that proved reserves grew organically by approximately 25 at mid year and that figure does not yet take into account any contribution from the haynesville shale for production we expect our 2008 exit rate will be 50 higher than our 2007 exit rate and project 2008 average annual production will have grown more than 25 year over year pro forma for acquisitions and divestitures as our haynesville program accelerates throughout 2009 we expect to set even more aggressive goals for the company production in 2009 is expected to average 30 40 higher than 2008 during this period of accelerated growth the company will continue to value risk management through a low cost structure and hedging and maintain a capital structure sufficient to realize the value of our significant resource potential
1653434 mcnamara believes that uninspected poultry creates a risk to public health thats the beginning and end of our discussion
1653435 unless the agreement is changed if she says no uninspected chicken there will be no uninspected chicken
1653436 there is a wealth of data about the dangers of unlicensed unregulated poultry
1653437 poultry has in it abnormal amounts of bacteria that can make people very very ill as well as some viruses and thats the whole reason for food safety laws

1653441 we see a lot of people we dont always see
1653442 if we can turn just one life around one kid at a time
1653443 its just so amazing to me how involved the officers are in this community
1653444 he was outstanding at the plate and on the mound
1653445 to get a performance like that from a young kid like nate we needed everything he gave us
1653446 not get emotionally involved just stay calm and throw strikes i tried to take my time and take the crowd out of it
1653447 we had to play one more game than they did and thats a huge disadvantage
1653448 most of the pitchers who we had out there werent in our regular rotation they werent in it we gave it everything we had
1653449 hes a pretty good contact hitter and hes fast so i didnt mind him at the plate at all in that situation
1653450 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1653451 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1653452 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1653453 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1653454 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1653455 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1653456 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1653457 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1653458 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1653459 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1653460 we believe it still supports your program just in a different way
1653461 you have a minimum threshold to address programs and youre dancing around that now
1653462 we need people to understand our building needs to fit our programs
1653463 we tend to err on worst case side wed much rather come back and say its going to cost less
1653464 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1653465 i went out there and grabbed it and i was like oh my gosh that cant be gold it is and then i ran up to my dad and i showed him
1653466 i stuck it in my pocket and ran to town
1653467 we cant wait for him forever i dont think he wanted to be here in the first place otherwise he would have reached us after all the efforts we made to speak to him
1653468 we have replaced him with dapo from the alternate list and we will just have to make do with that
1653469 for us taiwo is over 23 and does not form part of the players concerned with fifas injunction
1653470 cas will rule on the problem on tuesday last night and we will conform to its conclusions if the decision favours the nigerian federation taiwo will go to the olympics if they say the opposite he will not go
1653471 it doesnt matter what they rule we have to go ahead with our own plans
1653472 its very difficult for us now with all the problems we have had
1653473 we have had all sorts of problems including accreditation and so on and we now have two players who may not play in our game on thursday
1653474 when you dont have all your players available the team just kind of picks itself
1653475 there is no pain when he walks but we will have to take him in for a scan later and see what happens hopefully he should be fine but if he cannot play that means we have only 14 players available
1653476 one week of pay for every six months of service hey not bad
1653477 weve been focused on our work for the past five years weve won pulitzer prizes brought down politicians and alerted our readers to corruption crime and fast breaking news what has that nose to the printing press work ethic brought us the departure of 150 of our colleagues beginning today

1653479 that comment was quite the exception rather than the rule and resulted from frustration of dealing with the profanity laced attacks such as those from reg
1653480 oh great i go to her site and there are two guys giving me the finger
1653481 both obama and mccain have been accused of flip flopping
1653482 people can make numbers say whatever they need them to say especially for taxes
1653483 so it s whining to point out that you re whining
1653484 democrats don t have that worry because they don t have enough sense and ambition to earn much
1653485 overall the business is executing well in this unprecedented inflationary environment and our near term results reflect the consistent improvement weve made since the third quarter of last year im pleased that we have returned to growth in the second quarter
1653486 while challenges remain at whitewave morningstar related to horizon organic r we are encouraged by dsd dairy segment operating income that was 9 above the second quarter of 2007 consolidated adjusted operating income that was 3 better than last year and adjusted diluted earnings per share that were 10 above year ago levels
1653487 overall we are cautiously optimistic about the back half of the year
1653488 despite the continued challenging commodity cost inflation weve faced our business teams are executing well back half overlaps in the areas of shrink and excess cream sales should be favorable tempering our confidence for the balance of the year however is a heightened level of competitive pressure we are seeing in certain areas of our business as well as continued volatility and inflationary pressure across the cost spectrum nonetheless on balance we are confident our dsd dairy segment will continue to perform well in the third and fourth quarters at whitewave morningstar the majority of the businesses continue to perform well however the anticipated recovery in horizon organic profitability is taking longer than we had hoped due to higher raw organic milk and other commodity costs and a highly competitive market we remain focused on maintaining our leading branded position in the category as we balance market share considerations against profitability in light of these factors we are comfortable reiterating our guidance for 2008 adjusted diluted earnings of at least 1 20 per share for the third quarter we expect adjusted diluted eps to be between 0 26 and 0 31 per share
1653489 i think youre just standing in front of the subs
1653490 the competition in these games every night is a battle its not like little league and babe ruth where you can just pound teams its kind of neat to be going back to bristol because thats where we were in 2002 for the little league new england regional
1653491 he gets us going and gets everybody up whether its yelling at us getting the team together he motivates you and then coach fernandes and coach brian pafford round out a pretty good coaching staff
1653492 growing up with him he would always take me down to the park and always was pushing me and telling me dont give up
1653493 hes a good coach granted he doesnt know everything about baseball but he pushes our guys to always play hard apparently it works because weve won another state championship
1653494 it all arrives on saturdays and they are kind enough to bring it over
1653495 some of the folks selling at the market have produce in excess that they might not be able to sell its hard for us to get fresh anything throughout the year so its great to have this its fresh healthy and tastes good it saves us having to go out and buy it
1653496 our kitchen is not sufficient for the number of people we need to feed
1653497 were putting out 80 plates of food on average each night church groups or families take on a night we get a great variety of stuff that way
1653498 dinner is probably the only pleasant part of staying here
1653499 this summer however has the most coordinated effort thats ever been done
1653500 i have been involved in local farming for years and in the past it happened at random or occasionally this year there is a collaboration of local groups and we set it up in advance with cross roads house the farmers are getting into the habit of gleaning
1653501 we brought a ton of green beans a couple of weeks ago
1653502 we were swimming in them even though tomatoes are a precious item we do have some they cant sell the seconds that arent as pretty theyre perfectly good but people pass them over
1653503 saving us money at the grocery store and feeding our residents better than ever even introducing them to foods they have not had the pea shoots were really a brand new salad treat for every one i cant wait to see what comes each week thanks so much to all the farmers
1653504 to lose such a gorgeous home and lovely and historic property is one of the forgotten heartbreaking losses to our city in the name of progress
1653505 my research on the house and the man causes me to concur the house had a history from day one built by captain samuel ham in 1809 he threw a lavish party for friends and neighbors when it was complete and after his guests left he inexplicably went upstairs and hanged himself in 1819 after marrying elizabeth clapp daughter of a wealthy merchant a young lawyer named levi woodbury bought the estate and made it his familys summer home and a working farm he used it as his new hampshire base while his career unfolded which it has been said has been unequaled by any new hampshire citizen it is ironic that shortly after the n h historical society was formed this oft overlooked man became its president neighbors did fight the loss of the house as they have been fighting encroachment from all sides ever since often at considerable expense and futile ends at the time of his death woodbury was considered the presidential probability for the democratic party of his contributions the honorable robert rantoul jr a close portsmouth friend said in his lengthy eulogy for this he struggled and toiled to this he sacrificed ease and pleasure and health and at last life itself in the protracted martyrdom of over tasked powers strained till the strings of life were broken in the service of his fellow man in this as in all things he lived quite up to the doctrine of the illustrious school to which he belonged in which jefferson madison langdon and jackson were exemplars that a statesman owes all his powers to his country
1653506 mental health court will provide an alternative to traditional sentencing mhc sets aside the adversarial process in favor of a collaborative process that seeks to provide prompt safe and effective treatment and supervision reduction in recidivism and links to services without compromising the safety of the community without services they cycle through our system
1653507 what makes this unique is that its being done with existing resources
1653508 as chief ive grown more and more concerned over the years as ive seen my officers try and deal with people that are chronically homeless mentally ill and addicted
1653509 if we can divert at least some of these people from jail we succeeded in saving time and money
1653510 its really plain and simple people that are mentally ill dont belong in jail
1653511 we hope it will divert people from coming to jail
1653512 to devise statewide sentencing alternatives for nonviolent offenders with a history of mental illness or drug dependency
1653513 the car was already well alight and a passer by who had tried to get the man out had been driven back by the heat and smoke
1653514 we managed to open the drivers door and the sergeant undid the mans seatbelt but then the officer himself was overcome by the fumes
1653515 the flames were about 20ft 7m high and the heat was tremendous but i was able to drag him out and pulled him about 400 366m yards down the road in case the petrol tank exploded
1653516 it was a split second decision and i knew that it could go up at any time but the over riding urge was to get the man out
1653517 it was an exceptional act of courage which deserved to be acknowledged
1653518 it begins working every time the user steps outside people are very excited because it expresses ecological and environmental themes in addition to the function provided of charging your phone and ipod
1653519 we came to the conclusion the boat itself was not a crime scene
1653520 we were there for a long time we pulled the boat apart and found nothing untoward
1653521 if there was any indication of foul play we would have taken every measure we could to examine that boat
1653522 is attributable to a much simpler factor good old fashioned greed
1653523 those who most need and desire the sort of information provided by a corps of professionally trained journalists will have no choice but to pay whatever exorbitant fee or subscription that will be required
1653524 maybe the times would do well to look at its pathetic attempt to appease the rabid right
1653525 this is how fox and now cnn following their lead after decades of failure
1653526 you suppose that the abilities to read and write and observe the minimal disciplines of journalism whatever those might be are exquisetly precious and rare and not widely available
1653527 you suppose that the abilities to read and write and observe the minimal disciplines of journalism whatever those might be are exquistely precious and rare and not widely available
1653528 fox is and always has been full of right wing wackos if you want objective and insightful news reporting and you re looking for it on fox then you are foolish and wasting your time
1653529 all this leftist chatter about how big papers skew right because they don t read like the nation is is obvious rot
1653530 all while whining endlessly that their intellectual entitlements are not sufficiently recognized outside the donor s board
1653531 we have home videos of me singing outside on our rock for the neighbors
1653532 i started taking voice lessons junior year of high school
1653533 last year i told my dad make me do it no matter where it is
1653534 i just went shopping with some friends im going to wear some black dress pants and shoes classy but youthful
1653535 im going to sing if i can dream by elvis
1653536 i was visiting my friend this weekend who sings with me in the colby eight group and i just started singing it just to get his advice
1653537 theres no way im going to have a bad attitude about it mostly im going there for the fun and experience if something happens thats fantastic
1653538 ive been a camp counselor here im in my fifth year i have a lot of experience working with younger kids theyre a big part of the show i would love to be the best role model i could in that way especially in a public eye that often sees trouble in the celebrity world

1653542 trotz unterschiedlicher auffassungen musste ich auch akzeptieren dass mein bruder ich und unsere familien nicht zu seiner zweiten hochzeit eingeladen waren
1653543 ich gebe zu dass mich diese vorgehensweise damals befremdet hat
1653544 h tten wir doch zwei seile mitgenommen dann w re ich schneller bei ihm gewesen dann h tte ich vielleicht noch was tun k nnen
1653545 als ich karls gesicht gesehen habe wusste ich dass da nichts mehr zu machen ist ich habe auch keinen puls mehr gesp rt
1653546 the second quarter was another outstanding period for fti across the key dimensions of our business we generated record revenue and profits and higher margins compared to last year as importantly we made significant strides in the execution of our strategy bringing an expanding range of capabilities to our clients on a global basis
1653547 our outstanding growth and profitability in the quarter reflect a volatile economic environment that continues to be a driver of demand for our services the impact of global credit constraints continues to spread driving increased demand from clients to preserve their organizations business results wealth and reputations and enhance their competitive positions during these challenging times this demand combined with the leadership positions enjoyed by our business segments fostered organic revenue growth of 25 percent with strong momentum in our restructuring economic and strategic communication segments technology once again had outstanding results and grew over 50 in the quarter
1653548 we are continuing to see the fruits of our investments in global markets approximately 20 percent of our revenue in the quarter came from outside the united states up from approximately 15 percent a year ago as a function of continued growth in existing international operations plus contributions from the acquisitions we made this year in europe asia and latin america
1653549 as the preeminent ion channel company our goal is to serve all the ion channel needs of pharmaceutical and biotech customers from early functional screens for profiling drug candidates or ranking within profiles during the drug discovery process to a complete set of in vitro glp service products for cardiac risk assessment
1653550 however some companies prefer to maintain testing in house for those customers were pleased to offer a new way that researchers can benefit from chantests ion channel expertise and exhaustive study of the characteristics of our ion channel library by purchasing our validated cell lines we want to ensure that all researchers have the best opportunity to identify ion channels as pharmaceutically relevant targets and accelerate work on providing new drugs to those targets
1653551 i was part of the process during that part of my life civil rights anti war protests
1653552 this is their country and this is their future we just want them to participate
1653553 if kids dont have the information lets get it to them
1653554 that was important to me that we open up a dialogue so that people leave talking about what affects them
1653555 unless youre really poor or have a decent job or are a child you wont be covered they absolutely dont understand the consequences
1653556 in the 2005 festival we hosted ireland and i got a chance to meet the irish coach ed randolph he and i started talking about how great it would be to do a return visit and 2008 was the year to go
1653557 we stayed in groups of three at our host families in bray and dublin and played games during the first four days
1653558 we were quicker faster more in shape but they were very much stronger
1653559 the irish players had a different style of playing get it down low and score
1653560 we did pretty good we won two and lost one
1653561 the only team we lost to have two players who played on the national team
1653562 i really liked staying in dublin i liked the city but the cliffs of mohr were the greatest thing ive ever seen
1653563 if it rains at rochester it is going to be pretty tough because its already very wet and quite muddy
1653564 people are going to have to have a lot of patience
1653565 there is still a long way to go though i think i could have played a little better but it was a good start and i have a great group to play with tomorrow nims and mangone are some of my favorite people so its going to be a nice day
1653566 a lot of people who have played in this tournament have played in rochester
1653567 but that doesnt make it any easier because its still very wet and it makes it difficult its rained in rochester more than any other place for this tournament i think
1653568 dealing is not allowed and they can be thrown out of the organization and we certainly dont want that this is to ensure they support themselves and each other i thank abigail for the info
1653569 if a forester identified which trees can go perhaps residents could assist in removing them there are many details to work out including liability safety oversight and the removal of brush
1653570 they would have to mark trees that could be cut and remove brush and debris or it could become a fire hazard
1653571 i tell you this year with the high cost of fuel people will be cutting up their living room furniture i am going to do a piece for the town newsletter about heating safety
1653572 i burn wood a lot of wood but i would not be able to take advantage of that
1653573 its an excellent idea the wood couldnt be used this winter because it would be green it wouldnt have a chance to dry out
1653574 you never know what the oil price is going to be next year wed need some sort of waiver in place in case of accidents or injuries
1653575 im heading out to new orleans friday and will be off duty for a handful of days so try to survive without me
1653576 that s the ticket buy votes with promises of a 1 000 gift
1653577 i trust a troop on the ground and what he may have heard and seen rather than what he was told to correct by his superiors
1653578 just like the clinton s obama and most democrats loathe the military
1653579 opposing this with a bad interpretation from the liberal army and military times
1653580 depicting a black man in tandem with a couple of whorish white girls doesn t have a racist subtext
1653581 well why arent you asking for a raise for the kids then
1653582 in a new careerbuilder com survey 41 percent of employers said that people who dress better or more professionally tend to be promoted more often than others in their organization sixty four percent of employers surveyed have banned flip flops while an additional 49 percent have forbidden mini skirts thirty eight percent banned sleeveless shirts and 28 percent have prohibited jeans more than one third 35 percent of companies have gone as far as to send employees home for unsuitable work garb
1653583 for all of mccains personal qualities were learning that the machine behind the gop simply re makes the campaign in its own coulterite image instead of actually fighting on the core questions how do we get out of iraq with the least damage how do we get past carbon based energy how do we tackle al qaedas new base in pakistan and within the nuclear armed pakistani government how will we reduce the massive debt bequeathed us by the bush rove gop how do we restore the geneva conventions we are debating peoples cultural insecurities the slow collapse of conservatism as a coherent governing philosophy is not unrelated to this
1653584 over the entire 1980 86 period it is estimated that depending on the assumed supply curve price elasticity the wpt reduced domestic oil production from between 320 million barrels 1

1653586 solzhenitsyn did important work exposing the gulag but he has always been an ultra reactionary
1653587 i believe that people who can t tell us if it will rain on friday can tell us that the polar ice caps will melt away in ten years if i don t start driving a prius
1653588 democratic candidate barack obama on saturday backed away from rival john mccains challenge for a series of joint appearances agreeing only to the standard three debates in the fall
1653589 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said
1653590 barack obama has sent a letter to the co chairs of the democratic national convention s credentials committee urging them to pass a resolution allowing the democratic delegations from florida and michigan to be fully represented at the democratic national convention
1653591 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
1653592 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
1653593 cant wait for woody to explain how this is all bill clintons fault

1653606 we are very pleased with our performance this quarter where we once again set company records in production net income and cash flow

1653612 i think it is a major duty for a woman to be independent
1653613 independence was my obsession when i was 20 it was not making money it was making my own money modeling meant i did not have to rely on my parents or a man
1653614 i learned how other people lived i was trying to speak other languages
1653615 it is certainly not german philosophy but it was very instructive because it was made up of real life you travel you are always alone and you better be well grounded because its easy to lose yourself
1653616 she was full of life and wit she was beyond polite
1653617 so many like linda and christy had periods of being moody and difficult she was always perfect
1653618 shes clever super well educated and very focused she is like the heroine of a book or a movie
1653619 i bore myself silly with monogamy i prefer polygamy and polyandry
1653620 its that i never hide them its a different thing i have not one day of regret
1653621 carlas taste in men has always been fascinating i have never seen a man fawn over carla she chooses her equal
1653622 i have a very good relationship with exes i have a good relationship with all the boyfriends i had sometimes im the godmother of their children im always good friends with their wives
1653623 i was thinking of someone more related to my life
1653624 i was really surprised by him by his youth his energy his physical charm which you could not actually see so much on television his charisma i was surprised by everything his poise and what he said and the way he said it
1653625 then i called jacques and said what did you do
1653626 actually nicolas did call a little later that same night
1653627 your mother invited me to lunch is it all right if i come back sometime
1653628 its a good thing he had seduced many women and she was a kind of seductress when two like this meet it can be good
1653629 i never realized how many nude pictures i did before i met nicolas
1653630 plus i have a body that would allow me to pose nude without being very provocative
1653631 you must know that this is going to come out
1653632 well at least im not dodging sniper bullets in helmand
1653633 there was a knock at my door and when i opened it four men came in bearing an enormous cheque
1653634 is there anybody out there who is lost and hurt and lonely too
1653635 are you lost or incomplete cant find your missing piece
1653636 if you go and leave me down here on my own then ill wait for you
1653637 im scared about the future and i want to talk to you
1653638 when you feel so tired and you cant sleep stuck in reverse
1653639 give me time and give me space give me real dont give me fake
1653640 im going to buy a gun and start a war if you can tell me something worth fighting for
1653641 i am pleased to report that standard life has had a successful first half in 2008 despite more difficult market conditions
1653642 resilience to falling investment markets due to standard lifes structure post mutualisation
1653643 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1653644 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1653645 women particularly mothers can experience considerable strain when attitudes reinforce the notion that employment and family interests conflict
1653646 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1653647 the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working means women are presented with impossible choices forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities
1653648 the board remains confident that the turnaround strategy will deliver sustainable long term growth and is therefore maintaining its investment in programming
1653649 however given the market uncertainty itv is revising its global content and online targets
1653650 itv had previously set a group revenue target of 3 5 per cent compound annual growth to 2010
1653651 with broadcasting revenues accounting for 80 per cent of overall revenues group revenue growth will be largely dependent on television advertising market growth
1653652 whilst our visibility on advertising revenues beyond september is limited with a strong schedule in place for the rest of the year and planned for 2009 we are confident that we will continue to outperform
1653653 todays announcement marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio

1653657 continuing investment in biometric technology and enhanced security measures will help ensure that passport security is maintained now and in the future
1653658 were not claiming that terrorists will be able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow but it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way
1653659 some of bhagat singhs followers had decided to pull down the union jack and hoist the tricolor at the hoshiarpur court but when these people didnt turn up an enthusiastic teenager who incidentally had turned 16 that very day performed the act when produced before the british magistrate he stated his name as london tod singh one who could demolish london
1653660 they melted down a little bit and i just kept going under par
1653661 i just tried to stay solid for the whole round because of my score i was in the third to last group and didnt know how i stood against the leaders but i knew i was in the hunt and they would have to shoot a pretty good number
1653662 i play competitively in florida but when im back here im working and dont play that much
1653663 i do a lot of teaching as well i practice 10 to 15 minutes here and there just to keep my game sharp but i havent played too many competitive rounds so it was somewhat of a surprise to play like this
1653664 getting away and going to a different venue was nice
1653665 we have had a busy four weeks at abenaqui so it was nice to get away for a while
1653666 quil faut am nager gen ve pour que f tes et ramadan puissent coexister
1653667 these are two very important programs that we provide for the schools which my department recognizes as invaluable to the community
1653668 the choice to make these two changes does not come lightly
1653669 weve had excellent police coverage in our schools in the past and well have to see how this works out
1653670 the grade 5 d a r e drug and alcohol resistance education program will be a loss
1653671 however as you are aware the amount budgeted for overtime has not increased in the last two budget cycles
1653672 in order to compensate for what will inevitably be a shortfall in this budget line i must reinstate the floating position throughout the year to cover vacation time
1653673 also have patrolmen spend more time in our schools during their normally scheduled patrol hours
1653674 if you could know what we know you would support it
1653675 his love of country music in which case he just has bad taste
1653676 if senator mccain achieves what would until thursday have seemed to be an improbable victory come fall his opponents decision to give a foreign policy speech to europeans will be seen as the turning point in this seasons democratic presidential fortunes long snip
1653677 either the europeans in the audience did not hear or chose to ignore the driving force of the speech which was obamas call to seek a partnership that extends across this entire continent
1653678 on paper that last comment is one that der fuhrer himself would have applauded
1653679 still i wouldn t dismiss the effect of the media s desire for a tight race at this point they seem to have a definite inclination to keep mccain afloat and may succeed in doing so
1653680 ask yourself what has george w bush done it s a simple question with a simple answer
1653681 some democratic campaign buttons made for distribution in idaho show an unlikely pair democratic presidential candidate
1653682 i ll give woody this much he s one of the very few conservatives i ve observed that has any time to engage at all with liberals
1653683 witnesses said the attack was cut short after some church members tackled the gunman and held him until police arrived
1653684 if you look closely you ll find that gallup poll oversampled people in line for the early bird special at red lobster
1653685 look dan i don t see how you are in a good place to be critiquing the bias of conservatives on this blog
1653686 show me one instance you have every shown any objectivity by criticizing your candidate for anything
1653687 you go on show me one instance you have every shown any objectivity by criticizing your candidate for anything
1653688 just tell me one thing barack obama has done that you admire
1653689 the really amusing thing is that if woody had lived in hitler s time he would have been in the front row at the nuremberg rallies
1653690 you are following the candidate with a similar style with nothing more than emotion and rhetoric
1653691 if it werent for bad luck id have no luck at all
1653692 you left out a stretch of people two kilometers long the local authorities estimated 200 000 it certainly seems credible to me
1653693 the straight talk express is going into desperation mode and it won t be pretty mccain s rants are already raising eyebrows
1653694 no official spokesman for maariv told this to any of the papers
1653695 the obama campaign did not give us a copy of the letter or approve it for printing
1653696 how can you be so duped do you want to believe that badly
1653697 because the surge is working the surge is working the surge is working
1653698 whose philosophy to you suspect that maliki finds more acceptable
1653699 from now on when you say that you are going to the border for a story we ll know that you are really sitting at home in front of your computer and watching cnn there s no reason to be there also i plan on visiting italy this summer through an interactive tour over the internet it s the same thing
1653700 setting aside that mccain is a lying philandering whore and that obama is our only hope to keep from totally crumbling as a nation
1653701 im afraid that this guy actually would rather win the presidency than pander to people like me
1653702 its okay for obama to say whatever it takes to win because nudge wink hell do what
1653703 reagan made candid considerate and tough statements that he rarely made in a public speech or open forum
1653704 the shorter obama maniacs it s okay for obama to say whatever it takes to win because nudge wink he ll do what we want when he s elected
1653705 i find it particularly interesting that someone who voted twice for a little puke like gwb and follows the stock wingnut line on iraq considers themselves above voting for mccain he should be your hero for continuing to give an utterly bankrupt strategy rhetorical cover
1653706 the obamamessiah no experience no plan no nothing but empty phrases and magical wishing for a better place yes we can indeed putz
1653707 gm has become suffused with reg s resentment and potty mouth
1653708 reg you re not going to take that from gm are you
1653709 nothing but empty phrases and magical wishing for a better place
1653710 you georgians with your trifecta of crappy professional sports teams
1653711 reg has a great deal of trouble taking it from anyone who will argue back
1653712 the interview was conducted in english malikis arabic answers were then translated into english by malikis own translator and the completed transcript was later provided to maliki for his approval before publication
1653713 oh he looked over here hes so cute go say something to him does he like me
1653714 you re completely nuts if you think obama is going to eviscerate the military
1653715 russia currently is making plans to deploy long range bombers in cuba
1653716 russia is not some puny country and have you noticed china isn t small but even small nations only need one weapon
1653717 we won the cold war when the soviet union couldn t keep pace with our military technology
1653718 revised estimates by the central intelligence agency indicate that soviet expenditures on defense remained more or less constant throughout the 1980s neither the military buildup under jimmy carter and reagan nor sdi had any real impact on gross spending levels in the ussr
1653719 it s absolutely insane to think that you don t benefit from our defense
1653720 what mlb team currently holds the record for consecutive post season appearances
1653721 for those who oppose the death penalty and want to see it end our best bet is to vote for barack obama because his supporters have been working behind the scenes to end this practice
1653722 hanging from the neck of a live goose chasing a speeding wheel of cheese down a mountainside children smoking europeans do all of this and more spiegel onlines new series brings you up to date on the ins and outs of europes weird ways
1653723 finally barack obamas campaign has settled on a site for his berlin speech but some german politicians have now criticized his choice as being one full of nazi related symbolism
1653724 barack obamessiah goes to berlin not since 1939 have so many germans turned out to hear a politician in berlin
1653725 once we knew about the ss dead at bitburg knowing that these ss people were seventeen to eighteen years of age and knowing that some germans were forced to become members of the ss having no alternative the question was should this be a reason to cancel
1653726 once reagan learned that kohl would really be badly damaged by a withdrawal he said we cant do that i owe him
1653727 the siegess ule in berlin was moved to where it is now by adolf hitler he saw it as a symbol of german superiority and of the victorious wars against denmark austria and france
1653728 whether barack obama was advised correctly in his choice of the siegess ule as the site to hold a speech on his vision for a more cooperative world
1653729 i come to berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before tonight i speak to you not as a candidate for president but as a citizen a proud citizen of the united states and
1653730 were victims just as surely as the victims of the concentration camps did someone say something about puking
1653731 the threat of our military s ability to retaliate has helped to protect you from larger powers
1653732 aren t reaganoids the folks who love to jabber about the pitfalls of moral equivalence
1653733 i ve sold a few stories but i d hate to try to make a living at it
1653734 i get everything i need from bloomberg gratis bloomberg is featured on my site every day for free
1653735 incidentally i got a subscriber missive from the wsj saying that with president bush now again authorizing public negotiations with iran see the morning column and on the verge of ordering further iraq troop withdrawals this will hurt obama no this will validate obama
1653736 theres nothin like a good joke and that was nothing like a good joke
1653737 scott mcclellan is a lying sack of shit and id tell him so myself if he werent going straight to hell when he dies
1653738 id like a glass of milk for me and a whiskey for my poodle
1653739 yeah well id like an impartial and independent judiciary but try telling that to bush hastert and the rest of the gop
1653740 there s nothin like a good joke and that was nothing like a good joke
1653741 never agreed with the man but cannot argue with the quality of his writing
1653742 i can pull any assertion out of my ass because im a hysterical crackpot passing as a conservative
1653743 al gore himself admitted to exaggerating and misleading the public to gain attention to his cause
1653744 exaggerates and misleads the public to gain attention to global warming
1653745 who was the genius who said i should challenge him to go to iraq
1653746 i intend to deceive and mislead people over the reality of the matter i want them to have the wrong impression so as to do what i want
1653747 funny but i always thought the constitution and the bill of rights was more important than a rap singer
1653748 so why does he need to flip flop in order to get elected
1653749 our only political party has two right wings one called republican the other democratic
1653750 obama s vaunted ability and willingness to cut through the usual thin gruel that passes for discourse in this country is not a universal solvent
1653751 what were the telecomm companies going to do when they received the orders from the admin to cooperate with this
1653752 jackson said that he wanted to cut his nuts off
1653753 anyone who says they aren t surprised by obama s vote on this should consider cutting way back on the cynicism
1653754 whatever else he is the guy obama is the opposite of stupid
1653755 and is exactly the same politics that could have prevented
1653756 and is exactly the same politics that could have allowed
1653757 gawd we do live in two americas and parallel universes
1653758 having a democratic president and particularly barack obama should allow us to change this mistake barack obama believes in the constitution hes a constitutional scholar i believe that he will have a better chance to look at these powers that have been given to the executive branch and even though that he will be running the executive branch i think he will understand and help take the lead in fixing some of the worst provisions so this is a huge setback and it would have been much better for democrats to stand together and not let it happen in the first place cause its much harder to change it after the fact but i do believe that barack obama is well positioned both in terms of his knowledge and his background and his beliefs to correct this and so i do think that people have a right to be disappointed but i also think they have the right to hope for change on this issue in particular starting in january
1653759 power limited by law is the only thing that makes the rule of law work
1653760 the tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the state of exception in which we live is not the exception but the rule we must attain to a conception of history that is in keeping with this insight then we shall clearly realize that it is our task to bring about a real state of exception and this will improve our position in the struggle against fascism one reason why fascism has a chance is that in the name of progress its opponents treat it as a historical norm the current amazement that the things we are experiencing are still possible in the twentieth century is not philosophical this amazement is not the beginning of knowledge unless it is the knowledge that the view of history which gives rise to it is untenable
1653761 the fetishzation of hollow liberal democracy by pitiful hope fiends
1653762 i ve seen the claim that there is broad coopoeration between most of the west s intelligence agencies
1653763 if by the end of october obama promises to put a nascar track around the white house
1653764 he wins in november and then lurches back left to the position you favor because that is what he believes because all those supporters will demand it and because the democrat majority in congress will ensure it
1653765 many of obamas strongest supporters who are uneasy upset dismayed and even angry
1653766 i think we see that they campaign to the left or right during the nomination contest and then move to the center for the presidential campaign
1653767 you seem to forget or ignore the electorate sweeping in a republican house and senate sniper
1653768 wir stehen in engem kontakt mit den afghanischen beh rden und bem hen uns um eine aufkl rung des sachverhalts
1653769 das problem ist heute weniger das aufsp ren der p dophilen als vielmehr die kontrolle ber sie wenn sie das gef ngnis verlassen

1653771 wir wollen sichergehen dass die kommissionsmitglieder den wald ber den sommer nicht vergessen

1653774 we remain focused on our strategic customer development and business expansion initiatives to drive continued growth in our business and increased profitability and value for our shareholders
1653775 oh all men are useless no wonder he couldnt get the job done in time
1653776 are you a mother lets see what kind of job you want to do

1653778 se es mas feliz viviendo en una cabana dentro de un parque que en un palacio sin jardin
1653779 while the decline we experienced in same store sales volume in the quarter was not totally unexpected the pricing pressure for our products in most of our markets was greater than anticipated this combined with increasing aggregate costs and fuel prices resulted in a decline in our raw material spread as a percent of revenue and our margins on a comparative basis to combat this trend we are aggressively managing our raw material input costs these general market conditions are expected to continue until concrete demand begins to improve
1653780 our liquidity and financial condition remained strong during the second quarter as of june 30 2008 we had approximately 97 million of liquidity available keeping us well positioned for future operating conditions our free cash flow improved substantially this quarter compared to the second quarter of last year and based on our current outlook we expect to generate positive free cash flow in the second half of 2008
1653781 as we stated last quarter we are facing a challenging environment for volumes going forward and we expect to see continued quarterly decreases in demand on a year over year basis residential construction remains depressed in all of our markets and we are facing volume declines in the commercial sector as well we have implemented cost control measures including capital spending controls throughout the company and are prepared to take further steps depending on the level of construction activity as we progress throughout the year and into 2009 our primary focus for the near term is maximizing cash flow and maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility
1653782 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1653783 im not afraid neither are my colleagues we are used to being in the toughest groups at the world cup
1653784 we carry triumph and ducati bikes two of the biggest european brands
1653785 up front we have the more modern line of triumph the tiger the speed triple the sprint st the new rocket they range from sport touring bikes naked sport bikes cruisers all the way through to the classics like the bonneville
1653786 the ducati line is more geared towards the sport line
1653787 this years version the 696 is a fun riding bike its the lightest bike in its class at about 355 pounds but it puts out a good amount of power thats synonymous with ducati
1653788 then you just hold on because man theyve got some anger behind them
1653789 its hard to stock everything but we can pretty much order anything for anybody
1653790 i started out as a hardcore motorcyclist and a business professional and i spent years traveling around the world as a sales and marketing executive
1653791 after one more merger id been through seven in my career i was over in europe with my wife and i decided that i wanted to do something else
1653792 i said if i could do anything id open up a motorcycle dealership and she said why dont you do it
1653793 one of the only things that i had in my business plan that could truly be catastrophic failure was that if i was unable to get motorcycles from triumph being a one dealer line and thats what happened
1653794 fortunately we heard about that fire early so i literally called up my triumph rep and placed an order of 30 motorcycles and they fulfilled that order which helped carry me through
1653795 having the multiple lines makes us a stronger dealership which is better for our customers as well
1653796 they are super light and small which allows smaller customers particularly women to have a true starter bike that theyll use for a year or two and then grow out of it
1653797 picked up the schwinn line and subsequently the vespa piaggio line
1653798 this is our third season with vespa piaggio and we are literally just about sold out of everything we can get our hands on
1653799 are very concerned about style because they get top quality and style with the vespas
1653800 if i was not on route 1 i was not going to be successful because we had dealerships north and south of us
1653801 we endeavor to build the best service team in the northeast and im fairly confident were most of the way there if not all the way there
1653802 the court of arbitration for sport has upheld the appeals filed by fc schalke 04 sv werder bremen and fc barcelona against the decision issued on 30 july 2008 by the single judge of fifas players status committee that consequently has been set aside in its entirety
1653803 the olympic football tournament beijing 2008 is not included in the co ordinated match calendar and there is no specific decision of the fifa executive committee establishing the obligation for the clubs to release players under 23 for this tournament
1653804 the requirements to justify a legal obligation of clubs to release their players for the football tournament beijing 2008 on the basis of customary law are not met
1653805 in view of fifas recommendation made to the clubs to release their players as well as of the olympic spirit the cas call upon the good will and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country in the olympic games
1653806 the olympic games are being used as a propaganda tool by the chinese government to whitewash their human rights record
1653807 i have invited you to see a movie that a friend asked me to show to you

1653811 we are extremely pleased with this quarters results which again reflect improved earnings for the fourth consecutive quarter we exceeded last years second quarter reported net income by 51 percent and currently expect to significantly exceed this years 1 56 eps employee incentive target
1653812 assuming commodity prices stay at current levels through 2010 together with earnings from our 4 billion capital expansion plan we expect to deliver average annual eps growth of 8 percent that combined with a dividend yield of about 3 5 percent takes our expected total shareholder return over the next several years to more than 10 percent
1653813 while our second quarter results contained some unusual impacts such as a settlement with the internal revenue service on a u s federal income tax audit and the june flooding in our service territory the utility and non regulated operations continue to deliver positive results
1653814 during the second quarter we also signed the largest contract in our companys history securing 500 megawatts of wind turbine generators from vestas american wind technology inc along with our proposed hybrid baseload coal units and energy efficiency programs we expect wind to play an integral part of a plan to meet our customers future energy needs in a manner that balances reliability economics and the environment
1653815 we have decided not to buy any product from traders in jammu and instead buy products directly from other markets like delhi and amritsar
1653816 we will not cooperate with the traders of jammu anymore we are not going to buy any goods from them we have decided to boycott jammu traders
1653817 so i think it is a positive move and an aggressive move
1653818 we need to take 20 wickets and i feel far more comfortable with four fast bowlers and monty panesar doing a job
1653819 i am giving responsibility to my batsmen collingwood is going to bat at five and freddie who i have spoken at great lengths to is happy to bat at six with timmy ambrose coming in at seven and broad i like broad as a player he is a young player and learns quickly and he will bat at eight
1653820 i like steve and he has had some ups and downs but i have an excellent relationship with him and he is back and seems excited about it
1653821 i like to have steve in my team peter moores and i are singing off the same hymn sheet and it is all positive
1653822 i like broady as a player and a bloke he wants to learn and at a yougn age has his game under wraps
1653823 he brings that extra batting and depth at the bottom of the order
1653824 this is a top south africa side they have some fantastic players and what we need to do is get back to where we play cricket
1653825 we have had a good discussion and the thing which came out is the need to play with passion play every single test match as though it is your last and come off knowing you have given it your all
1653826 my son was admitted to lewisham hospital childrens surgical ward in june when he was four weeks old
1653827 it was an absolute shock especially on a childrens ward a surgical ward
1653828 the cleaners didnt seem to have any pride in the job at all
1653829 they had the latest equipment but they werent bothered about moving things to clean underneath them
1653830 i complained to the nhs trust that no action was taken and i have still had no reply
1653831 last december my wife was at kings college hospital giving birth to our son
1653832 the labour was long and continued through the night so i went in search of refreshments to the canteen which was open only for access to vending machines
1653833 i was incredibly surprised to see a large rat doing its rounds
1653834 it was not fazed by my presence it looked like it was an established part of the hospital and knew where it was going as it headed from one part of the canteen to another
1653835 i reported this to the midwife who seemed genuinely shocked but it appeared to be just another let down for her
1653836 as a locum i saw loads of rats at basildon university hospital at the end of 2007
1653837 not many hospitals officials seem be very concerned about the problem
1653838 these need to be locked away inaccessible to rats or the question of food disposal needs to receive more attention
1653839 ive just spent six weeks at the university hospital of wales in cardiff
1653840 during the two weeks after an operation on my spine i was allowed in a wheelchair into the grounds of the hospital
1653841 at pond a mere 10 metres from the main entrance i counted no more than 30 rats running in a 10 minute period
1653842 gazing through the window of my ward i saw many tiny cockroaches wandering about the window frame
1653843 we should really look into the costs of dealing with this problem on a large scale
1653844 we are letting things like this get out of hand
1653845 as one of the richest economies in the world why cant we spend a bit of time and expense in sorting this out
1653846 i stayed for a couple of months in a childrens psychiatric ward a few years ago and there was a flea infestation
1653847 it was not dealt with as the staff were supposed to provide a live specimen for testing i guess nobody issuing that order had ever tried to catch a flea
1653848 every child in there became infested by the scabies mite which burrows around under the skin causing intense itching
1653849 i left the hospital and was told by my gp that the symptoms everybody had were not from
1653850 is that even a product or is it a feature
1653851 i am exploring a number of options and hope that
1653852 i will do whatever it takes to land this plane
1653853 i want a strategy to win in 1 page and the objectives we need to hit each quarter to reach them
1653854 i know he really wants to go and i feel so bad saying this because i really get along with him but he doesnt let me kat and rachel sing he just hates our singing and he goes on about it all the time
1653855 hes lazy doesnt bring anything to the house got a bit of a temper on him as well hes been up for nominations three times hes survived three evictions i live with him hes not funny he is not funny hes not entertaining and hes lazy so why the f is he still in the house i dont understand it at all
1653856 mental exhaustion and frustration caused by having to remember a large number of passwords
1653857 to date 2008 has been a challenging year although second quarter margins improved from first quarter levels unplanned downtime prevented us from fully capitalizing on these higher margin levels despite the downtime we remained profitable for the quarter and we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets among our peers
1653858 regarding our woods cross and navajo expansion and crude flexibility capital projects we continue to make substantial progress in july we announced a pipeline agreement with centurion pipeline l p to deliver heavy canadian crude oil from cushing oklahoma to a point located at slaughter texas we are proceeding with plans to construct a new 70 mile pipeline that will deliver this crude oil to our navajo refinery complex in new mexico also we expect to commence the start up of the woods cross projects early in the fourth quarter and to be capable of operating at full capacity at year end these projects will ultimately help in improving our profitability at both refineries by reducing raw material costs additionally we recently purchased a terminal and rail facility located near cedar city utah that will serve as a key component of our unev joint venture pipeline project
1653859 while cryoablation continues to show clinical equivalency and in some cases superiority to radiation and other treatment options competitive procedures and their associated economics led to some dilution with existing physician customers in the first half of the year a thorough review of our year to date performance including the number and types of cases performed by each of our physician customers suggested that urology prostate cancer cases were impacted primarily by the emergence of robotic prostatectomy and intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt we believe that patient demand for robotics and the current opportunity for greater financial benefits to the physician from imrt have specifically led to that dilution while the growth in non prostate applications continues to show strength the decline in the number of prostate procedures is being addressed in an aggressive manner
1653860 we already have taken steps to help us regain the growth that we have demonstrated in the past these steps include programs intended to impact the number of new physicians trained increase revenues from our existing customers and communicate directly and more broadly with patients to educate them about the significant benefits of cryoablation the programs include additional new urology sales personnel significantly enhanced patient outreach and advertising and programs that assist our existing physician customers in reaching more patients through community based marketing an important element of these programs is an increased emphasis on focal cryoablation since we believe that this is an area where we have a potentially substantial competitive advantage
1653861 with so much interest in digital tv it is easy to forget that the majority of people around the world still watch television using traditional analogue reception the showman range has been available for over a decade and the new db showman 1000 will allow us to supply the world s analogue tv customers using a single product range rather than market specific variants

1653866 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1653867 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1653868 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1653869 todays indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every american faces in the 21st century the fact that each individuals greatest asset is their names their identity

1653879 i was looking after mittu for a friend while he is on holiday
1653880 i have an african grey at home myself and they would have made too much noise together so i decided to keep mittu at the garage
1653881 he could say a few words and would wolf whistle at the ladies when they went past
1653882 mittu is worth anything from 600 to 1 200 i dont understand why the thief has stolen him though as parrots have a really good memory and he will not take to somebody who causes him distress
1653883 i can tell mittu was distressed as he had plucked out a feather and there were seeds and water from his cage all over the floor
1653884 all that was left was this one long feather so i think he must have put up a bit of a struggle
1653885 i havent told my friend he is missing yet as i dont want to ruin his holiday but hopefully we might be able to get him back before he returns
1653886 and now id like to answer some questions if you have any
1653887 after seven and a half years if i cant figure out how to dodge them i shouldnt
1653888 if you dont have any questions i can tell you a lot of interesting stories

1653891 one of the english languages most demanding roles and survives
1653892 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
1653893 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
1653894 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
1653895 it is in our own self interest to be concerned and certainly from a fiscal standpoint we have an interest in times of financial difficulty we have a fixed amount of money and for every dollar we spend on incarceration we have one dollar less to spend on education and other things this is a challenging public policy question
1653896 its an effort to try to stigmatize contraception and family planning
1653897 it should be a clarion call to women and men in this country that a kind of extremist view has begun to take hold to make even birth control and contraception more difficult to secure and that it could lead to the same kind of stigmatization that has existed in the case of abortion

1653900 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1653901 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened

1653950 theyve both been operating pretty aggressively on the liquidity side
1653951 the ecb and the fed have moved to a more similar framework here with the fed having to do more of the motion
1653952 im not convinced it would have been appropriate for the fed to accept whatever came its way as collateral during the worst of times

1653992 the babys grandmother is with the baby in the hospital after the ahmedabad blasts i took the baby along with me and came to jaipur they wanted to take the baby back with them to japan so i went to the japanese embassy for the visa but there they asked to bring the passport and the no objection certificate but being new to this place the babys grandmother could not arrange it till now

1653994 their condition was quite serious when they were brought to us they were not satisfied as they were living in one room then they were separated from each other but now they are living and playing together they look happy and eat properly
1653995 when these bears were with their nomadic masters they were only a means of bread and butter for them this was because the masters were poor and did not have anything to feed the bear the practice to use them for livelihood is banned under the wildlife protection act so the government and the wildlife sos jointly took the initiative and saved them such steps are to be taken in other states as well

1654000 but we are seeing a trend in these type of operations and were very disturbed by this
1654001 these people are getting paid to take good care of these plants

1654008 they have fabricated and sugar coated their case and tolerated any type of distasteful behavior when it serves them
1654009 i just went through there the other day and they are doing some paving so i think they will probably be done
1654010 they havent put the final coat down but they were doing some intermediate paving
1654011 they will get the far west half done first and wont be in town until after the fair
1654012 after speaking with the head of the dive team and talking with the people that were in charge of the cadaver dogs we felt we conducted a complete search of the area and there was nothing there

1654025 had this case waited two or three months going to the grand jury it might have been different
1654026 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
1654027 like just everywhere arms legs neck chest guts wherever he could swing it he got it
1654028 the attacker was over top of the victim continually cutting him i think the victim was gone at that point
1654029 when we came back on the bus it was visible at the end of the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
1654030 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
1654031 i have been waiting for the way in which the mccain campaign would begin to begin to racialize the election
1654032 and i think this is perhaps the beginning of it im not suggesting that mccain is playing the race card at the moment but this is the beginning of a racialized sentiment being infused in the campaign

1654045 che ci sia una relazione molto forte tra la violenza sessuale e il tentato suicidio certo
1654046 la nostra ricerca documenta leffetto diretto dello stupro su ciascuno di tali indicatori di salute
1654047 contrariamente al pregiudizio sociale secondo cui le donne gridano allo stupro quando invece non successo niente

1654075 jordan has always strived to be a leader in education and it and his majesty king abdullah continually stresses his vision for jordan to prosper into an ict and education hub in the region
1654076 the jordanian government microsoft and itg share that same goal with his majesty to enhance education in the kingdom through the adoption of e learning solutions such as eduwave live and providing educational services to the world
1654077 i believe that such an educational platform will benefit students teachers parents administrators and the educational community as a whole
1654078 eduwave live is the result of a strategic partnership between microsoft and itg it is a combination of the power and comprehensiveness of eduwave in education and the strength of microsofts platform and breadth of its capabilities for delivering the next generation of computing
1654079 eduwave live is part of the learning gateway initiative which enables schools and local and regional educational authorities to get the most from existing investments in technologies a very important aspect of this project is the investment that is being made in an e learning platform developed by a local jordanian partner which demonstrates microsofts continued support for the innovative products developed by our partners and our commitment to introduce eduwave live across the region
1654080 microsoft and its partners strongly support jordan and his majestys initiative of being an ict education hub in the region
1654081 we are extremely proud of our strategic partnership with microsoft eduwave live will most definitely bring great benefits to the educational sector and we believe that together with microsoft we can take this advanced solution to many countries around the world
1654082 eduwave live is consistent with microsofts software plus services approach for the next generation of computing which brings together the best of cloud based services such as software hosted off premise and the software that resides on a world of devices such as pcs servers and mobile phones
1654083 the software plus services vision will provide seamless experiences for individuals and information workers organizations will have the choice and flexibility of how and where to deploy and manage their infrastructure and line of business applications

1654120 labour have said over and over that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
1654121 in countries with good standards of healthcare the possibility for insects or pests to transmit infections in hospitals would be very remote
1654122 in the uk wounds are treated appropriately and dressings applied to ensure good hygiene and prevent infection
1654123 how can patients be safe amid bedbugs fleas and rats these findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent
1654124 if these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business
1654125 clearly it may be necessary to take action against pests in these large public buildings from time to time
1654126 however it is important for hospital trusts to have robust procedures in place to deal with any pest problems
1654127 the hygiene code requires nhs bodies to have a pest control policy that anticipates and manages this issue
1654128 trusts should take rapid action and follow through with surveillance in place to avoid pest incidents and minimize hazards

1654143 janganlah engkau masuk ke dalam suatu daerah yang sedang terjangkit wabah dan bila dirimu berada di dalamnya janganlah pergi meninggalkannya
1654144 sesungguhnya allah hanya mengharamkan bagimu bangkai darah daging babi dan binatang yang ketika disembelih disebut nama selain allah tetapi barangsiapa dalam keadaan terpaksa memakannya sedang dia tidak menginginkannya dan tidak pula melampaui batas maka tidak ada dosa baginya sesungguhnya allah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
1654145 apa saja nikmat yang kamu peroleh adalah dari allah dan apa saja bencana yang menimpamu maka dari kesalahan dirimu sendiri kami mengutusmu menjadi rasul kepada segenap manusia dan cukuplah allah menjadi saksi

1654152 sesungguhnya orang orang mukmin adalah bersaudara karena itu damaikanlah antara kedua saudaramu dan bertaqwalah kepada allah supaya kamu mendapat rahmat

1654219 while it is rather rash to make detailed prophecies it is i think fairly clear that in future a human body from the moment of conception will not be regarded merely as something which must be left to grow in accordance with natural forces with no human interference beyond what is required for the preservation of health the tendency of scientific technique is to cause everything to be regarded as not just a brute datum but raw material for the carrying out of some human purpose the child and even the embryo will come to be viewed more and more in this way as the mentality connected with scientific technique becomes more dominant in this as in all other forms of scientific power there are possibilities of good and possibilities of evil science alone will not decide which is to prevail
1654220 science when it has once acquired a firm hold upon social organization is hardly likely to stop short at those biological aspects of human life which have hitherto been left to the joint guidance of religion and instinct we may i think assume that both the quantity and the quality of the population will be carefully regulated by the state but that sexual intercourse apart from children will be regarded as a private matter so long as it is not allowed to interfere with work as regards quantity the state statisticians will determine as carefully as they can whether the population of the world at the moment is above or below the number which leads to the greatest material comfort per head they will also take account of all such changes of technique as can be foreseen no doubt the usual rule will be to aim at a stationary population but if some important invention such as artificial food should greatly cheapen the production of necessaries an increase of population might for a time be thought wise i shall however assume that in normal times the world government will decree a stationary population if we were right in supposing that the scientific society will have different social grades according to the kind of work to be performed we may assume also that it will have uses for human beings who are not of the highest grade of intelligence it is probable that there will be certain kinds of labour mainly performed by negroes and that manual workers in general will be bred for patience and muscle rather than for brains the governors and experts on the contrary will be bred chiefly for their intellectual powers and their strength of character assuming that both kinds of breeding are scientifically carried out there will come to be an increasing divergence between the two types making them in the end almost different species scientific breeding in any truly scientific form would at present encounter insuperable obstacles both from religion and from sentiment to carry it out scientifically it would be necessary as among domestic animals to employ only a small percentage of males for purposes of breeding it may be thought that religion and sentiment will always succeed in opposing an immovable veto to such a system i wish i could think so but i believe that sentiment is quite extraordinarily plastic and that the individualistic religion to which we have been accustomed is likely to be increasingly replaced by a religion of devotion to the state among russian communists this has already happened in any case what is demanded is scarcely as difficult a control of natural impulses as is involved in the celibacy of the catholic priesthood wherever remarkable achievements are possible and are at the same time such as to satisfy mens moral idealism the love of power is capable of swallowing up the instinctive life of the affections especially if an outlet is permitted to purely physical sexual impulses traditional religion which has been violently dispossessed in russia will suffer a setback everywhere if the russian experiment proves successful in any case its outlook is difficult to reconcile with that of industrialism and scientific technique traditional religion was based upon a sense of mans impotence in the face of natural forces whereas scientific technique induces a sense of the impotence of natural forces in the face of mans intelligence combined with this sense of power a certain degree of austerity in regard to the softer pleasures is quite natural one sees it already in many of those who are creating the mechanistic society of the future in america this austerity has taken the form of protestant piety in russia of devotion to communism i think therefore that there is hardly any limit to the departures from traditional sentiment which science may introduce into the question of reproduction if the simultaneous regulation of quantity and quality is taken seriously in the future we may expect that in each generation some 25 per cent of women and some 5 per cent of men will be selected to be the parents of the next generation while the remainder of the population will be sterilized which will in no way interfere with their sexual pleasures but will merely render these pleasures destitute of social importance the women who are selected for breeding will have to have eight or nine children each but will not be expected to perform any other work except the suckling of the children for a suitable number of months no obstacles will be placed upon their relations with sterile men or upon the relations of sterile men and women with each other but reproduction will be regarded as a matter which concerns the state and will not be left to the free choice of the persons concerned perhaps it will be found that artificial impregnation is more certain and less embarrassing since it will obviate the need of any personal contact between the father and mother of the prospective child sentiments of personal affection may still be connected with intercourse not intended to be fruitful while impregnation will be regarded in an entirely different manner more in the light of a surgical operation so that it will be thought not ladylike to have it performed in the natural manner the qualities for which parents will be chosen will differ greatly according to the status which it is hoped the child will occupy in the governing class a considerable degree of intelligence will be demanded of parents perfect health will of course be indispensable so long as gestation is allowed to persist to its natural period mothers will also have to be selected by their capacity for easy delivery and will therefore have to be free from an unduly narrow pelvis it is probable however that as time goes on the period of gestation will be shortened and that later months of foetal development will take place in an incubator this would also free mothers from the need of suckling their children and would thus make maternity a not very onerous matter the care of infants intended to belong to the governing class would seldom be left to the mothers mothers would be selected by their eugenic qualities and these would not necessarily be the qualities required in a nurse on the other hand the early months of pregnancy might be more burdensome than at present since the foetus would be subjected to various kinds of scientific treatment intended to affect beneficially not only its own characteristics but those of its possible descendants fathers would of course have nothing to do with their own children there would be in general only one father to every five mothers and it is quite likely that he would never have even seen the mothers of his children the sentiment of paternity would thus disappear completely probably in time the same thing would happen though to a slightly less degree in regard to mothers if birth were prematurely induced and the child separated from its mother at birth maternal sentiment would have little chance to develop
1654221 among the workers it is probable that less elaborate care would be taken since it is easier to breed for muscle than to breed for brains and it is not unlikely that women would be allowed to bring up their own children in the old fashioned natural manner there would not be among the workers the same need as among the governors for fanatical devotion to the state and there would not be therefore on the part of the government the same jealousy of the private affections among the governors one must suppose all private sentiments would be viewed with suspicion a man and woman who showed any ardent devotion to each other would be regarded as they are at present regarded by moralists when they are not married there would be professional nurses in cr ches and professional teachers in nursery schools but they would be considered to be failing in their duty if they felt any special affection for special children children who showed any special affection for a particular adult would be separated form that adult ideas of this kind are already widespread they will be found suggested for example in dr john b watsons book on education the tendency of the scientific manipulator is to regard all private affections as unfortunate freudians have shown us that they are the sources of complexes administrators realize that they stand in the way of a whole hearted devotion to business the church sanctioned certain kinds of love while condemning others but the modern ascetic is more thoroughgoing and condemns all kinds of love equally as mere folly and waste of time
1654222 what should we expect of the mental make up of people in such a world the manual workers may i think be fairly happy one may assume that the rulers will be successful in making the manual workers foolish and frivolous work will not be too severe and there will be endless amusements of a trivial sort owing to sterilization love affairs need not have awkward consequences so long as they are not between a man and woman who are both of them unsterilized in this way a life of easygoing and frivolous pleasure may be provided for the manual workers combined of course with a superstitious reverence for the governors instilled in childhood and prolonged by the propaganda to which adults will be exposed the psychology of the governors will be a more difficult matter they will be expected to display an arduous and hard working devotion to the ideal of the scientific state and to sacrifice to this ideal all the softer sentiments such as love of wife and children friendships between fellow workers whether of the same or of different sexes will tend to become ardent and will not infrequently overstep the limits which the public moralists will have fixed in such a case the authorities will separate the friends unless in doing so they will interrupt some important research or administrative undertaking when for some such public reason friends are not separated they will be admonished by means of governmental microphones the censors will listen in to their conversations and if these should at any time become tinged with sentiment disciplinary measures will be adopted all the deeper feelings will be frustrated with the sole exception of devotion to science and the state the governors will of course have their amusements for leisure hours i do not see how art or literature could flourish in such a world nor do i think that the emotions from which they spring and to which they appeal would meet with governmental approval but athletics of a strenuous kind will be encouraged among the young of the governing class and dangerous sports will be considered valuable as a training in those habits of mind and body by which authority over the manual workers will be maintained love making among the sterilized will be subjected to no restrictions either of law or of public opinion but it will be casual and temporary involving none of the deeper feelings and no serious affection persons suffering from unendurable boredom will be encouraged to ascend mount everest or fly over the south pole but the need for such distractions will be regarded as a sign of mental or physical ill health in such a world though there may be pleasure there will be no joy the result will be a type displaying the usual characteristics of vigorous ascetics they will be harsh and unbending tending towards cruelty in their ideals and their readiness to consider that the infliction of pain is necessary for he public good i do not imagine that pain will be much inflicted as punishment for sin since no sin will be recognized except insubordination and failure to carry out the purposes of the state it is more probable that the sadistic impulses which the asceticism will generate will find their outlet in scientific experiment the advancement of knowledge will be held to justify much torture of individuals by surgeons biochemists and experimental psychologist as time goes on the amount of added knowledge required to justify a given amount of pain will diminish and the number of governors attracted to the kinds of research necessitating cruel experiments will increase just as the sun worship of the aztecs demanded the painful death of thousands of human beings annually so the new scientific religion will demand its holocausts of sacred victims gradually the world will grow more dark and more terrible strange perversions of instinct will first lurk in the dark corners and then gradually overwhelm the men in high places sadistic pleasures will not suffer the moral condemnation that will be meted out to the softer joys since like the persecutions of the inquisition they will be found in harmony with the prevailing asceticism in the end such a system must break down either in an orgy of bloodshed or in the rediscovery of joy such at least is the only ray of hope to lighten the darkness of these visions of cassandra but perhaps in permitting this ray of hope we have allowed ourselves to yield to a foolish optimism perhaps by means of injections and drugs and chemicals the population could be induced to bear whatever its scientific masters may decide to be for its good new forms of drunkenness involving no subsequent headache may be discovered and new forms of intoxication may be invented so delicious that for their sakes these are possibilities in a world governed by knowledge without love and power without delight the man drunk with power is destitute of wisdom and so long as he rules the world the world will be a place devoid of beauty and of joy
1654223 take again such a matter as housing in england individualism leads most families to prefer a small house of their own rather than an apartment in a large house the result is that the suburbs of london are spread out through mile after mile of dreariness to the immense detriment of the women and children each housewife cooks an abominable dinner at great expenditure of labour for an infuriated husband the children when they come home from school or while they are too young to go to school find themselves cooped up in small stuffy premises where either they are a nuisance to their parents or their parents are a nuisance to them in a more sensible community each family would occupy a part of an immense building with a courtyard in the middle there would be no individual cooking but only communal meals children as soon as they were no longer at the breast would spend their day in large airy halls under the care of women possessing the knowledge the training and the temperament required for making young children happy the wives who at present drudge all day doing wasteful work badly would be set free to earn their living outside the home the benefit of such a system to the mothers and still more to the children would be incalculable at the rachel macmillan nursery school it was found that about 90 per cent of the children had rickets when they first came and almost all were cured at the end of the first year in the school in the ordinary home the necessary modicum of light and air and good food cannot be provided whereas all these things can be provided quite cheaply if they are provided for many children at once the freedom to cause ones children to grow up stunted and crippled on the ground that one is too fond of them to part with them is a freedom which is certainly not in the public interest

1654284 in the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for in our extended package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive
1654285 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps

1654293 a google computer can do the work of a thousand agents the money we save by doing our cmas in 5 seconds we can pass on to home buyers our google computer agents gcas dont need as much gas as the traditional agent either our budget for e o insurance is less for computer agents too
1654294 we only wanted to be a real estate search engine working with brokers providing them with free exposure of their properties and free advertising the nars victory forced us to become a real estate broker in all 900 mlss and to actively sell real estate we didnt want this we really didnt want to do this but the nar made us do it

1654299 q 2 its up to the homeowner to prove the assessor wrong do you think thats a fair way to go about it
1654300 q 3 what advice do you have for someone who wants to challenge their assessment

1654310 based on initial information it seems that group of generals are holding the prime minister
1654311 labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
1654312 it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infestations is concerning
1654313 we need greater transparency in nhs infection control and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards
1654314 pests are attracted to most buildings whether they are in the private or public sector you are likely to see pests at some point in some form or another
1654315 there is a problem with large buildings like hospitals in particular and many buildings with a lot of grounds are also attacked
1654316 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1654317 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1654318 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised

1654323 when feedback is withdrawn the positive negative or neutral rating associated with that feedback comment will no longer show or count in your feedback score however the feedback comment itself will remain its still always a good idea to try and resolve trading issues before leaving a negative feedback whenever possible

1654329 for years members have asked us why we dont retire old feedback that has lost its relevance especially old negatives
1654330 ebay pioneered online reputation systems with the feedback system back in the 90s and since then our members have loved to debate its merits the fact is its a great system but it needs some refinement to keep pace with our marketplace today i announced feedback 2 0 which well be launching in pilot markets next month feedback 2 0 will add a new dimension to the current system allowing buyers to rate transactions on item description communication shipping time and shipping amp handling charges the average of each of the detailed seller ratings is displayed on the sellers feedback profile page its a simple system that rewards sellers by recognizing and spotlighting the things they do to ensure customer satisfaction well share more about feedback 2 0 in the coming weeks so stay tuned

1654334 es sah einfach so aus als w rden wir gar nicht anwesend sein
1654335 weder robert noch nick konnten zu irgendeinem zeitpunkt die rundenzeiten aus der qualifikation erreichen und ich muss zugeben dass ich den grund bis jetzt nicht verstehe
1654336 in bestimmten rennphasen war er sogar das langsamste auto auf der strecke was im rennen passierte war v llig unerwartet
1654337 was im rennen geschah hatte mit den fahrern nichts zu tun
1654338 da muss es eine andere erkl rung geben wir waren nicht nur langsam wir waren auch nicht konstant und wie bei ferrari haben auch wir gesehen dass ein auto besser als das andere war
1654339 we agree it was rather high for the time of year its possible mr purdey has been charged for the gas used up during the explosion that destroyed his house
1654340 have you any idea where george got these cigars from
1654341 theres half a chance that i might by now have done at least a little authentic growing up
1654342 it isnt customary in such moments to express anything but praise about the deceased but some of his articles did have an element of xenophobia
1654343 against the backdrop of a strongly negative attitude towards migrants including armenians this only poured oil on the flames of russian chauvinism in todays russia
1654344 on the one hand he was considered one of the main defeaters of stalinist tyranny in russia on the other hand for us he was a guardian of the russian empire his power to criticize and denounce put solzhenitsyn on par with lev tolstoi but in his famous work rebuilding russia for example he strove to preserve russia as an empire with the fame he enjoyed he could have tried to defend not only russians but other ethnic groups as well
1654345 he wrote a long article saying that russia has to be a separate state that it has to kick out the other 14 republics he wrote that the republics were russias underbelly meaning that russia was feeding them and would prosper if they were discarded
1654346 gross intervention in the internal affairs of an independent state
1654347 i realized that mr solzhenitsyn was a common russian imperialist despite the fact that he had lashed out at the totalitarian system with such force i saw it as a terrible contradiction because any imperialistic system is to a certain extent totalitarian i saw that solzhenitsyn was hugely contradictory in denying belarusians and ukrainians the right to determine their fate
1654348 after receiving the nobel prize solzhenitsyn deteriorated he switched from the great challenge of combating the evil empire to russian imperial issues he fell not only in our esteem his international image also deteriorated each of his words was closely monitored and sparked disenchantment after disenchantment
1654349 ukraine is a separate topic since solzhenitsyn whose mother was ukrainian had a particular attitude toward ukraine he sought to reject his ukrainian half and uphold his russian nationalist half in this sense he lost his stature he joined the very narrow reactionary and primitive world of russian imperial ideology his speeches on ukraine were horrid they were wrong they were full of false information the kind of information that russian society is being fed
1654350 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1654351 it will be used as more propaganda by the taliban was more evidence that afghans are not getting anything from the international mission
1654352 by and large these are not run to identify spies they are run to thwart what the officer is trying to do to us and to learn more about what they are trying to do to us
1654353 it can also pay off enormously in intelligence as in football an offense can be the best defense
1654354 wir haben uns f r incor entschieden da das system ideal f r die langzeit anwendung geeignet ist und sich gut in den alltag des patienten einf gt gerade f r patienten die lange auf ein spenderherz warten m ssen oder eine dauerhafte herzunterst tzung ben tigen sind das entscheidende kriterien

1654358 that intersection has flooded all my life but with the new drainage project kicked in it didnt flood
1654359 in terms of feedstock we do have a supply of crude in tanks that will enable us to continue running for the foreseeable future
1654360 we had very little rain and a breeze of 5 to 10 mph
1654361 weve had worse thunderstorms than this like the squall that came through sunday night
1654362 the court of arbitration for sport cas has upheld the appeals filed by schalke 04 werder bremen and barcelona against the decision issued on july 30 2008 by the single judge of fifas players status committee that consequently has been set aside in its entirety
1654363 beijing 2008 is not included in the co ordinated match calendar and there is no specific decision of the fifa executive committee establishing the obligation for the clubs to release players under 23 for this tournament the requirements to justify a legal obligation of clubs to release their players for the olympics on the basis of customary law are not met
1654364 in view of fifas recommendation made to the clubs to release their players as well as of the olympic spirit cas calls upon the good will and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country in the olympic games
1654365 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1654366 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1654367 weve been so dry flooding hasnt been much of an issue
1654368 were prepared to identify problems identify resources and supply those resources if needed
1654369 inilah waktu yang tepat bagi bollywood karena pintu telah terbuka untuk keluar ke dunia global kesempatannya sangat besar
1654370 salah satu hal yang akan kami tanamkan pada saat pembekalan adalah bagaimana mereka bisa mengenalkan produk wisata dan produk industri dalam negeri misalnya batik jamu dan berbagai produk wisata lainnya ke dunia internasional
1654371 ini juga sejalan dengan program pemerintah tentang kebangkitan jamu indonesia
1654372 terpikir juga sih untuk mempromosikan jamu di tingkat miss universe dengan cara menjadi sponsor kegiatannya tapi mungkin dimulainya pada penyelenggaraan tahun 2009 ya
1654373 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him

1654377 i think the bbfc do very good and important work but i was surprised having seen and enjoyed the dark knight that it was a 12a and not a 15
1654378 the film contains violent and disturbing scenes even though its a brilliant movie we should remember that bbfc classifications are only advisory and local authorities are ultimately responsible for classifications it would be interesting to see if any local authorities wish to use their powers for this and future films
1654379 you do not see any blood or injury in detail
1654380 if we had given this a 12 there would be complaints from parents about 14 year olds not be allowed to see the film
1654381 i think the bbfc do very good and important work but i was surprised having seen and enjoyed the dark knight that it was a 12a and not a 15

1654385 the army remains committed to thoroughly investigate and take appropriate action in all unrestricted reports of sexual assault
1654386 continues its commitment to eradicate sexual assault in the military services
1654387 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
1654388 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
1654389 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
1654390 i think its wrong to allow adoptions of children by gay and lesbian couples
1654391 i still think that there ought to be ways for us to provide a loving environment for children without sending a wrong message to them early or a message that we have to sit down and try to explain some psychological damage or emotional damage or something later on in life
1654392 i think that lesbianism and homosexuality is morally wrong and the laws supposed to discriminate sometimes
1654393 my values have remained constant and consistent for the last 20 years the ones who are most harping about the political party change are those who feel the most threatened by it to me its a little disingenuous to try and attack me only on that
1654394 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u

1654397 the chinese have done some seismic testing but no drilling
1654398 our figures show that some non food goods including electricals and clothing are cheaper than they were a year ago both food and non food prices are going up more slowly than gas or petrol bills overall food prices are rising but retailers are keeping increases well below the extra supply and operating costs they face oil and some world food commodities such as wheat and soya provide hope but most retail costs remain sharply up on a year ago and are still rising
1654399 while shop prices continue to be pushed up primarily by high food prices the bank of england will also note that non food prices edged up year on year for a second month running in july after extended falls
1654400 this will maintain concern that retailers are increasingly trying to pass on their elevated costs at least the year on year rise in non food prices was less than in june and is only marginal
1654401 principally that our content is not web compatible in so far as web users dont respond to 25 000 words and 80 images the point of
1654402 but next to me is my laptop and when i want more background on the players in the book i look them up on the web
1654403 we have made no attempt to put the whole book online most magazines have a staff of over a hundred and come out weekly we are properly compared with both of which have more than one member of staff i would judge our web in a year
1654404 as time goes by i think our visual presence will be much stronger than our competitors i think it will be one of the places to go to for photography on the web but that takes time and we dont have too much of that
1654405 the point is that this is a small operation paying for original content and we have to monetise it somehow giving it away on the web would probably not be smart at this stage in our evolution especially as it is not an appropriate platform on which to read our content
1654406 i dont care if everyone else runs off the street and im the only one standing
1654407 lets get something straight new york is not facing a fiscal crisis
1654408 back on offense which is obviously where you want to be
1654409 we are pleased that the plaintiff in this lawsuit voluntarily moved the court to dismiss taser international from this litigation
1654410 a dismissal with prejudice prevents any future re filings of this litigation against taser international taser internationals products have been scientifically proven to be generally safe and effective once the scientific facts are presented it is extremely difficult to prove otherwise
1654411 most of the policies that have come since globalization have not been farmer friendly
1654412 weve been told you have to push people off the farm that that is the solution
1654413 three fifths of the land area we now call china is historically the home of people who are not ethnically chinese
1654414 we think theres an overlap between the seed savers who are making sure we save our plant biodiversity and those of us that are making sure that cultures survive our way of talking about that is through food
1654415 wed really like to do a book about sorghum and millet
1654416 theyd boil bones theyd hand pull noodles and put them in the broth and then put it on a platter and put the bones on top so then i get home and im like o k bones and noodles
1654417 my youth began when i was twenty one at least thats when i decided it began that was when i started to think that all those shiny things in life some of them might possibly be for me
1654418 were the first generation to leave what we know out of choice not for economic reasons but to think about following our dreams

1654423 this is the single largest and most complex identify theft case ever charged in this country
1654424 simply driving around with a car with a laptop computer looking for accessible wireless computer networks
1654425 it is remarkable in fact that such large well established corporations could be so vulnerable basically to a small group of criminals
1654426 a lot of companies dont have competent people that understand data security there is no such thing as 100 security but that doesnt mean we should throw up our hands and say whats the use we can get a long way by applying appropriate technologies
1654427 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1654428 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1654429 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1654430 it was important for us that there be a clear voice speaking out against the chinese governments abuse of human rights
1654431 its so shocking being an american to see the blatant oppression
1654432 das problem ist heute weniger das aufsp ren der p dophilen als vielmehr die kontrolle ber sie wenn sie das gef ngnis verlassen
1654433 i want everyone to go into this with their eyes wide open
1654434 while some have written palm drive off many many years ago we are still there
1654435 it is not a bailout it is a short term bridge to the future
1654436 the parcel tax will stay in place till all debts are paid off
1654437 it is not the same old palm drive that is doing the same old things and is constantly struggling
1654438 my concern is that the health insurance choices will drive them to the kaiser plan and away from plans that support district hospitals
1654439 there are ripple effects that will affect the smaller hospitals
1654440 there is no evidence that we are pushing people into kaiser
1654441 helping out the hospital has public benefits but it also is a risk if folks look at us like a bank
1654442 ive always wanted to come to the sonoma county fair plant sale
1654443 based on the context of the entire label we agree that the phrase in question refers to the brand name of the product and does not mislead consumers
1654444 i think the students really enjoy having a learning experience that is directly related to an interest area
1654445 the idea is that every student is in a community where they are known well
1654446 its more meaningful for students when there is a connection
1654447 how does mathematics relate to this topic and where is math in this topic its connected instead of isolated
1654448 with smart on the ballot it seemed the right thing to do
1654449 even with our local budget outlook we cannot afford to derail smart we must all work together to ensure passage in both counties thats why healdsburg is willing to sacrifice this november
1654450 the only problem is that my feet hurt i spent seven days on that mountain it was hard it was terrible
1654451 this accident is a very sad and disastrous event in our mountaineering history
1654452 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1654453 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank
1654454 yes there are problems but that does not mean those problems are going to continue
1654455 in all developing countries you put objectives and sometimes you dont reach them
1654456 they are determined to spend this money on development they see it as a priority
1654457 there may have been people who said this is going to be harder than you think this is going to take a long time but nobody said what we should do is collect a lot of money and let it sit there
1654458 i think some people would contend that because we have continued to make a sizable investment there hasnt been a proper incentive until now for the iraqi government to make its own investment
1654459 we badly need a policy we dont need a bad policy which i think we have
1654460 the majority of the korean people have been eagerly awaiting your visit

1654491 the underground economy is a global economy and there are hot spots like china and eastern europe
1654492 it is a full distribution channel with people who steal the data resell the data and use the data

1654501 i think the bbfc do very good and important work but i was surprised having seen and enjoyed the dark knight that it was a 12a and not a 15
1654502 the film contains violent and disturbing scenes even though its a brilliant movie we should remember that bbfc classifications are only advisory and local authorities are ultimately responsible for classifications it would be interesting to see if any local authorities wish to use their powers for this and future films

1654515 our figures show that some non food goods including electricals and clothing are cheaper than they were a year ago both food and non food prices are going up more slowly than gas or petrol bills overall food prices are rising but retailers are keeping increases well below the extra supply and operating costs they face oil and some world food commodities such as wheat and soya provide hope but most retail costs remain sharply up on a year ago and are still rising
1654516 while shop prices continue to be pushed up primarily by high food prices the bank of england will also note that non food prices edged up year on year for a second month running in july after extended falls
1654517 this will maintain concern that retailers are increasingly trying to pass on their elevated costs at least the year on year rise in non food prices was less than in june and is only marginal

1654567 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature
1654568 the rwandan government asks competent authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice
1654569 er hat sie sehr geliebt er war sehr anh nglich hat auch mit ihr geschmust
1654570 die haben sich sehr gut verstanden die hatten ein enges verh ltnis so wie ein ganz normaler enkel zu seiner oma
1654571 this is all about engaging with the community which is something the army were traditionally known for but which has perhaps fallen by the wayside a little in recent years for the simple reason that most soldiers have been away on deployment for long periods
1654572 we want to try and reconnect with people and show them what the army stands for the kind of leadership we can provide but it is not a recruitment drive
1654573 we have chosen a story that is not about the army directly but which highlights the core values we believe are important
1654574 people will often judge the military because they have a political reaction to a conflict and they pass that on to the military who are not political they are just doing a very important job
1654575 we want to show the positive values we believe in such as overcoming adversity and showing courage and loyalty
1654576 i remember smacking someone with a glass i dont know why im a total muppet
1654577 its a worry for patients who will be the ones who suffer if something goes wrong
1654578 doctors should not be working excessive hours we want the scottish government to supply highly trained doctors and enough of them so they are not harassed when they are trying to meet targets
1654579 health boards should be telling the scottish government that there are not enough doctors they must have figured out that more need to be trained up
1654580 nhs lothian has made good progress every year in reducing junior doctors hours in order to meet the european working time regulation and we are currently ahead of most health boards in scotland
1654581 we are working towards ensuring all members of staff meet the 48 hour limit by next august and are on target to meet this
1654582 one of the areas where we are not complying is our transplant surgery rota these are committed members of staff who feel they have to work these hours to provide a service to transplant patients
1654583 most of the retrieval of organs takes place in evenings and at weekends and operations mainly start very early in the morning
1654584 these doctors and nhs lothian realise that we must meet the european working time regulation in order to offer a safe service
1654585 this will involve potentially recruiting additional members of staff rearranging staff rotas and ensuring that all members of staff take their full rest entitlement
1654586 hours have been steadily coming down from the mid 90s when they were 100 hours a week average
1654587 it is unforgivable to leave so many children of that age in tears those kids should have been entertained people had come from all over scotland to see this show
1654588 i was given a refund and complimentary tickets one woman was told she would be sent a cheque but no tickets and one didnt get anything at all it all seemed a bit unfair
1654589 were working with c venues to find out why todays performance was oversold
1654590 this venue like many other university buildings has been hired by a production company during the fringe festival we will be working with the production company involved to establish how this happened
1654591 im sick of these people many of whom arent even from the area hanging around a main entrance to shops and a swimming pool
1654592 why should grannies doing their shopping and mothers taking their kids to the swimming pool have to see these derelicts drink themselves into oblivion
1654593 some people can hardly believe how many people just stand there and drink when it is raining they even do it under umbrellas its good to see that this tactic has worked and it has to be continued until they get the message and start drinking in their own homes
1654594 it does seem to be working we knew over the summer there would be an increase in children using the swimming pool and it had to be addressed
1654595 the public toilet in particular is a popular place for people in pursuit of drugs to meet and greet then go in to exchange them
1654596 i wouldnt say this foot patrols is an old fashioned tactic because we have always done it
1654597 you cant beat good old fashioned policing it always works people say there arent enough of them on the streets but i think its more they dont have enough powers to command respect
1654598 as a community we really welcome what they have done there and it has made a difference
1654599 the overspend in 2007 8 was largely a result of under investment and because demand for services has increased
1654600 an additional 2 2m was needed to deliver care at home services for older people this was addressed by allocating additional money in this years budget
1654601 another contribution to the overspend can be attributed to one off events such as the governments free personal care policy over 1m had to be reimbursed for meal preparation charges which were wrongly charged based on government guidance
1654602 we are facing huge demographic pressures and it is vital we shift the balance of care towards supporting people in their own homes for longer this was reflected in our budget
1654603 cllr paul edie has written in a departmental magazine saying that he is starting 2008 9 with a clean sheet hes actually starting with a 5m overspend that he was in charge of
1654604 i dont see how this wont have an effect on frontline services this money has to be found from somewhere
1654605 more and more people need these services but the money isnt there
1654606 if were honest leith walk has been in a bit of a state because of the trams and i think it would be good to see someone co ordinating efforts to rejuvenate the area
1654607 it is simply a case of trying to get some joined up thinking and having someone to champion leith as a destination for shoppers but also trying to get some of the empty shop units filled
1654608 i would envisage the money from this coming out of ties budget but longer term we could be looking at a town manger type role for leith
1654609 anything that can benefit the people and traders of leith has to be welcomed i dont think people realise that it will take some time for leith to recover from all of the disruption from the tram works
1654610 people do get out of the habit of visiting places or taking certain routes around the city so we do need someone to remind everyone that we are still here and very much open
1654611 this is an interesting idea having a person who can pull together all the different interests of leith will be really useful but also someone who can work through the remaining tram works and make it as pain free as possible would also be helpful
1654612 at the moment no housebuilders can get hold of the cash they are not interested in looking at any development because of the mortgage market and the bank lending isnt available for them
1654613 with housing associations their bank debt is arranged over a much larger time period and they do have funding available now
1654614 the big difference is that this will deliver housing where it is needed
1654615 there is going to be pressure on sales and mortgages for the next year or two and if we see any opportunities to provide affordable housing then it will be a great benefit for the city
1654616 the current credit crunch has deepened edinburghs housing crisis we are very glad to receive innovative proposals for new affordable housing as with our own recently announced plans to build the first council homes for a generation this plan supports research showing that such communities are by far the most successful
1654617 we are aware of reports of two british nationals being detained near the national stadium in beijing
1654618 we are in touch with the chinese authorities and are requesting immediate consular access should this information be correct
1654619 ill probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country but i believe its not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living under the occupation of the chinese government
1654620 for years the chinese government has tried to use the olympics to legitimise its illegal occupation of tibet
1654621 at this very moment tibetans are facing the most severe and violent repression they have seen in decades at the hands of the chinese government and we have taken non violent action at this critical time to draw the worlds attention to the crisis gripping tibet
1654622 we were sitting watching the show and about half an hour into it there was a crashing noise from above because it was dark we didnt know what it was and a split second later something came out of nowhere and crashed on to her
1654623 she screamed straight away and didnt stop screaming until after we got to the hospital we werent sure where the cut was to begin with because there was a lot of blood it was horrible seeing my own daughter like that
1654624 we were inspected before the start of the fringe and this has just been an unfortunate accident
1654625 obviously we kept in touch with the family of the little girl and we sent her a big bouquet of flowers it was great to hear that she is all right and we would be delighted to welcome her back to see any show here
1654626 its put me off no more fringe for me just now

1654706 he had the super duper sinker going he was just outstanding
1654707 i just went out there and tried to focus on the mitt as much as possible and keep my mind down in the zone i came in here knowing that they were probably going to take pitches on me because im a rookie coming into a big stadium so i really tried to pound the zone
1654708 thats great nine years of frustration and he took it out on the best team in baseball
1654709 you cant expect the team to go out and put up five or 10 runs every game youve got to get a break in there at some point
1654710 i think the consensus of opinion was that he wasnt given an adequate opportunity to prepare himself to come here
1654711 i dont care how much of a scouting report you have when you step in the box the ball is moving its different than words
1654712 he didnt throw the offspeed stuff until the second time around he threw all fastballs and one changeup the first time around he knew what he was doing

1654740 if youre within terms you can pick up oil and if youre not you can pound salt
1654741 and thats just the way it is i hope we never get to that point and have to deal with our customers that way but thats the way it is on the other side of our business
1654742 they may be buying oil at a higher price than they can sell it for or more likely the customer simply cant afford to buy it
1654743 so now they have oil they have to pay for and they cant get rid of
1654744 i think that they understand that were the middleman in this

1654761 this is a great opportunity to coach at international level
1654762 as well as developing my coaching skills its an exciting opportunity to gain firsthand knowledge on the best young players coming through the system
1654763 training alongside the senior team will help create a consistency of playing style between the teams and give the players the best possible opportunity to step up the highest level
1654764 i hope to provide a clear pathway for the players currently playing in the guinness premiership who will become englands future internationals not only those in the saxons squad but also those who have just missed out or have stepped out of the england u20s and have potential for the future

1654769 but we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws

1654780 from what ive been told from the hotel the public security bureau showed up at midnight and told them our specific event had to be canceled for safety reasons without going into any specifics

1654786 the more ive heard about what happens to the animals fur ripped off them when theyre still alive its heart breaking

1654805 our figures show that some non food goods including electricals and clothing are cheaper than they were a year ago both food and non food prices are going up more slowly than gas or petrol bills overall food prices are rising but retailers are keeping increases well below the extra supply and operating costs they face oil and some world food commodities such as wheat and soya provide hope but most retail costs remain sharply up on a year ago and are still rising
1654806 while shop prices continue to be pushed up primarily by high food prices the bank of england will also note that non food prices edged up year on year for a second month running in july after extended falls
1654807 this will maintain concern that retailers are increasingly trying to pass on their elevated costs at least the year on year rise in non food prices was less than in june and is only marginal

1654825 the last time we had a high temperature below 81 degrees was on may 17 when the high was 74
1654826 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1654827 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1654828 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1654829 they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee
1654830 i understand that about 200 of our athletes received those masks through the national governing body not directly from the u s olympic committee
1654831 it provides a sustainable solution for legal downloads of licensed music
1654832 we are adamant that workers should not be asked to pay for governments failure to invest in electricity
1654833 it has to be seen in the context of all the other increases in prices which clearly make the electricity tariff that much more difficult to bear particularly the food price increases the fuel price going up and the rise in interest rates
1654834 he musharraf might make such a commando attack on parliament

1654840 the government and the energy companies have decided that replacing kingsnorth will be a symbol that britain is able to use a form of energy generation that produces massive amounts of harmful co2
1654841 but we determined that our protest will also be a symbol
1654842 if we can stop this power station being built then we will make it much harder for the authorities to defy public pressure and build other coal fired stations in the future
1654843 when the time is right they will move together streaming into the power station to shut it down
1654844 if the law protects the right of industries to destroy the planet then it is up to people like us to prevent that even if it means breaking the law
1654845 while we completely respect the protesters right to campaign peacefully what is not acceptable are their plans to invade the power station
1654846 power stations are not adventure playgrounds and if anyone does get in they will be putting their safety and the safety of our workers at risk
1654847 what we have found is a bunch of intelligent and articulate people who have set a real example to us
1654848 all that means is that more coal will be burned and the pollution will remain
1654849 no one actually knows how much coal we will need to burn when the new power station is built that depends on market conditions
1654850 we are about pushing for radical social change about the whole way the economy works
1654851 what we know at this time no additional information is available further updates are expected

1654859 new ec followers have not realised where their new uncertain biblical interpretation method will lead them for now most of them remain mostly biblical but in a decade or two they will have strayed further it has been said that future generations of ec followers will probably slide all the way to apostasy and rejection of christian ethics as many modernists have done
1654860 thats not a church and youre not a pastor and youre not even a christian they dont believe in any doctrine in any theology

1654870 reform need not be bothered with the intricacies of a well defined
1654871 conserving for the sake of conservation just doesnt fly as well the future is necessarily open ended but anyone invested in preserving valuable aspects of a supposedly cherished past needs to be able to coherently pinpoint what is worth preserving or even
1654872 values are nothing but blurred second hand collective hallucinations of a generation disastrously failing to grasp modern day ideological challenges
1654873 arent self aware of their own mysticism and violently resist being called out on it reality escape routes unmarked by 6000 year old earths and noahs arks are necessarily and conveniently more elusive
1654874 principles are too ideologically explosive for any republican executive to handle consistently e g the failed
1654875 our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
1654876 many of the founding fathers and revolutionary war leaders were deists and upheld a firm separation of church and state
1654877 it is impossible to rightly govern a nation without god and the bible
1654878 i can only say that there is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than i do to see a plan adopted for the abolition of slavery
1654879 the christian religion is above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times the religion of wisdom virtue equity and humanity let the blackguard paine say what he will
1654880 the inane treatment of judeo christianity as a proxy for western civilization should be first to go tying the moral foundations of the american nation with cultural archetypes of prehistoric biblical jews or with those of devout europeans emulating them is beyond preposterous

1655091 our discussions in those early days were very much about how it could play a role in reducing the environmental impact of the games by things such as high bandwidth networks reducing the need for travel smart logistics systems to handle the movement of materials and equipment into and out of beijing and for smart building management systems to be embedded into the designs of all the new facilities being constructed
1655092 there was not a lot of conversation at that time on reducing the impact of it systems themselves through things like thin client computing since those were very nascent concepts in 2001 02 in relation to the reduction of energy consumption
1655093 with an event like the olympics you cant allow for stuttering especially during crucial moments like a goal its a black eye on the branding of the broadcaster too
1655094 it is easier to pre populate a network with one item
1655095 first generation networks placed tens of thousands of servers with one item to serve it up but a million separate files wanting to be seen by a million different users is a bigger challenge
1655096 nbc significantly increased the specifications for systems availability this time around given the extensive plans for video streaming

1655102 if the young players work hard at their game listen to the advice of the coaching staff they realise they will have every opportunity here
1655103 the manager has always said he will play them if they are good enough and he is true to his word he always has been in every way but the bar is extremely high and you have to be over it to get the opportunity
1655104 jack was given the opportunity by the manager to go on the austrian training camp along with five others who have all done really well
1655105 jack has taken his chance and he is one of quite a few we have here that we have high hopes for
1655106 you have to adapt to the physical aspects of the game and i think jack is strong enough
1655107 it is about how you physically develop and i think with jack even at 16 it doesnt mean he wont be as physically strong as someone at 18 or even someone at 20
1655108 that has been the benefit of our reserve team the experienced players that our lads are up against means they learn on the pitch

1655168 we are working to provide them with the additional forces they would like there is a concerted effort by this building to figure out what more can be done and as the secretary said he would like it done sooner rather than later
1655169 at some point soon hes going to make a recommendation to the secretary and to the president on the possibility of further troop drawdowns
1655170 i know much has been made of sort of the correlation between forces coming down in iraq and going up in afghanistan
1655171 and while that certainly would seem to be the most natural transaction to take place the truth is were nearly 2 5 million strong around the world we have the means to draw forces elsewhere whether it be through reserves or national guard or drawing down from other places around the world where we have commitments
1655172 we have first commitments across the globe and threats and contingencies we need to be situated for beyond just the wars in iraq and afghanistan

1655176 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
1655177 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
1655178 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
1655179 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
1655180 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts
1655181 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
1655182 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest

1655185 the pto s new interpretation of patentable subject matter provides a clear avenue to reject patent applications and to invalid issued patents on all patents on innovative computer implemented processes without regard to how meritorious or creative the innovation is
1655186 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
1655187 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way
1655188 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose

1655202 medellin was very calm he looked right at the family when he apologized for his actions he then looked at his witnesses and said i love you i love you the pena and ertman family were emotional but reserved
1655203 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1655204 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1655205 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1655206 state and federal courts on three separate occasions have already satisfied the world courts suggestion that american courts examine whether medellin suffered actual legal harm when authorities did not inform him about certain rights under the vienna convention
1655207 on all three occasions state and federal courts concluded that medellin suffered no legal harm

1655221 our verylife depends on this body being relatively healthy and together but our body will disintegrate and thats it it will leave us jus as a friend departs from a friend no matter how much we love people or they ove us we will go through that transition withour company ther is nothing our dear ones can do to help us clinging to them will only hinder our ability to let go and move on with ease
1655222 sar presentata a met o a fine settembre assieme al ddl bilancio
1655223 lintensificarsi della crisi ci ha ulteriormente convinto che bisognava anticipare la manovra non sarebbe stato ragionevole presentarsi in autunno con la finanziaria in discussione e i saldi pubblici aperti
1655224 questanno ha assicurato letta che ha voluto ribadire lapprezzamento per loperato di tremonti fugando le voci di dissapori circolate negli ultimi giorni per la prima volta stato compiuto un passo serio forte deciso per riformare il sistema e lo si deve a tremonti che ha saputo portare nel giro di pochissimi giorni e prima dellabituale sessione di settembre la riforma non ancora completa e che sar completata ma che rappresenta una grande novit forse una rivoluzione
1655225 ha assunto limpegno del pareggio di bilancio entro il 2011 e lo intendiamo rispettare

1655227 le societ di calcio non hanno alcun obbligo di concedere i giocatori alle nazionali olimpiche
1655228 non esiste una decisione specifica del comitato esecutivo della fifa che stabilisca lobbligo di mettere a disposizione i giocatori con meno di 23 anni per questa competizione
1655229 rispetto questa sentenza ha proseguito blatter ma rinnovo il mio appello ai tre club affinch permettano ai loro giocatori di partecipare ai giochi in armonia con lo spirito olimpico
1655230 di quel giorno ricordo poco ho lanciato il sottolavello ma non cera nessuno

1655233 del 2 febbraio dellanno scorso ho ricordi molto labili quello che successo non lo ricordavo completamente poi mi sono visto nel filmato e vero ho preso il sottolavello ma lho gettato in aria per togliermelo dalle mani e quando lho lanciato non cerano esponenti delle forze dellordine
1655234 sono cresciuto molto e in tutti questi mesi non ho mai avuto momenti di abbattimento e di sconforto il mio stato un percorso di inserimento e di rieducazione

1655241 el tribunal ha concluido que el shalke 04 el werder bremen y el fc barcelona no tienen obligaci n ligar de liberar a sus respectivos jugadores rafinha diego y messi para el torneo ol mpico de f tbol
1655242 el torneo ol mpico de f tbol no est incluido en el calendario coordinado de partidos y no existe una decisi n espec fica del comit ejecutivo de la fifa que establezca la obligaci n de los clubes de liberar a los jugadores menores de 23 a os para este campeonato
1655243 no afecta al estatus de los jugadores oficialmente convocados por su comit ol mpico nacional que siguen siendo seleccionables para competir en los juegos ol mpicos de pek n
1655244 a la vista de la recomendaci n de la fifa a los clubes de liberar a sus jugadores y en aras del esp ritu ol mpico el tas hace un llamamiento a la fifa y a los clubes para que adopten una soluci n razonable con buena voluntad y sentido com n en relaci n con aquellos jugadores que deseen representar a su pa s en los juegos ol mpicos
1655245 el calendario internacional de partidos no tiene importancia alguna en el momento en que se establece si los clubes tienen la obligaci n de liberar a sus jugadores para el torneo ol mpico de f tbol masculino
1655246 representan una oportunidad nica para los atletas de cualquier disciplina deportiva y que por tanto no podr a justificarse que se impidiera a cualquier jugador menor de 23 a os participar en ese acontecimiento en caso de que su equipo representativo se hubiese clasificado
1655247 lo normal es que ahora vaya a jugar con argentina pero si el tas falla a favor del club tendr a que volver
1655248 creemos que el anuncio es excepcional y transmite el mensaje de secret obsession
1655249 we got engaged in the brazilian rainforest and i wanted a wedding blessing that would top my proposal it was unbelievable looking down and seeing my family and friends below was just incredible im lost for words
1655250 as i got older i became more adventurous i bring the adventurous side out of darren he used to be scared of heights
1655251 i did this before about eight years ago its certainly the most unusual wedding ive ever done the only hairy moment was when i thought my goggles were about to come off
1655252 and instead of getting the movie hed gotten the bonus extras and granted it probably was shit m said
1655253 i am very happy to be here at blackburn it will be an amazing adventure for me
1655254 one of the key challenges has been to prepare the massive deployment of tens of thousand of equipment in more than 70 venues in a short time and making sure the proper version of software is deployed for each of them
1655255 we have strict implementation policies a reliable software distribution solution and extensively trained the core it teams at the venues
1655256 the date limit we have set to decide the future of samuel etoo is the 12th august
1655257 if there is a decision the best solution would be to do so before the champions league preliminary
1655258 we are looking at reactions and above all watching to see how pep guardiola sees himself with the group and with the player
1655259 i dont know if any premiership club want to buy etoo or if his club wantto retain him because the guy his a good player which any club will to buy from patrick ojo in lagos
1655260 if he wasnt such a big head i wouldnt mind him at arsenal
1655261 the situation over ownership has not changed since day one certainly not for the last five years i have been saying it at every annual general meeting since
1655262 we are looking for investment we always have been and we always will be and that continues
1655263 i do look at the clubs that have the champions league status that brings in millions and have the multi multi multi millionaires and the billionaires in them and i think that is probably what it takes now to get a hugely successful football club
1655264 there is a part of me that hopes that is not true of course there is and there always will be that feeling inside me
1655265 but if you look at that top four and the consistency of the top four there is a lot of money floating around them and we at everton do not have that money
1655266 a ground move is certainly crucial to the economic future of everton i have said it a million times that i love goodison park but we have to move for economic and financial reasons
1655267 we have to get more income into the club to begin to compete with those clubs i have been talking about
1655268 that is the reason we have been contemplating it and the truth is we have had enormous support from knowsley council from tesco and we have not had that from liverpool council that is the bottom line of it
1655269 all that talk last week about david moyes betting suspended on him going and quitting im amazed
1655270 i am on the phone to him all the time and you wonder where all this comes from
1655271 it all seemed to come from the fact that we lost a game in america last week thats all of course no one is a good loser at everton we never want to lose
1655272 the real problem this close season is that apart from steven pienaar we actually have not signed any new players
1655273 i just want to pull off one deal just one of the transfers we have been chasing for the last six weeks that would be a start and then the next one and next one
1655274 before you get any investment speak to jell and rob walton they know whats best for the club i disagree i do think everton can make the top 4 next year tho in the championship
1655275 moyes is a good manager really the type of manager that can always ensure top 17 finish every year similar to benitez who always seems to finish 4th
1655276 fc barcelona will receive half a million euros plus an extra 900 000 euros depending on the number of appearances made by the player classification for the champions league and any titles won
1655277 furthermore fc barcelona will receive 25 per cent of any possible future transfer as well as retaining the option to buy the player back at the end of the 2009 10 season for 2million euros

1655290 this is a deliberate action to inconvenience the voters we condemn the election commission for their decision
1655291 we fear there could be rigging we urge our supporters not to be complacent it is going to be a tough battle but we are confident of victory
1655292 this is a man under siege and he sees no way out but to deflect the attention of the malaysian people with a sham trial against me

1655317 we look forward to the discussions with the people of hawaii and chile regarding the opportunities to open a new era in astronomy in one of these two world capitals of astronomy
1655318 canadian scientists have partnered in the extensive site testing carried out by tmt and we are very pleased to see that it has led to two great options for tmt

1655441 signal bars are the combination of two factors the raw signal strength received from the cell tower and the signal to noise ratio the snr essentially how well the tower can hear your phone based on how much other noise data you are competing with
1655442 when you see full bars what youre seeing is that your phone is hearing the the local signal loud and clear but what is not shown is if the tower can hear your phone shout back throughout your call the amount of data being sent to your tower can change frequently and when a deluge hits its as though youre pissing into a waterfall in this case youre not actually being lied to just selectively informed

1655454 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1655493 not exactly i feel quite comfortable writing for orchestras and im just going in there all balls flying
1655494 i dont rewrite much if i get too picky and finicky about what im doing i write crap music
1655495 i draw big graphic shapes to conjure the kind of piece im aiming at with a timeline of what happens where and arrows and signs for the loud bits then i pace around making cuts and stabs on the score and stomp and whack the piano and yell its all quite tribal
1655496 i love using live electronics often grimy and industrial and glitchy sounding ill stumble across a rhythm and obsess and burrow into it
1655497 i had a good ear and played in youth orchestras but i wasnt brilliant and i knew i couldnt make a career out of it
1655498 the teacher at my local comp seemed to think i was quite good but it was all still quite tentative
1655499 the camberwell style is eclectic from jazz and electronic to well haphazard we all have different tastes but its all very ballsy and faff free
1655500 its never been an issue or a problem my music isnt very girly or delicate its nasty and raucous and gutsy
1655501 as long as the music is honest thats all i care about if that doesnt sound like a self righteous preacher
1655502 all the time i listen when i dance or cook i hoover to stravinsky its noisy enough and you can hear the rhythms and the energy above the racket
1655503 gotta catch em all structure agency and pedagogy in childrens media culture

1655506 currently the bill has been referred to the senate judiciary committee where fellow senators will carefully consider this important legislation
1655507 the information wasnt complete to senator eddie calvo unfortunately it wasnt because senator calvo now has an impression that we have a surplus or an excess 25 million chairman wants central office personnel disseminated in schools
1655508 activities such as poetry story telling oral arts or like chanting things of this nature that involve the language
1655509 the growth in sales of 13 2 the increase in gas amp services recurring operating margin and the strong growth in diluted earnings per share of 10 6 in the first half of 2008 illustrate the strength of air liquides business model for long term sustained growth
1655510 given the economic and financial situation in 2008 the momentum generated by the alma programme is a significant asset for air liquide thanks to better execution and greater focus of our actions alma should allow us to continue this accelerated growth and improved competitiveness
1655511 in this context we remain confident in the ability of air liquide to achieve double digit growth in 2008 net profit at constant exchanges rates
1655512 i think a lot of people expect a certain element of sex to our music and theres a tinge of sex throughout the record but this is the most blatant
1655513 i thought it was ridiculous but the guys thought it was a hook
1655514 i was like come on man i gotta be singing about someones fiery sex for a year and half
1655515 the success of our large scale projects in china demonstrates our capabilities to help customers win with technology efficiency and low cost by leveraging our global expertise and local resources we are in a very good position to execute these projects and meet our customers increasing requirements

1655517 we are honoured to play a role in supporting the development of the petrochemical industry in china our facility will be one of the first in that region to produce liquid products
1655518 it puts us in a very competitive position to meet the growing product demand that is driven by strong economic and industrial development in the region in a very cost effective and efficient way

1655522 i was a little bit surprised when the name of kevin pietersen came up to captain england
1655523 it is from the point of view that he has not really been playing for england for long and secondly he has no experience which is crucial
1655524 but the most important reason which really concerns me is what effect the captaincy will have on his batting because they definitely need him very badly to perform as a batter
1655525 it could be very difficult if he is affected by the captaincy in a very big way
1655526 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealizable by ordinary mortals
1655527 sex love and fashion a memoir of a male model
1655528 bruce hulse never learned that gentlemen dont kiss and tell
1655529 what happens with animals when their skin is ripped from their bodies when they are still alive its heartbreaking for me
1655530 i think they just didnt understand what we had planned
1655531 we are not protesting against china we just want to promote compassion for animals
1655532 thousands of people are sharing the names of the fuwa
1655533 crude oil has fallen 13 percent since trading at a record 147 a barrel on july 11 lehman said july 15 crude will average 93 a barrel next year from a 114 so far this year dresdner said july 31 there will be a rapid price retrenchment
1655534 its not a terrible thing you want to see that
1655535 it seems like miami dade is picking up declining property value speed or falling off a cliff
1655536 whats happening in the market today will not be reflected until next year which is going to be worse from everything weve seen
1655537 if this amendment 5 were to pass in november which i hope it does people will look at that as a lot more than a tweak
1655538 a 25 percent reduction in property taxes not just for homesteads but for second homes for small businesses owners thats more than tweak i would think
1655539 we could be getting sicker were looking for the doctor
1655540 we are getting an increased volume of calls from people of all ages who are short financially
1655541 but we are seeing a very definite increase among seniors
1655542 they are asking for assistance with things like utility bills food closet referrals free transportation and housing they are having some type of emergency in their lives and the issue usually is money
1655543 people are complaining to me that theyre just not making it
1655544 this economy is hard on everyone but it is really hard on seniors right now
1655545 their incomes are fixed when things keep going up and up what do you do
1655546 i like the idea of free beans and rice at a food bank because it seems like every time you go to the grocery store things are up 10 cents or 15 cents
1655547 i dont waste trips sometimes ill park the car and take a bus
1655548 you just have to change your philosophy of living you have to change your habits
1655549 these are people whose incomes are very limited and are not rising with the cost of food fuel and medicine
1655550 what we often hear from clients these days is that they are having to pick and choose what they can pay for
1655551 i always was drawn to the area of public health and nutrition
1655552 my kids were going off to college and i was ready for something different
1655553 i learned about the extension service and thought that was something i would enjoy doing
1655554 i deal with anything that has to do with family in particular anything that helps families make consumer choices
1655555 food safety and food preservation thats where extension has its niche
1655556 some days you come in and do planning for programs or you might come in and some major thing has happened and youve got calls coming in like when the powers out and people are calling to see if its still safe to keep their food
1655557 she understands how easy it is to slip away from an exercise routine
1655558 we do things like set up fruits and vegetable stations and let kids try fruits and vegetables they may have never had
1655559 we had three classes on food safety in one we did the glow germ activity we put orange lotion on their hands then had them wash their hands then we used a black light to show them what areas they missed washing
1655560 janelle saw the need to teach nutrition in the schools and she got the grant for that
1655561 she just has an impeccable work ethic she really dots every i and crosses every t
1655562 janelle is very quiet and unassuming but she has lots of innovative ideas
1655563 she really has the people of stokes at heart because shes one of them
1655564 shes very reserved but when it comes to her programs that passion really comes out
1655565 i like helping people learn new skills theres never a dull moment
1655566 i wanted you to eat me whole i wanted to swim inside of you carry me along against your ribs lick the ventricles caress your spine i wanted to curl inside your instep or find your adams apple on my tongue i wanted you to eat me until i could not swallow without your saliva mouth

1655583 dangerous careless and reckless with the car going off the road at points
1655584 i thought i was going to die that this is my last minute
1655585 if we continue on this trend its going to be a big problem
1655586 it takes a lot more than just doing the test
1655587 die t ter m ssen verfolgt geschnappt und wie andere m rder auch vor gericht gestellt werden andernfalls droht vielen anderen schwulen in istanbul und der t rkei berhaupt das gleiche schicksal
1655588 we are quite simply witnessing one of the greatest examples of misplaced priorities in the history of the u s presidency
1655589 im all for energy independence but im going to get there by opening up lands like the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil extraction
1655590 you know what we really need is something that merges neocons and environmentalists because they both actually have the same interests right now
1655591 this is something that is going to drive our reform agenda pay down our deficit strengthen our international standing leave a greener earth for your kids and make us energy independent
1655592 hey were doing this youve got to do this now too
1655593 david is a young player but we knew when we signed him that he had a lot of ability and a lot of potential
1655594 it can sometimes be difficult for young players when they move to a new club but he has done well and it will be good for his confidence that he has already scored two goals
1655595 it is now important that he keeps on working hard and trying to get better because he still needs to improve i think that he will do that
1655596 his goals are positive but equally important is his movement because this shows that he has game intelligence which was one of the main reasons why we brought him to liverpool
1655597 the abc loan has been of great concern to qpr fans and has been a noose around the neck of this football club for far too long
1655598 i am delighted that we have now made arrangements to put this saga to an end
1655599 the manager makes the decisions and hes never ever steered us wrong before we go along with whatever he says if we dont sign any players then well go into the season as confident as ever if we do then great
1655600 siamo pi vicini di prima ha affermato il vicepresidente del club
1655601 siamo dove siamo ci siamo dati un tempo per riflettere non siamo n vicini n lontani n in mezzo tutto ancora aperto e vedremo che succede la prossima settimana
1655602 sure i would like the road to nome but if i cant afford to live here that road is going to do me no good
1655603 weve reverted back to saying heres 1 200 you decide best how to deal with your heating and fuel costs its easier to let the people decide themselves rather than us
1655604 twelve hundred dollars in one part of alaska does not meet the same needs that 1 200 in another part of alaska does
1655605 im concerned we are watching our nations ice breaking capabilities decline
1655606 we are in a five nation race for the arctic and right now we are running fifth
1655607 when the government decides to investigate you its my job to work with them as ive done with my lawyers
1655608 when this is all said and done i believe youll see that the investigation is not warranted in fact i will be exonerated
1655609 the investigation in our eyes is not complete but we could not find evidence of slaughter or waste
1655610 we have been in denial from the beginning and now its panning out that way we feel that there was nothing that was done wrong
1655611 this is huge this is something that we have troopers saying they have never seen a case of this magnitude when it comes to wanton waste
1655612 the count that were looking at isnt the whole 120 were looking at the ones that involve the wanton waste which would have been the 60 that were either not salvaged at all or only partially salvaged
1655613 we are not trying to hide anything we are doing our investigation and there is no reason that we would inflate the numbers
1655614 we as inupiat people have always lived off the land the sea our way of life has always been so close to nature
1655615 they still hunt with the skin boats and everything like that and this really hurt the village quite a bit to know the residents did something like this
1655616 the response from people out in the world is just so negative and so violent towards us now when the facts were not even true
1655617 we want to let our community know that we will deal with it and punish them to the full extent of the law whatever it takes to ensure this never happens again
1655618 our perception is no we are not getting any cooperation from villagers
1655619 were beginning to see that it was all blown out of proportion
1655620 we feel confident that there wasnt any wrongdoing that was done but if there was then well act on it
1655621 its a hop skip and a jump to the north end of the coastal trail
1655622 having an historic building in the community helps maintain a sense of place in the community and is important for future generations
1655623 who doesnt dream of working in a timber framed office with excellent daylight a convenient downtown location and great neighbors
1655624 and what better way to show commitment to sustainability than by giving new life to a well crafted structure we just had to move in and were the first to commit to space
1655625 our cause is to be a catalyst of the community and were excited to be part of the revitalization of not only an historic building but the entire ship creek area
1655626 its an opportunity to spark the community preserve a historic building reduce energy costs and call a cool place home
1655627 is one of the two most difficult sentences since my time here as a judge
1655628 youll never be a mother youll never know unconditional love
1655629 how can you live in your skin youre a cold piece of work it didnt have to go down like that
1655630 its a giant project for anchorage in terms of the amount of people it will take and the amount of equipment it will take
1655631 this one is big in the complexity of it because it needs to be built in the busiest part of anchorage
1655632 if youre one of the tens of thousands living north of anchorage and wanting to go to the kenai peninsula or girdwood or whittier youre basically routed through town
1655633 itd be wonderful to drive across anchorage and not hit a stoplight
1655634 is there is going to be a lot of impact wherever it goes
1655635 youll see some of us including myself out there chaining ourselves to bulldozers
1655636 connecting the two highways would remove 200 000 trips per day from tudor 15th gambell and muldoon
1655637 youve got kids on the west side who cant take advantage of the rec center because they have to cross those streets and you have people on the east who have to walk across those streets to get their groceries
1655638 five dollar four dollar gas thats a scenario we have to consider we have to provide the public with better mass transit
1655639 a light rail needs to be an integral part of this
1655640 and the glenn and muldoon interchange needs to be fixed now when that mall opens its going to be a nightmare
1655641 the state should step in with some of its billions of dollars in oil money and get muldoon redesigned and rebuilt now
1655642 what else can we do in anchorage with three quarters of a billion dollars the list is long
1655643 this is a solution for 2 20 a gallon gas not 4 50 a gallon gas we dont have good balance here youve got to have trails that connect buses that work
1655644 we dont see this as the broader transportation solution for that stretch of road itd be pretty cool but is it the best thing for anchorage it doesnt come close
1655645 were tired of being the nations symbol of excess and greed
1655646 its not a particular earmark in alaska im concerned about right now its the abuse of the process
1655647 how can you truthfully claim that youre not taking special interest money when this group is financing almost half of the campaign against me
1655648 one of the most extreme groups in washington d c
1655649 i wouldnt say that giving 500 million to a canadian company is getting government out of private enterprise
1655650 im tenacious im methodical im focused and i will not give up
1655651 frankly i just want to be a light and make a change make a difference in congress
1655652 im running because im the best person for the job ive got the experience the knowledge the connections that are necessary to get this job done
1655653 i stood up to them on the house floor as you recall i was the one who said this is our floor no lobbyist is supposed to tell us what to do
1655654 wouldnt it be more meaningful to stand up when its the right thing to do instead of when its the most politically expedient thing to do
1655655 i learned a lot but i certainly didnt influence the outcome of that race
1655656 you should have some regrets about helping to elect frank murkowski
1655657 i support an immediate planning for withdrawal it is in our best interest and the iraqi peoples best interest to withdraw

1655662 whats remarkable this summer is the stability of this race
1655663 in a broad sense it is similar to previous elections
1655664 i am what you have been waiting for and arrogant beyond all belief
1655665 if you are either obama or mccain you want to get over the 50 percent line with women
1655666 although women credited hillary with clearing the path for future aspirants theyre much less certain it will be her or when that will be
1655667 many of these women intuit that whoever wins this election will be a one termer but it may also be a function of the feeling that hope springs eternal

1655671 as a great admirer of the royal family i was disgusted to see that two of the animals in
1655672 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
1655673 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
1655674 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
1655675 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
1655676 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
1655677 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
1655678 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
1655679 dagens tal markerer at vi efterh nden har sagt endeligt farvel til rene med et us dvanligt lavt niveau for antallet af tvangsauktioner
1655680 vores vurdering er at vi fremadrettet vil se en fortsat stigende tendens i antallet af tvangsauktioner i takt med at boligpriserne fortsat falder og der n ppe er udsigt til at den europ iske centralbank kommer boligejerne til hj lp med lavere rentei r
1655681 dagens tal viser klart at boligkrisen nu begynder at kradse i de danske hjem
1655682 med den fortsatte stigning i boligudbuddet h jere l nerenter samt udsigt til generelt svagere konjunkturer er der meget som tyder p at antallet af tvangsauktioner vil forts tte med at stige i de kommende m neder
1655683 selv om antallet af tvangsauktioner steg kraftigt i juli s er der heldigvis fortsat meget f boliger som ender p tvangsauktion niveauet for antallet af tvangsauktioner er fortsat meget lavt set i et historisk perspektiv

1655692 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
1655693 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
1655694 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
1655695 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
1655696 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
1655697 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
1655698 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
1655699 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
1655700 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
1655701 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
1655702 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
1655703 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
1655704 the reign of charlemagne was greatly aided by a general improvement in the weather during the eight and ninth centuries
1655705 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
1655706 eksportandelen i tekstilbranchen er p 66 pct og i bekl dningsbranchen p 90 pct det betyder f rst og fremmest at bekl dningsindustrien ikke er s konjunkturf lsom i forhold til udviklingen p det danske marked internationalt har branchen historisk ogs altid form et at bev ge sig mod str mmen og s ge nye markeder
1655707 i guess you didnt hear about all those darn ethics investigation a fresh one just last month over the portrait scandal that huck hes a real doosie aint he
1655708 all of this party division started with huck and his followers are still at it
1655709 hucks whole strategy was to exploit anti mormon sentiment by playing the religion card against romney it worked in iowa
1655710 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1655711 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1655712 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs
1655713 we were not as clear as we might have been
1655714 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
1655715 certainly there are many people who would sign a petition which would allow someone access to a ballot which is part of our democratic process
1655716 without him on the ballot al gore would have been president
1655717 its time for the next generation exemplified in every way by democratic presidential candidate barack obama
1655718 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1655719 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw

1655722 about the only time its not so friendly is when the hateriots patriots come to town
1655723 we went to a playoff game in baltimore and we were definitely verbally abused there
1655724 i think its sad that they have to make a rule like that for fans you would expect people to have more mature behavior
1655725 i think a lot of people that go to games would like to say that its a nice family atmosphere but we all know that kind of stuff goes on anyway
1655726 yell scream when i played i didnt care if people booed you paid your ticket that was your right to do it

1655729 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
1655730 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1655731 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1655732 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1655733 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1655734 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1655735 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1655736 the stakes could not be higher everything hinges on stopping coal
1655737 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1655738 were going to stay in iraq to get the job done as long as the government wants us there
1655739 said his government was impatiently waiting for the complete withdrawal of u
1655740 redeploy combat brigades from iraq at a pace of 1 to 2 brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months
1655741 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
1655742 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
1655743 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
1655744 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h
1655745 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like
1655746 the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia since 1991
1655747 wilful killing wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body and health employment of poisonous weapons and other weapons to cause unnecessary suffering wanton destruction of cities towns and villages unlawful attacks on civilian objects devastation not necessitated by military objectives attacks on undefended buildings and dwellings destruction and wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion charity and education the arts and sciences
1655748 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
1655749 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
1655750 a obama le va muy bien con los hispanos mi expectativa es que gane por el margen de 2 a 1
1655751 es una poblaci n m s joven con menos educaci n con menos ciudadanos pero si vemos el crecimiento de los medios de comunicaci n hispanos en canales televisivos radio y diarios comprobamos su creciente poder
1655752 europe can fuck off if they think we are going to keep on paying silly money for all these johnny foreigners who come over here and steal our jobs scottish football should be about scottish footballers and nothing else
1655753 when scotland becomes its own continent we will have our own independent champions league and our own version of the european championships the highland games that means scottish teams will always win i fancy those odds this is what mel gibson was fighting for all those years ago death to all foreign bastards and free smack for all our children
1655754 i use dragon naturallyspeaking to regain control of the life that was temporarily robbed from me and to bring that same sense of empowerment to other soldiers just like me
1655755 the use of dragon naturallyspeaking to use a computer to connect to do something that i was able to do before i was injured made me feel somewhat whole somewhat normal for the first time it has been my distinct pleasure and honor to give that feeling a feeling of ability to our wounded dragon has not only improved my life it has changed my life
1655756 det er besk mmende at det efterh nden er s dan i danmark at m nd som det mest naturlige i verden bare f r mere i l n end kvinder og det viser at regeringens ligel nsstatistik overhovedet ikke virker

1655758 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
1655759 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
1655760 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
1655761 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
1655762 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
1655763 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
1655764 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
1655765 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
1655766 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
1655767 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
1655768 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
1655769 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
1655770 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
1655771 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
1655772 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that

1655775 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1655776 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1655777 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1655778 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
1655779 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1655780 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
1655781 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
1655782 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
1655783 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
1655784 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1655785 simplexity why simple things become complex and how complex things can be made simple
1655786 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1655787 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1655788 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1655789 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1655790 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1655791 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1655792 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1655793 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1655794 a una persecuci n que va m s all de lo que dictan las leyes
1655795 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1655796 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1655797 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1655798 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1655799 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1655800 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1655801 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1655802 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1655803 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1655804 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1655805 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1655806 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1655807 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1655808 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1655809 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1655810 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved

1655813 il salto nel futuro sar molto buffo allinizio del primo episodio ma alla fine della premiere i telespettatori ci prenderanno gusto non sar un salto stridente come la gente potrebbe pensare
1655814 il personaggio che ha attraversato i cambiamenti personali maggiori passando da una donna che voleva una relazione da favola ad una donna che ha abbandonato una relazione da favola per finire in una relazione con un uomo che esige molto da una relazione pi di quanto susan voglia e possa dare questo cambiamento lo vedrete nei flashback
1655815 gaby continuer a fare i conti con la cecit di carlos e s probabilmente quella che ha avuto il cambiamento pi grande e aggiunger del mistero hanno detto i produttori quando il mistero collegato ai nostri personaggi le cose diventano migliori e anche per edie le cose saranno cambiate enormemente
1655816 i think the business had been flatlining it had very modest growth or declining growth across the previous four to five years
1655817 the reality was that the pace of change outside of mcdonalds had been quicker than the pace of change within the business and we were getting left behind
1655818 they are ticking all the right boxes in terms of sourcing such as locally sourced irish and british beef and fair trade
1655819 they have at least bothered with free range eggs and organic milk
1655820 we have reduced the salt on fries and ketchup we want to maintain the taste but improve the nutritional profile
1655821 we will not keep all of our customers happy all the time the changes we have made are widely recognised and customers are responding to them
1655822 we are still looking to improve the salad we offer we are still committed to making them relevant and tasty for the customers who want them
1655823 the reality is that the sustained campaign in the media the government and health bodies message to eat more healthily has affected those brands
1655824 our uk business has not been as buoyant as it is now for four years
1655825 we are not recession resistant but we are recession resilient
1655826 people are searching out value for money and they are more demanding of what they want from their money
1655827 i am not aware of them dramatically changing their marketing in the way they target children who have always been attracted to them
1655828 we need some regulation of fast food outlets and their opening close to residential areas anyone can open a fast food outlet anywhere without planning restriction as long as they meet food hygiene regulations
1655829 uk pension schemes of ftse 100 companies enjoyed a brief period of surplus until early in 2008
1655830 some companies chose to spend their surpluses on various forms of de risking activity including buy out purchasing financial swaps and reducing their exposure to equities
1655831 events of the last year demonstrate the importance of assessing and managing pension risks and being prepared to take opportunities when they present themselves
1655832 it is inevitable that employers will keep on closing schemes to both new and existing members especially in the face of so much uncertainty around funding and costs
1655833 this is the final chapter final salary pensions promise will soon be a thing of the past for private sector workers
1655834 youve reached charley daniels on the dot com news desk im on vacation until august fifth so please dont leave a message because what would be the point
1655835 youve reached the voicemail of shit paused too long and now it sounds like i dont know my own name

1655849 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1655850 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1655851 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1655852 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1655853 get the junk out of the trunk and properly inflate your tires an extra 100 pounds in your vehicle could reduce your fuel efficiency by up to 2
1655854 we hope we are going to get more next week
1655855 he expressed himself but its just his sensation at the start of the season
1655856 a season is long we will see how this is going to end up in august and take a decision
1655857 his crossing amp set pieces are as good as david bentleys
1655858 dave winfield played 22 seasons earning 12 all star game selections winfield batted 283 hit 465 home runs and amassed 3 110 hits he was a seven time gold glove winner winfield retired with 3 110 hits 465 home runs and a 283 batting average ranking in the top 20 all time in hits rbi games at bats doubles and total bases dave winfield is one of seven players in baseball history to reach both 3 000 hits and 400 home runs
1655859 outbreaks have included rats in maternity wards wasps and fleas in neo natal units bed bug infestations flies in operating theatres and maggots found in patients slippers
1655860 the conservatives asked all 171 hospital trusts in england for details of pest control incidents for the last two years of those 127 trusts responded and almost all had experienced problems and 100 of them collected detailed information about pest infestations in total there were almost 20 000 reports of pest problems and seven out of 10 trusts that responded reported they had called in pest control officers more than 50 times since january 2006 an average of once a fortnight
1655861 of the trusts that collected detailed information 80 per cent had problems with ants 66 per cent had rats 77 per cent had mice 59 per cent had problems with cockroaches 65 per cent had biting insects or fleas 24 per cent had problems with bed bugs and 6 per cent had maggots
1655862 labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infestations is concerning
1655863 we need greater transparency in nhs infection control and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards
1655864 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1655865 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1655866 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1655867 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1655868 huh ok ill watch the first 5 minutes and as soon as morgan spurlock inserts his shitty animation montages or goofy schtick jokes ill stop
1655869 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1655870 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1655871 the mastermind behind the beijing olympics ticketing scam is believed to be a briton with a long history of operating fraudulent ticketing schemes and it is not the first time australians have been caught in his web
1655872 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1655873 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1655874 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1655875 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1655876 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1655877 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1655878 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1655879 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1655880 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1655881 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1655882 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1655883 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1655884 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
1655885 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
1655886 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
1655887 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
1655888 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
1655889 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
1655890 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
1655891 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
1655892 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
1655893 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
1655894 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
1655895 i was a little bit surprised when the name of kevin pietersen came up to captain england
1655896 it is from the point of view that he has not really been playing for england for long and secondly he has no experience which is crucial
1655897 but the most important reason which really concerns me is what effect the captaincy will have on his batting because they definitely need him very badly to perform as a batter
1655898 it could be very difficult if he is affected by the captaincy in a very big way
1655899 i would have said for the moment put him in the one day game
1655900 it was all rather chaotic there was a long line at the two entrances for a while both lines were moving but ours suddenly stopped and we were told we couldnt get in
1655901 so we moved to the other line they let a few more people through that one but then the girl at the door said she couldnt allow any one else in because it would be a fire hazard
1655902 there were about 10 or 15 of us all with tickets and young children who couldnt get in
1655903 every one left outside were really angry about the total lack of organisation
1655904 we were offered our money back or alternative dates for the show however the majority of us had already travelled to the venue with very small children struggled down the very steep and un parent child friendly steps waited for over 30 minutes to be told at the last minute that there was no more room in the theatre try explaining that to a two year old
1655905 the lady in front of me had taken time off work especially to go to the show for her daughters 2nd birthday there were many angry parents and hysterical children
1655906 every once in a while if i see a beautiful double bass lying backstage at a festival like charlie hadens bass ill pick it up and hit the e string just to feel it vibrate against my body its one of the great feelings in life
1655907 a very beautiful gravestone the material is probably marble from portugal the scroll and the letters are cut from the solid stone and not cut separately and applied later as well as the area below the letters the names of other family mambers will be cut there later the scroll was sanded with fine sandpaper which makes the stone smoother and darker for better contrast the gravestone is surrounded by beautiful square stones of course the planting is allowed to grow out of the joints a very suitable and clear gravestone for the sympathic dane
1655908 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1655909 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1655910 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1655911 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1655912 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1655913 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
1655914 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
1655915 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1655916 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1655917 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
1655918 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
1655919 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
1655920 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
1655921 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
1655922 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
1655923 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
1655924 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
1655925 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
1655926 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

1655941 lying between the law and freedom however has always been this third domain it is the domain of character the practice of private virtue such as honesty decency the telling of truth and all the other kinds of moral obligation it is the domain of public virtue such a civic duty responsibility philanthropy the articulation of all great ideas and good policies all of those things which might be encompassed in pauls statement that the gentiles who do not have the law do by nature what the law requires rom 2 14 this third domain is what must regulate life in the absence of legal coercion and governmental regulation it is where law and restraint are self imposed the demands come from within not from without in this area we find what john silber the former president of boston university has called obedience to the unenforceable this was the language of an english jurist in the 20th century john fletcher moulton who went on to say that the real greatness of a nation its true civilisation is measured by the extent to which the nation trusts its citizens and its area testifies to the way they behave in response to this trust today this middle territory is shrinking daily just when our understanding of ourselves as moral beings collapses and it is being co opted by the two domains that lie on each side of it law must now do what church family character belief and even cultural expectations once did by way of instructing and restraining human nature what is going to happen then if we keep stoking the fires with greater and greater amoral individualism and have to keep on dousing those fires with greater and greater recourse to litigation and regulation

1655974 our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular define disease in diabetes
1655975 in future it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables has health benefits for diabetic patients
1655976 it is encouraging to see that professor thornalley and his team have identified a potentially important substance that may protect and repair blood vessels from the damaging effects of diabetes it also may help add some scientific weight to the argument that eating broccoli is good for you
1655977 we try really hard to offer the very best of new england and this is the focus it is what i care most about
1655978 it took some time to convince the owner about the new focus but now hes definitely on board with it and it shows in our food
1655979 im really happy im here i have the best of all worlds i dont have the worries of being the owner but i can pretty much do what i want in the kitchen and design the menu
1655980 at age 14 i was working part time as a dishwasher in a restaurant in kennebunkport
1655981 i came in to work one day and the entire kitchen staff had walked out the owner was not popular he came into the kitchen and asked me if i could do lunch i said yes
1655982 i just took to cooking i love it and its what i know i do best
1655983 i only have to cook for my wife and two sons
1655984 after here its like taking a nap while i cook i love to braise meats and grill its easy and really what i enjoy the most

1655986 these last five years have been incredible and ive been able thanks to the owners support to expand and diversify the menu
1655987 i want to cook and serve under used species such as skate and bluefish monkfish
1655988 these fishes are very popular all over the world at the best restaurants but new englanders are shy to try them once they do they love it last week i made some hake as a special and the owner who had never tried hake just loved it this is the fun part of being a chef
1655989 most chefs do dream of owning their own restaurant and i may one day
1655990 but right now right here i have the best of all possible worlds with an owner who really lets me control the kitchen and menu it cant be much better than this and i dont have the hassles of ownership
1655991 i tell home cooks to learn how to salt salt when marinating salt the water and learn not to be afraid of salt throw out that table salt stuff and get to know the good salts
1655992 its the best thing you can learn how to do
1655993 stock making takes no effort at all you can leave a pot on the stove all day and make some great stock and freeze it it could not be easier
1655994 in all its guises braised and whatever its addictive and so marvelously textured my dish of pork three ways is a very popular seller you really cant beat it
1655995 is that i finally have a menu that i love and patrons love its all about new england and as close to local and sustainable as humanly possible its worth it and so what if we dont have everything all year seasonal food is really the best and this is what i cook and offer here at the dolphin striker

1656026 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1656027 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

1656036 it will entrench the sandton city complex as gautengs premier shopping destination and enable it to support the significant development and growth in this area particularly from new residences and the construction of the sandton gautrain station
1656037 this is a strategic milestone for the caverton offshore support group our current successes will be buttressed by the reliability and proven performance of the bell product in this part of the world as the demand for cavertons offerings continues to increase we are confident that our relationship with our technical partners and equipment manufacturers will continue to produce exceptional results for our business
1656038 i think vice chancellors are key all we the government can do is set in place a regulatory framework and allow space for independence
1656039 if oil prices and the rand hold at these levels during august the airlines will achieve a significant jet fuel cost saving in september and october possibly close to aprils prices
1656040 we will keep an eye on it and if the rand remains firm and the oil price weaker we will be able to pass those savings onto passengers
1656041 although the passenger demand grew by 3 8 this is the slowest growth that we have seen since the industry was hit by the sars severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis in 2003 with consumer and business confidence falling and sky high oil prices the situation will get a lot worse
1656042 from the outset nigeria had never owned bakassi we have never had the sovereignty over bakassi although we must admit that our people took possession of its western strip
1656043 but majorly the rest of bakassi which included the entire middle and eastern strips were never at any time inhabited by nigerians
1656044 that is what we will be doing by handling it over to cameroon
1656045 we have already released and allowed cameroon to take over 80 per cent of bakassi we have nothing to lose now by handing over the remaining zone to cameroon as the zone does not possess any crude oil contrary to speculations in some quarters

1656049 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
1656050 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1656051 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
1656052 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1656053 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
1656054 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
1656055 we are sad to see the remnant ore finally run out at wannaway
1656056 but it is really just the start of a new chapter in the life of this extraordinary mine we have high grade nickel intersections down below and we hope to see a new mineral resource take shape there in the months to come
1656057 in the meantime i want to pay tribute to the hard work skill and dedication of our wannaway team who have done a remarkable job of running the operation on a profitable remnant mining basis most impressively of all they have done it safely and to this day wannaway holds the record for the longest period without a lost time injury among all our mines

1656071 unless there is a radical transformation of existing business processes well in advance of any collaborative programme then a project is doomed to failure before it has even started collaboration introduces an entirely new way of working and this has a direct impact on the way people work how they interact with it and how they are trained businesses need to understand all these facets before undertaking a project of this nature user buy in is an absolute pre requisite to success
1656072 it policies also need to be reviewed this must encompass issues such as the appropriate use of email and instant messaging technologies as well as ensuring that the organisation has the capability to archive and monitor all communications
1656073 collaborative solutions should in fact eradicate the need for this sort of communications technology as everything can be captured on the collaboration platform which in turn will support many aups
1656074 collaborative solutions enable individuals and groups to interact in real time and keep a record of whatever they discuss and agree to do increased levels of communication and co operation between your employees partners and customers drives any organisation towards an anytime anywhere culture that delivers tangible business benefits
1656075 start with one technology area and then expand to others alternatively start with one business process and then add in others applying the collaborative technology as and when you assess the success of the initial projects the third option is to start with one business unit or group before large scale roll out
1656076 critical to this however is user acceptance and that will mean the radical transformation of traditional mindsets in a number of business areas not least human resources and the way employees interact the answer be prepared
1656077 weve started with what the mass market knows and understands scheduled tv and were introducing new consumption models woven into that familiar experience

1656083 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1656084 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1656085 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1656086 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1656087 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1656088 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country

1656090 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
1656091 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
1656092 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
1656093 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
1656094 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
1656095 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
1656096 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1656097 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
1656098 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1656099 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1656100 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1656101 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1656102 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1656103 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1656104 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1656105 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1656106 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable

1656118 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1656119 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1656120 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1656121 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1656122 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1656123 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1656124 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there

1656126 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1656127 it is a time when i have to be strong there is no obstacle in life that cant be surpassed and i am not going to let this take over me
1656128 speculators or more accurately financial investors are no fools just as in any other financial market so in the market for oil they are a consequence and not a cause of the tight underlying situation
1656129 they financial investors invest where they see good opportunities and divest where they see demand falling short of supply and therefore expect prices to fall
1656130 investors follow expectations which are following real developments and real production and consumption numbers
1656131 the people accused of carrying out this scheme worked out of several different countries and targeted retail operations without regard to jurisdiction with the worldwide reach of the internet criminals can now operate from almost anywhere on the globe to steal personal information from our citizens
1656132 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy
1656133 but even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals

1656138 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
1656139 we have communicated with dwight about his academic status changing and we have signed a release allowing unc to talk to him right now he is a member of our team and were going forward with that idea
1656140 is working with the ncaa and the eligibility center on this issue and hope to have it resolved soon
1656141 one minute he wasnt going to qualify so he had to get himself mentally prepared to go d ii
1656142 the destruction of the indians of the americas was far and away the gt most massive act of genocide in the history of the world
1656143 o xah why do you have to go out of the way gt to mention unpleasant facts
1656144 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
1656145 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
1656146 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1656147 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
1656148 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
1656149 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
1656150 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
1656151 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
1656152 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
1656153 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
1656154 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
1656155 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
1656156 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
1656157 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
1656158 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
1656159 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
1656160 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
1656161 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
1656162 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1656163 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
1656164 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1656165 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
1656166 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
1656167 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
1656168 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
1656169 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
1656170 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
1656171 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
1656172 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1656173 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
1656174 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
1656175 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1656176 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
1656177 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
1656178 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1656179 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
1656180 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1656181 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1656182 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
1656183 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
1656184 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
1656185 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
1656186 there is no mountain over which you can see the future

1656196 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1656197 one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1656198 please see our campaigns response to senator barack obamas insistence that if americans simply inflated their car tires it would be a more effective solution to americas energy crisis than expanding our domestic oil drilling capability
1656199 we would actually probably save more oil than all the oil that wed get from john mccain drilling
1656200 i said you could inflate your tires to the proper levels and that if everybody in america inflated their tires to the proper level we would actually probably save more oil than all the oil that wed get from john mccain drilling right below his feet wherever he was actually going to drill
1656201 instead of offering a real plan to lower gas prices the only energy plan that hes really promoting is more drilling
1656202 thats what he talked about yesterday i want to drill here i want to drill now i dont know where he was standing i think he was in a building somewhere
1656203 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america
1656204 meanwhile the oil companies already own drilling rights to 68 million acres of federal lands onshore and offshore that they havent touched 68 million acres that have the potential to nearly double americas total oil production and john mccain wants to give them more well that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than right here at yucca mountain
1656205 obama has said no to nuclear power he has said no to domestic supply on all fronts he is happier with higher gas prices
1656206 the destruction of the indians of the americas was far and away the gt most massive act of genocide in the history of the world

1656271 this project is very important to fujitsu which already has a 20 year old history in the introduction of new technologies in the top portuguese financial institutions this solution of cash management represented an additional challenge because it involved the local development of monitoring and resource agility tools that will be exported now to spain and italy

1656284 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
1656285 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
1656286 i think the fact dawkins in all his programs and interviews seem to emphasize to people and tell them that it is so obvious with the ludicrousness of religion and interviews people who believe in ghosts and so on and try to reason with them as to show the nonsensicalness
1656287 another problem is the way dawkins is calling people towards atheism the fact that science is a logical way to approach things and it is but calling people towards atheism in such a manner can turn atheism into something more organized and having something more organized can lead to a complacency in thinking and fall into all the traps religion have fallen into but nnot as much worse the way dawkins has categorized atheism and what it is and the role of it he has made it seem as so if someone was to question science they would be shot down i think the scientific method should be open to criticism and people like dawkins should advocate rather than make it the absolute position in ones thinking
1656288 the most obvious level is the modern disappearance of god as collective murder a little behind comes the collective murder of the pagan gods as the generative power behind their existence and way behind the most difficult level of all is the passion of jesus that cannot be the death of the christian god if the murders of the gods are always their birth but that could well be the death of all other gods in the banal sense we have in mind when we talk pf
1656289 a process of imaginative conjectures and empirical refutations advancing the truthlikeness of theories about reality but necessarily in a state of finite knowledge and infinite ignorance
1656290 1 the theory that physical matter is the only reality and that everything including thought feeling mind and will can be explained in terms of matter and physical phenomena
1656291 by the standard of empirical causality in science thats the best scientific explanation and has the most real meaning
1656292 the thesis that religious experiences are merely a hijacked response to concrete situations which stimulate natural cognitive processes is empirically testable and has real meaning whether or not its completely true is certainly debatable
1656293 as most of those who founded modern science and philosophy were christians
1656294 would have to conclude that there was some sort of designer personally guiding the process
1656295 whenever a theory appears to you as the only possible one take this as a sign that you have neither understood the theory nor the problem which it was intended to solve
1656296 a process of imaginative conjectures and empirical refutations advancing the truthlikeness of theories about reality but necessarily in a state of finite knowledge and infinite ignorance
1656297 in order to recognize an explanation as the best one neednt be able to explain the explanation in fact so requiring would lead to an infinite regress of explanations so that nothing could ever be explained and science would be destroyed so in the case at hand in order to recognize that intelligent design is the best explanation of the appearance of design in the universe one neednt be able to explain the designer

1656313 while the numbers dont yet show that the amendment 1 property tax reform created the economic sonic boom he promised gov charlie crist has thrown his support behind amendment 5 the proposal to replace school property taxes with higher taxes elsewhere it will be on the nov 4 ballot
1656314 crist has demonstrated he can persuade voters to cut their taxes but amendment 5 is a different animal it is a tax swap not a cut and it only hints at how the budgetary hole in public education would be plugged if the governors support for amendment 5 is sincere he needs to tell voters how he would fill in the blanks

1656446 the result must be that the overall average will be lower
1656447 if we represent this as only a probable and not a certain effect the reason for this is that we cannot exclude the possibility that the gain of that group of workers whose wages are pushed up beyond the level which would establish itself on a free market may be greater than the loss of the group whose wages will be lower than they would be if they had access to the prospering trade the increased wages of one group will thus certainly be bought at the expense of greater inequality and probably also at the price of a lower real income of the working class as a whole
1656448 even the groups whose wages have been advanced the most will probably be found when their unemployed are averaged with their employed members to be worse off than before
1656449 as far as i can make your thesis and its development out i dont agree with it i dont think that market equilibrium establishes differentials it establishes market wages period
1656450 therefore if someone is working at a job where his marginal revenue product is 50 000 he will tend to earn 50 000 and similarly for the man working at a 10 000 job the fact that the government might be taxing the first man 10 000 and paying the second one 2 000 doesnt affect the marginal revenue products or their market wages there is no hidden hand or any other reason why things must change to reestablish the alleged equilibrium differential the market is only concerned with marginal revenue products and not what happens to the persons income outside the market
1656451 now it is true that some 50 000 people might leave in disgust
1656452 but to do what if they drop out altogether there will be a cut in supply and a rise in mrp and wage rates but i cant believe that the effect will be very large certainly there is no market compulsion for it to be significantly large
1656453 also you seem to imply that the 50 000 people will leave in order to become 10 000 men which strikes me as absurd
1656454 i found it written with keen intelligence but i do have several difficulties the idea seems to depend on the existence of equilibrating forces operating upon income amounts while what economic theory recognizes is the operation of equilibrating forces upon factor prices you have not it seems to me demonstrated that redistribution necessarily distorts these prices

1656459 tadi waktu saya mati saya lihat sesuatu lepas dari tubuh saya
1656460 nih lihat ya aku mati untuk membuktikan bahwa tuhan tidak ada setan tidak ada surga tidak ada neraka tidak ada aku mati untuk memberitahu bahwa kalian adalah orang orang fanatik bodoh yang ditipu oleh pendeta
1656461 dan saya melihat tubuh saya terbujur kaku dan saya menembus plafon rumah ini
1656462 lho jeng sampean itu sampun sedo loh anda itu sudah meninggal
1656463 saya disambut tuhan yesus dan tuhan yesus berkata begini kepada saya
1656464 jeng sudah di surga engkau sudah berbahagia ayo jeng saya tunjukkan surga kepadamu
1656465 janganlah gelisah hatimu percayalah kepada allah percayalah juga kepada ku di rumah bapa ku banyak tempat tinggal jika tidak demikian tentu aku mengatakannya kepadamu sebab aku pergi ke situ untuk menyediakan tempat bagimu dan apabila aku telah pergi ke situ dan telah menyediakan tempat bagimu aku akan datang kembali dan membawa kamu ke tempat ku supaya di tempat di mana aku berada kamupun berada dan ke mana aku pergi kamu tahu jalan ke situ
1656466 ya jeng telah melakukan di dunia ini pekerjaanku aku memberikan upah bagi engkau sesuai apa yang engkau lakukan
1656467 sebab aku tuhan mencintai hukum dan membenci perampasan dan kecurangan aku akan memberi upahmu dengan tepat dan akan mengikat perjanjian abadi dengan kamu
1656468 tetapi tanpa iman tidak mungkin orang berkenan kepada allah sebab barangsiapa berpaling kepada allah ia harus percaya bahwa allah ada dan bahwa allah memberi upah kepada orang yang sungguh sungguh mencari dia
1656469 mbok iyem kapan ke balikpapan ayo bersaksi di tempat saya

1656471 urapan elia di akhir zaman karangan pdt samuel kusuma penerbit betlehem hal 47 61
1656472 saya akan datang kepadamu bayonet yang melintang di atas punggung saya tidak akan menjadi masalah lagi
1656473 janganlah gelisah hatimu percayalah kepada allah percayalah juga kepadaku di rumah bapa ku banyak tempat tinggal jika tidak demikian tentu aku mengatakannya kepadamu sebab aku pergi ke situ untuk menyediakan tempat bagimu dan apabila aku telah pergi ke situ dan telah menyediakan tempat bagimu aku akan datang kembali dan membawa kamu ke tempat ku supaya di tempat di mana aku berada kamupun berada
1656474 camkanlah aku sudah mengatakannya terlebih dahulu kepadamu jadi apabila orang berkata kepadamu lihat ia ada di padang gurun janganlah kamu pergi ke situ atau lihat ia ada di dalam bilik janganlah kamu percaya sebab sama seperti kilat memancar dari sebelah timur dan melontarkan cahayanya sampai ke barat demikian pulalah kelak kedatangan anak manusia
1656475 ketika mereka pengikut yesus sedang menatap ke langit waktu ia naik itu tiba tiba berdirilah dua orang yang berpakaian putih dekat mereka dan berkata
1656476 lihatlah ia datang dengan awan awan dan setiap mata akan melihat dia juga mereka yang telah menikam dia dan semua bangsa di bumi akan meratapi dia ya amin
1656477 pada waktu itu akan tampak tanda anak manusia di langit dan semua bangsa di bumi akan meratap dan mereka akan melihat anak manusia itu datang di atas awan awan di langit dengan segala kekuasaan dan kemulian nya
1656478 apabila anak manusia datang dalam kemuliaan nya dan semua malaikat bersama sama dengan dia maka ia akan bersemayam di atas takhta kemuliaan nya
1656479 tetapi tentang hari dan saat itu tidak seorangpun yang tahu malaikat malaikat di surga tidak dan anakpun tidak hanya bapa sendiri sebab itu hendaklah kamu juga siap sedia karena anak manusia datang pada saat yang tidak kamu duga
1656480 dan dia akan menyuruh keluar malaikat malaikatnya dengan meniup sangkakala yang dashyat bunyinya dan mereka akan mengumpulkan orang orang pilihannya dari keempat penjuru dunia dari ujung langit yang satu ke ujung langit yang lain
1656481 sebab pada waktu tanda diberi yaiitu pada waktu penghulu malaikat berseru dan sangkakala allah berbunyi maka tuhan sendiri akan turun dari sorga dan mereka yang mati dalam kristus akan lebih dahulu bangkit
1656482 sesudah itu kita yang hidup yang masih tinggal akan diangkat bersama sama dengan mereka dalam awan menyongsong tuhan di angkasa demikianlah kita akan selama lamanya bersama sama dengan tuhan
1656483 sesungguhnya aku menyatakan kepadamu suatu rahasia kita tidak akan mati semuanya tetapi kita semuanya akan diubah dalam sekejab mata pada waktu bunyi nafiri yang terakhir sebab nafiri akan berbunyi dan orang orang mati akan dibangkitkan dalam keadaan yang tidak dapat binasa dan kita semua akan diubah karena yang dapat binasa ini harus mengenakan yang tidak dapat binasa dan yang dapat mati ini harus mengenakan yang tidak dapat mati
1656484 aku akan datang kembali dan membawa kamu bersama ku di dalam rumah bapa ku
1656485 runtuhlah menimpa kami dan sembunyikanlah kami terhadap dia yang duduk di atas takhta dan terhadap murka anak domba itu
1656486 ia menghendaki supaya jangan ada yang binasa melainkan supaya semua orang berbalik dan bertobat
1656487 marilah kepada ku semua yang letih lesu dan berbeban berat aku akan memberi kelegaan kepadamu
1656488 demikian pula kristus hanya satu kali saja mengorbankan diri nya untuk menanggung dosa banyak orang sesudah itu ia akan menyatakan diri nya sekali lagi tanpa menanggung dosa untuk menganugerahkan keselamatan kepada mereka yang menantikan dia
1656489 lihat mereka melambai kepada kita mereka tahu siapa kita mereka datang untuk membawa kita
1656490 kedatangan nya dekat sekali saya dapat melihat para malaikat meniup terompet mereka
1656491 inilah tuhanku dia datang untuk saya bukan suatu hari nanti tetapi hari ini saat ini
1656492 dan tidak ada kekuatan di dunia ini yang dapat melawannya
1656493 dan apabila kamu berseru dan datang untuk berdoa kepadaku maka aku akan mendengarkan kamu apabila kamu mencari aku kamu akan menemukan aku apabila kamu menanyakan aku dengan segenap hati
1656494 oleh karena itu aku berkata kepadamu mintalah maka akan diberikan kepadamu carilah maka kamu akan mendapat ketoklah maka pintu akan dibukakan bagimu
1656495 lihat aku beridiri di muka pintu dan mengetok jikalau ada orang yang mendengar suaraku dan membukakan pintu aku akan masuk mendapatkannya dan aku makan bersama sama dengan dia dan ia bersama sama dengan aku
1656496 berdoa tanpa berkesudahan mengucap syukurlah dalam segala hal sebab itulah yang dikehendaki allah di dalam kristus yesus bagi kamu
1656497 dalam kebisingan di jalan di tengah pekerjaan bisnis kita dapat menaikkan permohonan kita kepada tuhan dan meminta bimbingannya kita harus terus membuka pintu hati dan mengundang kehadiran yesus dan tinggal sebagai tamu surgawi di hati kita
1656498 biarlah renunganku manis kedengaran kepadanya aku hendak bersukacita karena tuhan
1656499 bapa kami yang di surga dikuduskanlah namamu datanglah kerajaanmu jadilah kehendakmu di bumi seperti di surga berikanlah kami pada hari ini makanan kami yang secukupnya dan ampunilah kami akan kesalahan kami seperti kami juga mengampuni orang yang bersalah kepada kami dan janganlah membawa kami ke dalam pencobaan tetapi lepaskanlah kami dari pada yang jahat karena engkaulah yang empunya kerajaan dan kuasa dan kemuliaan sampai selama lamanya amin
1656500 sebab imam besar yang kita punya bukanlah imam besar yang tidak dapat turut merasakan kelemahan kelemahan kita sebaliknya sama dengan kita ia telah dicobai hanya tidak berbuat dosa sebab itu marilah kita dengan penuh keberanian menghampiri takhta kasih karunia supaya kita menerima rakhmat dan menemukan kasih karunia untuk mendapat pertolongan kita pada waktunya
1656501 tetapi jika engkau berdoa masuklah ke dalam kamarmu tutuplah pintu dan berdoalah kepada bapamu yang ada di tempat tersembunyi maka bapamu yang melihat yang tersembunyi akan membalasnya kepadamu
1656502 bergabung dengan orang lain dalam doa menciptakan ikatan khusus dan mengundang kuasa tuhan dalam cara khusus
1656503 sebab di mana dua atau tiga orang berkumpul dalam namaku di situ aku ada di tengah tengah mereka
1656504 jika kamu meminta sesuatu kepadaku dalam namaku aku akan melakukannya
1656505 jikalau kamu tinggal di dalam aku dan firmanku tinggal di dalam kamu mintalah apa saja yang kamu kehendaki dan kamu akan menerimanya
1656506 dan apa saja yang kamu minta dalam doa dengan penuh kepercayaan kamu akan menerimanya
1656507 dan inilah keberanian kepercayaan kita kepadanya yaitu bahwa ia mengabulkan doa kita jikalau kita meminta sesuatu kepadanya menurut kehendaknya
1656508 roh kudus akan menolongmu mengatasi hal yang mustahil dan allah yang menyelidiki hati nurani mengetahui maksud roh itu yaitu bahwa ia sesuai dengan kehendak allah berdoa untuk orang orang kudus
1656509 aku sangat menanti nantikan tuhan lalu ia menjenguk kepadaku dan mendengar teriakku minta tolong
1656510 sendainya ada niat jahat dalam hatiku tentulah tuhan tidak mau mendengar
1656511 atau kamu berdoa juga tetapi kamu tidak menerima apa apa karena kamu salah berdoa sebab yang kamu minta itu hendak kamu habiskan untuk memuaskan hawa nafsumu
1656512 siapa yang memalingkan telinganya untuk tidak mendengarkan hukum juga doanya adalah kekejian
1656513 berbahagialah orang yang lapar dan haus akan kebenaran karena mereka akan dipuaskan
1656514 karena janda ini terus menerus mengganggunya dan berbuat sesuatu agar janda itu mendapat keadilan
1656515 tidakkah allah akan membenarkan orang orang pilihannya yang siang malam berseru kepadanya dan adakah ia mengulur ulur waktu sebelum menolong mereka
1656516 aku telah mencari tuhan lalu ia menjawab aku dan melepaskan aku dari segala kegentaranku ia menyelamatkan dia dari segala kesesakannya
1656517 ingatlah jangan menganggap rendah seorang dari anak anak kecil ini karena aku berkata kepadamu ada malaikat mereka di surga yang selalu memandang wajah bapaku yang di surga
1656518 tuhan sudah dekat janganlah hendaknya kamu kuatir tentang apapu juga tetapi nyatakanlah dalam segala hal keinginanmu kepada allah dalam doa dan permohonan dengan ucapan syukur damai sejahtera allah yang melampaui segala akal akan memelihara hati dan pikiranmu dalam kristus yesus

1656528 it also could not have been achieved without the financial logistical and emotional support of the recording industry association of america aafes triwest health care alliance america supports you media base and sony manufacturing
1656529 i started making a few calls to friends of mine and six months later we have the cd for the troops
1656530 lets be honest there would be no songs of consequence without the soldiers who allow us a voice
1656531 i cant speak for anyone but myself but i think its important to recognize that artists from across the political spectrum came together to make this gesture of appreciation and thanks to our troops
1656532 inspires motivates provides an avenue for reflection or simply distracts you from a mission few can imagine much less undertake
1656533 if anything let each tune be a small piece of home to carry you forward
1656534 thank you for all you do and feel free to shoot me an e mail with requests for cd for the troops ii
1656535 it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit
1656536 meetings are indispensable when you dont want to do anything
1656537 these airlines have no choice but to start pulling down their least efficient biggest money losing routes which are the small aircraft in those short haul routes into small and medium sized cities
1656538 at 130 a barrel for oil the airlines tell me that there is no business model that works
1656539 weve already had our first casualty expressjet announced that they were ceasing operations in september they were pulling out of over 30 markets it wasnt just monterey
1656540 because companies arent going to move to an area that doesnt have good air service
1656541 if you didnt have a railroad and you werent connected to the rest of the rail system in the country your community died
1656542 we depend on aviation to get to the majority of our communities 280 of our communities its the only way in and out
1656543 basically what that means is that those communities have no service at this time at all and so it is truly a coming crisis for us
1656544 it doesnt belong to the ceos of the airlines it doesnt belong to the shareholders of the airlines it belongs to all americans
1656545 on average only three passengers are flying each of these flights so were paying a significant subsidy to fly mostly empty airplanes
1656546 consumers have already backed out of this theyre already going to the major airports
1656547 the only people who cant seem to back out of it is congress because this is a nice little gift to give their districts
1656548 homestar ruiner is a great series premiere and kick off for the season the next five months will be filled with lots of surprises
1656549 this is how we always envisioned episodic gaming monthly releases straight into the living room were happy to be working with the chapmans and nintendo to make it a reality
1656550 the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice
1656551 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
1656552 there arent that many great speeches anymore obama speaks well but it doesnt compare to mlk i wonder why that is
1656553 they want to know how high its gonna get because theyre hearing a lot of things people are talking outrageous numbers and they want to know if its true
1656554 in the early days of my career if a price moved half a cent or penny on a day that would be probably a lot
1656555 if youre within terms you can pick up oil and if youre not you can pound salt
1656556 and thats just the way it is i hope we never get to that point and have to deal with our customers that way but thats the way it is on the other side of our business
1656557 they may be buying oil at a higher price than they can sell it for or more likely the customer simply cant afford to buy it
1656558 so now they have oil they have to pay for and they cant get rid of
1656559 i think that they understand that were the middleman in this
1656560 we have probably another 10 to 20 years at least of life as we know it in the fuel business
1656561 ebay offered customers their own substores within the main web site
1656562 if you sit in the back you look like what you are somebody important enough to be driven
1656563 the last thing these people want to do is kill a large group of foreigners and invite international outrage

1656570 plus it is a very cost effective way to reach lots of people
1656571 you want to have an active and ongoing online discussion with your customers and suppliers
1656572 you want to give customers a recommended course of action and make them feel like they have a direct channel to your company
1656573 the old ways of hiring a public relations firm and putting out press releases just dont cut it anymore
1656574 todays businesses have to be more hands on grass roots interactive and maintain this flow of continuous communications
1656575 if you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate you are sure to wake somebody up

1656586 you think of web 2 0 ideas being on the fringe
1656587 if people enjoy the ads they should rise to the top like any other piece of content
1656588 except with ads that are both better targeted and nonintrusive you wont be interrupted like you are with tv
1656589 does this really make sense am i worrying about something that is ultimately irrelevant
1656590 it is not the strongest of the species that survive nor the most intelligent but the one most responsive to change
1656591 what would it be like if i tried to get the most out of this situation
1656592 on my website i offer free marketing articles and products for sale to help grow businesses

1656625 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1656626 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
1656627 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
1656628 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day

1656632 well i live in kesteren and for two years ive been playing for my club utrecht in the dutch meesterklasse i used to play for esgoo i have scored two im norms in 2006 at cappelle la grande and at the essent tournament in hoogeveen i could have scored a gm in the second one if i had drawn gurevich in the last round
1656633 until 2006 it was just going up and at some point i had a bit over 2400 but yes then it dropped a lot to 2310 now i was simply not very motivated and i had a busy period at school but i finished it in may and instead of going to university i decided to concentrate on chess again i want to be a chess professional for a year and i want to win back all my points this year
1656634 no in one tournament i have won 48 points already actually my goal is to become a grandmaster now
1656635 yes i like to set high standard form myself if i just say i want to become an im that doesnt make sense i will do that anyway and then there would be nothing to play for
1656636 well i dont think so especially not those two i had beaten some strong players already like sandipan and brandenburg so i guess they knew what form i was in ok doel avoided a perpetual but that was timetrouble and yes he did want to beat me in that crucial game of course
1656637 well it wasnt so easy apparently sosonko looked at the game like i did without paying attention to whites defensive possibilities
1656638 well thats a difficult question actually i think it was because i was feeling very well and i was only thinking about the tournament i wasnt distracted by other things like school or sports friends or tv
1656639 since i was a youth player trainers have advised me to play 1 d4 because they think im a d4 player ive never started looking at it because it takes so much time now i decided to go for it although i havent been able to study it thoroughly yet its not really part of my success no because if you look at my openings its clear that i only got promising positions out of the opening when i played 1 e4
1656640 well the usual training provided by the dutch chess federation i have worked with yge visser ruud janssen arhur jussupow and vladimir chuchelov
1656641 well the win against brandenburg was good it was a correct game but against sandipan was the best result of course because that was the start of a fantastic tournament
1656642 hey america soy paris hilton y tambi n soy una celebridad

1656647 there might be one or two things that havent leaked yet
1656648 no one should even think they know the subject of the talk

1656664 the court of arbitration for sport cas has upheld the appeals filed by schalke 04 werder bremen and barcelona against the decision issued on july 30 2008 by the single judge of fifas players status committee that consequently has been set aside in its entirety
1656665 beijing 2008 is not included in the co ordinated match calendar and there is no specific decision of the fifa executive committee establishing the obligation for the clubs to release players under 23 for this tournament the requirements to justify a legal obligation of clubs to release their players for the olympics on the basis of customary law are not met
1656666 in view of fifas recommendation made to the clubs to release their players as well as of the olympic spirit cas calls upon the good will and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country in the olympic games
1656667 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1656668 with the goal of bringing down prices at the pump

1656673 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1656674 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1656675 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1656676 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1656677 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1656678 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets

1656784 our peace panel had messed up this thing very badly it had brought the situation to a critical point it is now a matter of national security concern the rapport between the our grp panel and the milf panel is already lost indicated by the difference in opinion on what is a done deal the milf says it is a done deal our opapp is saying and they are right in saying that this is not yet a done deal
1656785 the credibility of the opapp and the present panel is already in question not only by the people officials and non governmental organizations of this country but by the milf itself so we need to reconstitute the opap and the panel
1656786 i have raised this issue back in may 19 2008 to the point that i thought that by appointing gen esperon as head of the opapp the president might have been junking the peace process with the milf
1656787 i think there is a need to reconstitute not only the head but all the members of the office of the presidential adviser for the peace process including its legal panel engaging the milf to peace talks because if this peace process had been properly thought of or thought about then maybe it will not be as messed up as it is today

1656864 that was the week that we had decided to throw our hat in the ring officially with chase and say heres our guy
1656865 we had a great year as a team and designed some color flyers and brochures and mailed them out to as many voters as we could find and national media types and we handed them out in the press box
1656866 chase had a great game and threw for four touchdowns but maclin was just all over the place
1656867 thats the game plan for jeremy this year hes on some lists and some say hes a dark horse and we think hes worthy of mention well focus on chase initially and if jeremy is in a position for us to do some things for him toward the middle of the year we certainly will do it
1656868 weve got some ideas that were throwing around right now
1656869 everybody knows these guys so were not looking for awareness now but we do have some ideas weve been tossing around and one is very clever its a way to get both of them out there at the same time without choosing one over the other
1656870 they have to look and say this kid caught this many touchdowns but this kid threw them what is going to sway people more whats going to dazzle people
1656871 were not going to pick sides our campaign will show that
1656872 i hope we have at least two that we can win with

1656875 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference

1656877 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set its the stuff of evolution
1656878 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1656879 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1656888 im very happy to sign for fulham ive already spent three weeks with the team and we have a very good squad for the new season
1656889 i know the club had a very hard season last year but im confident that this season it will be much much better im coming here to be successful
1656890 i know also the situation here with the goalkeepers ive known mark schwarzer for a long time and played against him in the past
1656891 i know hes the number one but im here to give my best so that in the end the team is successful
1656892 were probably one or two quality players short on the frontline but were not going to be held to ransom either by a player or a club
1656893 everyone is looking for goalscorers at this time of year its a nervy time for every manager all you can do is keep calm and keep doing your homework
1656894 its not a bottomless pit of money that weve got available and we believe every player has a valuation
1656895 there is a lot of competition now in all areas of the squad and the club needs that to improve
1656896 we have a bigger squad now which is good news for the season ahead
1656897 i think we have got enough quality and enough good players to try and get into the top ten of the premier league
1656898 we have to make that our mission if we work hard and have a good spirit we can achieve that we really can

1657131 ive found that when the outer fabric wets out the condensation increases in all membrane coated fabrics all types of gore tex event sympatex all the pu coatings but i have found that it builds up slower in event however all garments need reproofing when the dwr wears off or condensation appears much more quickly i dont think event needs reproofing any more often than other fabrics it all depends on how long the dwr lasts however even with a good dwr and no wetting out i can still produce much condensation in all these fabrics especially in prolonged rain paramo is far more breathable and my first choice as long as its cold enough mostly october to may the oddest one of these fabrics is paclite i find this very breathable and condensation free for a time but once condensation does appear it gets very wet inside very quickly in other fabrics the build up is slower and more regular
1657132 i havent noticed fabrics that breathe well wetting out sooner i have noticed steam coming off garments that breathe well this has happened with buffalo clothing never with membranes or coatings with membranes the most breathable garments i have ever used were ones with a waterproof breathable inner and a separate windproof outer like the paramo construction but with a membrane inner rab and craghoppers both made garments like this using sympatex and permatex with these garments the wetting out of the outer didnt make anything like as much difference to the breathability as with garments where the membrane is laminated to the outer these garments were tough i used a rab one on my round of the munros and tops ten years ago and it was still waterproof at the finish

1657138 it is quite obvious that you dont touch a car through a high speed corner like that he tapped richo unsettled him and turned him around someone of his experience shouldnt be making a mistake like that
1657139 we bumped as he went passed me and then i needed to get in line behind him the car has bad bump control at that point of the track and there was a little bit of contact but i didnt think there was enough for him to spin but the cars are very unsettled there
1657140 the sooner he retires the better off well all be
1657141 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1657142 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are a unique opportunity for a player as they are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player and his national team who can benefit from such an experience but also his club
1657143 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1657144 in june i was fortunate enough to attend several uefa euro 2008 matches and i was delighted to witness a high standard of play the wonderful peaceful atmosphere both inside and outside the stadiums as well as the excellent organisational skills of the austrian and swiss hosts

1657177 for whatever reason i have been given a unique opportunity to fight this i feel a responsibility in a way and want to help others that pushes me along
1657178 if the industry tries to keep up the strategy of you need us badly and therefore we make the rules you will lose the artists their managers and the audience another 12 months for this radiohead experiment to become the default approach get engaged or get outmoded and do it soon
1657179 i have spoken with maureen ogara based on go ahead from brianv and planted the story
1657180 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1657181 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1657182 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1657183 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club
1657184 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1657185 the olympic tournament doesnt feature in the official fifa calendar and there is no executive decision by fifa which establishes a right of release for under 23 players for this tournament
1657186 consequently schalke 04 werder bremen and barcelona are not obliged to release the players rafinha diego and messi
1657187 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1657188 the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result
1657189 the entire team backs him hes one of the best in the world i dont know what is going on with the club but hes very important to the team
1657190 in this world nothing is unchanging the decision is up to the technical staff the sports dimension will always prevail samuels attitude is good and i appreciate his bahaviour
1657191 the best solution for etoo would be if he was sold before the champions league preliminary games the market is about to close and were considering many options with pep guardiola
1657192 we are waiting for this agreement if he moves itll be to a big club of course
1657193 my opinion has not changed etoo is with us at the moment and as long as he is a barcelona player we will try to get the best performance out of him
1657194 with two years of back to back competitive racing events in tandem with the bicycle industrys trade event interbike and the industry are helping vegas cultivate a culture of cycling
1657195 now that the show will be held in las vegas for a few more years we welcome crossvegas and swagger in making the city famous for great cycling events
1657196 with the addition of the wheelers and dealers race and the shuttle buses from the sands crossvegas is an even bigger part of the interbike experience
1657197 nobody should show up at interbike the day after the race and hear the words you shouldve been there
1657198 last years industry cup had some fierce racing with ex pros manufacturers independent reps and shop owners and staff racing each other
1657199 this year i wonder if last years racers and any new comers are willing to put their money where their mouths are and show us whos the fastest
1657200 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
1657201 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
1657202 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
1657203 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
1657204 until i have a fuller detailed explanation of the timeline and the alleged activities that went on its a little difficult for me to comment
1657205 the bottom line is they went in without a warrant and they arrested us without charges and they took our property without charges
1657206 why did this happen and what do we need to do to get back in there

1657230 we have been advising clients to book some profit after the market had risen so much so fast
1657231 people preferred to wait till tomorrow to see the inflation numbers
1657232 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1657233 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1657234 in the absence to a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for our incentives package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1657235 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next step
1657236 the phone talks today will be to decide on a common reponse there is the possibility of trying to send the matter back to the security council but there is always the problem of persuading china and russia
1657237 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures

1657247 in the world of developers i dont think it would have mattered if i wanted to allow blogging to happen or not but i think its been a great way for us to communicate to our customers and for our customers more importantly to communicate with us
1657248 we trust our people to represent our company so in a sense you dont run any more risk letting someone express themselves on a blog than you do letting them go out and see a costumer on their own

1657254 speculators or more accurately financial investors are no fools just as in any other financial market so in the market for oil they are a consequence and not a cause of the tight underlying situation
1657255 they financial investors invest where they see good opportunities and divest where they see demand falling short of supply and therefore expect prices to fall
1657256 there is terrific demand from all over the country and from everyone
1657257 people feel gold could bounce back as it has done so in the past from around these levels
1657258 if it stays like this the festival season demand may be good
1657259 this year we dont expect a drastic fall in profit we expect the profit to be maintained approximate to last years
1657260 our sharp fall in profit is not because of losses but because of mark to market provisions
1657261 since its only a book entry once the securities mature we expect money will flow back

1657278 he was one of our strongest personalities a unique person
1657279 our offer is clear and their response is not clear
1657280 the iranian government needs to respond in a very clear way to the generous offer from the international community
1657281 as predicted it basically says yes we will give you an answer but when you give us an answer
1657282 there is no public transport the mining industry is closing down
1657283 we have a limited attendance at our four mines in south africa
1657284 i do support the message not the strike they shouldnt have stopped the transport
1657285 these strikes will probably do more damage than good because all we do is send a message that were a strike prone country and its not good for the image of south africa
1657286 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide
1657287 did we for example systematically take the side of one camp against another hutu against tutsi that is an untruth
1657288 did we fail to denounce the genocide committed by hutu extremists starting in april 1994 that is an untruth
1657289 did we remain passive when the rest of the international community was taking action that is an untruth
1657290 during my time as head of french diplomacy from april 1993 to may 1995 we did everything we could to help the reconciliation of rwandans

1657316 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1657317 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1657318 we have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law
1657319 the supreme court has ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules
1657320 its silence is no surprise the united states has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access
1657321 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1657322 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jose medellins execution goes forward
1657323 for the precedent it could set for the rights of mexican nationals that could be detained
1657324 obama said a couple of days ago says we all should inflate our tires i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
1657325 so the production offset is more likely to approach 800 thousand barrels per day a tidy sum and a worthwhile target for savings but not equal to ocs output
1657326 finally without knowing what production volumes could be expected from lifting the ban on ocs drilling moratoria its impossible to assert that taking these fuel savings actions would exceed future offshore oil volumes and in fact one might argue that the combination of achieving these savings and developing new supply would doubly enhance us energy security

1657332 the way 06 went we kind of caught lightning in a bottle and everything we did went right
1657333 i think going into 07 we took that for granted and that things were going to go the same way
1657334 after one year we should be better in 07 and thing didnt happen that way so i think this year were going to learn a lesson from 2007 which wasnt fun at the time but if i can learn a lesson from it itll help this year
1657335 my first year coming here and getting thrown into things thrown into the fire it was just a kind of thing that i was playing about 100 miles an hour and i knew i was going to make mistakes
1657336 last year i understood the system better but i think i got to the point where i was overthinking and trying not to make any mistakes it led to not making as many plays
1657337 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
1657338 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
1657339 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
1657340 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
1657341 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
1657342 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
1657343 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
1657344 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
1657345 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
1657346 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
1657347 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
1657348 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
1657349 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

1657382 i can confirm today that mr rudolph dixon has been charged with two counts of misconduct in a public office and two counts of doing an act tending and intended to pervert the course of public justice
1657383 with regards to mr burmon scott he will not be charged and is no longer a suspect in this case
1657384 im so glad i can show up now and breathe
1657385 im just happy my name has been cleared and that im able to get on with my life
1657386 it is met police and it will remain met police
1657387 the met has been and will remain independent right the way through
1657388 his employment conditions still remain exactly the same although that could change for the moment the governor has said nothing it may simply be related to what mr bridger and the met police have been working on all along and this is a natural progression of the investigation
1657389 concerning commissioner stuart kernohan and chief superintendent john jones their case is still under investigation and we are making progress it is however important to note that this investigation remains totally separate from the case against mr dixon and as such it has a completely different timeline
1657390 mr lyndon martin will appear in court again on thursday 21 august for a pi preliminary inquiry hearing
1657391 i will just say that anyone in the country who has any information regarding the integrity of the royal cayman islands police can come forward and speak to my team and i guarantee their anonymity
1657392 i applaud the courage of those who have approached my team with information
1657393 that information is currently being assessed at the end of which decisions will be taken as how to take matters forward
1657394 the ambulance driver saved everybody because if he didnt do what he did everyone would have died
1657395 at that time i could hear the ambulance coming but i couldnt see it
1657396 he never reacted to the sound of the horn and continued to make the u turn at a slow pace
1657397 the ambulance driver had no other option but to make a severe swerve that hit the front of the car and completely turned it around
1657398 with a working fleet of three ambulances the response capabilities of the islands emergency medical services team will not be compromised and contingency arrangements have been made for additional support as a result of the loss of one of the ambulances on sunday
1657399 the emergency medical service has always had three ambulances for full island wide coverage with one back up unit available when one of the units is out of commission the loss of this unit will not significantly affect our response capabilities
1657400 recognizing the critical role of our emergency response in saving lives within the critical hour it is important that our response capabilities remain robust and the minister of health has given his support in our efforts to obtain a replacement in the shortest possible time frame to ensure optimal resources are available to meet the medical needs of our community
1657401 the portfolio of finance and economics on behalf of government assures the public that it is addressing concerns raised by the recently issued auditor generals special report state of financial accountability reporting
1657402 the portfolio continues to consult with all stakeholders in respect of the matters raised in the report at present this is all that the portfolio wishes to add to its press release of 18 july

1657404 i have meetings scheduled all this week in support of this matter although its not as though the auditor generals report prompted this for the first time weve been having these meetings for quite some time
1657405 i dont want to comment on that the chairman of the public accounts committee said he would conduct meetings
1657406 sure some people have provided financial statements but they are incomplete we still need their supporting schedules we have written to some of these people a dozen times but we never get the supporting documents
1657407 i give you 50 you go out and spend it then tell me you spent it but never give me the receipt
1657408 we are simply looking for what is required by law the outputs are required by law and financial statements are not complete without them we sometimes get the financials but have to write back and say theyre incomplete we cannot do the audit without the output statements

1657420 atmospheric and somewhat dramatic this british band fills out the britpop sound yes they sound a little like early radiohead maybe doves but theres a heavier moodier element
1657421 rich in texture and flawless in rhythm theres a bit of doves in there a little bit of sigur ros but this is a band that have found their own sound laid back progressive indie that grabs the listener with its originality

1657446 die landeshauptstadtrangliste im fu ball 2008 teil i von iii
1657447 starting off quite strong although a little impatient for this level of play alain stayed with his opponent and executed some great shots even with his opponents athletic ability
1657448 alain showing no signs of injury but slow onto the ball lost 3 0 with a bit more patience and a deeper base game alain should provide a much stronger chance of upsetting our next opponents
1657449 with a great start to the first game cameron played a safe basic game bringing his opponent to the front of the court with caution by the second game cameron was starting to puff which his opponent could see wian pulled away in the third game to win 3 0 cameron fought hard but the pass finally outdid him
1657450 jake was very keen to begin with although a few careless errors finished the first game quicker than expected with the second game jake was finally playing stronger than we have seen him
1657451 with endless lengths of the court covered jake managed to bring the second game to 8 8
1657452 in the third game jake tried to maintain the pass against his opponent but a three minute injury from the forehand corner enabled hergeth to bounce back following his rest period to win 3 0
1657453 cameron played very steady all the way through to win 3 1
1657454 alains opponent seemed on a mission at the beginning of the match winning quite convincingly in the first alain needed to pick up the pace and managed to stay with his opponent but in the end unforced errors proved to be alains weakness
1657455 off with a bad start with too many errors and impatience jake begun to steady up and play a more sage game in order to settle in his opponent continued to play a solid game with no unforced errors jake looked to take the ball to the front too early which opened the court and in turn put jake under further pressure

1657479 my wife worked in portland for 5 years at nikes world headquarters and lived by the famed 23rd street
1657480 she knows first hand that business districts like the short vine area near such a large concentration of young people at uc would likely undergo the quintessential streetcar transformation and that there is a large difference between running the car up jefferson vs the business district in terms of the benefit to the business district
1657481 im in the growing minority of young professionals who is trying to move back into the city
1657482 while we all understand that kroger and others need to mind their bottom line im afraid that bigger opportunities and benefits even to kroger are being missed because people dont believe in the streetcar here

1657532 dependemos de nosotros pero todos los equipos dependen de s mismos porque estamos a cero los resultados de estados unidos impresionan pero yo remarco que hay que ir poco a poco en lo primero que hay que pensar es el partido contra grecia el objetivo que tenemos es intentar clasificarnos entre los cuatros primeros si lo conseguimos ya hablaremos

1657563 real ale is a natural living product so there is a much greater intensity of flavours
1657564 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1657565 a processed keg beer is completely inert a dead flat liquid drawn up to bar with carbon dioxide to put some life in it
1657566 we thought it would be a laugh trying the different beers
1657567 its broadened my horizons you can have one to enjoy it rather than go out on a binge night on it
1657568 im interested in tasting a variety of beers you cant get these ales at the local pub or in a supermarket its a rare opportunity to try some of them
1657569 a lot of commercial lagers are 90 percent advertising 10 percent flavour im surprised they sell it for as much as they do
1657570 golden brown session beer full bodied with an aroma of floral hops initial malty flavour fades as citrus and hops take over leading to a hoppy bitter finish
1657571 its one of the hardest beers to brew because there are fewer ingredients in it and weve managed to put a lot of flavour into a low alcohol beer and keep it consistent
1657572 tick tock tick tock heheheh tick tock tick tock hehehehehe
1657573 we must exit iraq but not in a way that leaves behind a security vacuum filled with terrorism chaos ethnic cleansing and genocide that could engulf large swaths of the middle east and endanger america we have both moral and national security reasons to manage our exit in a responsible way
1657574 to safeguard the freedom and security of its member countries by political and military means
1657575 the u s jihadist war is entering its final phase
1657576 the destruction of al qaedas strategic capabilities now allows the to begin drawing down its middle eastern forces
1657577 no amount of white house spin can hide the fact that the escalations chief objective of political reconciliation remains unmet iraqis have not demonstrated any readiness to stand up and take responsibility for their own country and 2007 was the most lethal year yet for american troops

1657581 notwithstanding the game slips and the likely delay of a return to profitability for another year we remain cautiously optimistic that midway will perform better in 2009 than it is expected to perform in 2008
1657582 i have no doubts in my mind that at its core and for everything that it provides that fallout is a better game than oblivion was for sure
1657583 has a legal and moral obligation to make official statements first to the victims and their families then the public
1657584 and thats the order in which were going to do it
1657585 safe efficient inexpensive and obviously a vital ingredient in the future of the economy of our nation and in our mission to eliminate over time our dependence on foreign oil
1657586 if we really want to enable new technologies tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1657587 nuclear power represents more than 70 percent of our noncarbon generated electricity it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1657588 and what weve got to figure out is can we store the material properly can we make sure that theyre secure can we deal with the expense
1657589 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1657590 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1657591 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1657592 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1657593 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1657594 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1657595 his schedule hasnt been set for next week let alone next month
1657596 americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1657597 this has other personal numbers that could give them access to credit or debit cards that have already been issued and are active
1657598 the defendants then used these cards to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atms
1657599 identity theft can involve a single criminal stealing the personal financial information of a single victim or as it did here it can involve a group of criminals stealing the credit card numbers of millions of people many of whom may not even learn that they were victims for months or years
1657600 identity theft victims suffer well beyond the immediate financial costs they suffer lost confidence in their privacy and security as well as the emotional strain and the time it can take to repair damaged financial lives and credit histories in many cases the effects of these crimes can be felt for years after they are committed
1657601 there are ties between all three districts and ties internationally that go all the way to the ukraine and latvia
1657602 the 41 million credit and debit numbers were used internationally
1657603 we have been working with countries around the world to identify and address technical vulnerabilities in computer networks and to ensure that laws and procedures are adequate to deal with these kinds of crime
1657604 and we have been working closely with our international partners to crack specific cases when they take us beyond our borders
1657605 the internet industry should by no means stand in the opposite camp against the music industry
1657606 google always believes profoundly that mutual interest rather than monopoly is the key to sustainable growth
1657607 misusing of an arm of government the kind of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1657608 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter is absurd
1657609 ultimately habbush could not offer proof that weapons that didnt exist didnt exist
1657610 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
1657611 i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter
1657612 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
1657613 the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1657614 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1657615 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1657616 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1657617 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1657618 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions

1657622 this is a great way of getting children out in the open air and gives them a chance to nurture something
1657623 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek
1657624 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1657625 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1657626 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1657627 state and federal courts on three separate occasions have already satisfied the world courts suggestion that american courts examine whether medellin suffered actual legal harm when authorities did not inform him about certain rights under the vienna convention
1657628 on all three occasions state and federal courts concluded that medellin suffered no legal harm
1657629 i work hard for those moments i like those moments its special today thats what i want to do try to help the team win
1657630 the most important thing to me is to stay healthy

1657632 it changes the game hes one of the big superstars in the game i think moreso than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark he loosens us up with his charisma and character before and after the game hes a huge part of who we are
1657633 he didnt really have good command ill say that much and sometimes when you dont have command and you dont make quality pitches it hurts you sometimes
1657634 were happy that people took the time to watch the news releases about this case and actually acted by calling and giving us tips
1657635 in this case it would have been very tough for us to get to the point where were at today without the news media they played a very important role in this case by getting the information out
1657636 i believe her biggest contribution is serving the people whether it was in politics or an office whatever she does she does with all her heart
1657637 in this interesting one party arrangement we have in government ruth has been a very able representative of the people
1657638 she mentored me in a sense because i would go to her for advice
1657639 even to get her to sign up for chief deputy i had to talk her into it
1657640 and i know long into her first term she wanted to see the juvenile center built and she has put a lot into that thats a good example of her wanting to finish what she starts
1657641 certainly deeply involved in the juvenile facility and when she leaves her fingerprints will be on the project
1657642 shes been a big influence on people and had a big influence on the decisions that weve made and were going to miss her a whole lot
1657643 im the first to admit that the last few weeks have been crazy

1657661 clearly brett favres popularity in wisconsin has taken an enormous hit over the last several weeks
1657662 they told him well trade you but not within the division
1657663 his first desire was to play here their first desire was for him not to play here
1657664 i just think brett feels like this reporting to packers camp isnt working
1657665 that basically he was not in the right mindset to play here because of all of the things that went on
1657666 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1657667 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time
1657668 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id see it basically the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1657669 its not as simple as no 4 running out there playing football
1657670 hes a great football player i loved coaching him loved seeing him play we talked about all of those things but its a situation that is extremely personal for him the path to get to where we are has done some damage thats where he is
1657671 reviving the housing market must be central to the economic revival plan we are promised for the autumn
1657672 for most people the acquisition of a house is the biggest single investment they will make
1657673 for most people the acquisition of a house is the biggest single investment they will make homeowners rightly expect their investment to be protected by sensible policies pursued by government
1657674 i am determined that as a country we never return to the instability speculation and negative equity that characterised the housing market in the 1980s and 1990s
1657675 volatility is damaging both to the housing market and to the economy as a whole
1657676 so stability will be central to our policy to help homeowners and we must be prepared to take the action necessary to secure it
1657677 i will not allow house prices to get out of control and put at risk the sustainability of the recovery

1657694 i was lucky to get through it but it made me stronger and i hope wiser i had a lot of demons to fight maybe that is why this character is my favorite role so far there is a definite theme of max fighting the devils inside theres a lot of action in this movie but theres also plenty of emotion and psychology it goes pretty deep
1657695 ive spent my 20s on tour and theres no consistency in my life which can take its toll
1657696 eventually i want to focus on being a completely different person because i dont want to be doing this into my 40s and 50s and beyond like the rolling stones
1657697 i dont want to give it up just yet though i think we have a little more to say
1657698 ive always found it strange when people ask how come you know these people
1657699 i dont understand how anybody hasnt at some stage had something to do with villains

1657703 software engineering has evolved from being highly prized to being just another skill set and compensation has been adjusted accordingly

1657706 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
1657707 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy it wasnt designed to titillate
1657708 anybody not inclined to see a movie with porno in the title is not going to see it so it kind of regulates itself to a degree and anybody who is going is not going to be surprised by what they see

1657738 these finds are massively important in the ice age the cold conditions meant that water was locked up in the ice caps the sea level was lower then so in some places what is now the seabed was dry land the hand axes would have been used by hunters in butchering the carcasses of animals like mammoths
1657739 although we dont yet know their precise date we can say that these hand axes are the single most important find of ice age material from below the north sea
1657740 these are exciting finds which help us gain a greater understanding of the north sea at a time when it was land we know people were living out there before britain became an island but sites actually proving this are rare
1657741 the hand axes were collected over a three month period and this remarkable discovery only came to light in february when mr meulmeester realising their importance informed the wharf owners as we manage our dredging very carefully we were quickly able to identify the area where the finds came from as part of our industrys protocol with english heritage we have now moved dredging to another part of the seabed
1657742 despite their best efforts i can confirm that armstrong watson has been instructed to assist the directors in placing carlisle liberal club ltd into a members voluntary liquidation
1657743 unfortunately the club has extensive debts approaching 300 000 and has been losing on average 40 000 per year
1657744 there is no other option than to wind up the business before it becomes insolvent and unable to pay its debts
1657745 we are in the early stages of discussing the clubs sale to an independent purchaser and we expect to have more concrete information ahead of the members meeting on september 3
1657746 the programme itself has always been very interactive so its about extending that onto other platforms the site will be bigger than ever this year with a huge amount of exclusive video content
1657747 i hope that promoting the fact that people can get x factor goodies on their mobile will raise awareness of the platform weve changed the site because its important to keep it fresh
1657748 our trade partners have not been overwhelmed with cancellations but it is a very sensitive situation
1657749 we are going to take a look at things next week at this stage we are reviewing our marketing activities
1657750 we cannot control the economic environment in which we operate as a result of the recent slowdown in the television advertising market the board has taken some tough decisions which are reported here today
1657751 mobile for instance can be an obvious planning function but developing a wap site would sit with the interactive services unit
1657752 so we have formed virtual teams to provide best practice in areas like mobile and social media
1657753 phase one of placing digital alongside traditional channels has been about migrating the team
1657754 the next stage is cross skilling media managers digital is no longer an afterthought but central to communications
1657755 we werent geared up to take advantage of the likes of bauer and channel 4 offering cross platform opportunities and we need to be arranged more efficiently to be able to spot those
1657756 it was a tragic incident that somebody could be absent for so long without being noticed it is very sad
1657757 as with many statistical indicators the raw figures do not tell the whole story and this is only one way of measuring officers time on frontline policing
1657758 the definition of front line does not include a whole range of operational activities such as crime prevention activities dealing with those taken into custody and attending court all are essential to deliver policing in our communities
1657759 the constabularys success in lowering crime arresting and putting before the courts more people would not be achieved without police officers time in custody units and attending court
1657760 the important issue the indicator does not address is what our officers are doing when they are out and visible in communities
1657761 were using platform a to educate the market they have the option to buy glasses online
1657762 sites still vary in what they allow you to do with video ads so bringing in standards means we can cut down on having to produce the same ad four times to fit different sites
1657763 by the time this is brought in and accepted by everyone well have moved on to something else we continually want to push what we can do with ad formats so spending time bringing in standards is a slightly outdated tv way of doing things
1657764 its inappropriate to impose guidelines onto a digital medium when one of its strengths is its versatility unlike traditional broadcast where its monetisation is based on time segments
1657765 we want to encourage more schools to come to avebury world heritage site and ensure that pupils have an educational and stimulating visit
1657766 the site is steeped in a rich and mysterious history and there is so much children can learn from a visit here this new web resource will help them to discover the sites historical significance using fun learning tools
1657767 pupils from two primary schools and a secondary school visited while the work was in progress the visit really helped the children to get an in depth learning experience of the mysterious hill
1657768 so we thought it would be great if we could create a teachers kit which encourages active learning for visits to the whole world heritage site

1657772 i have never fought in my life he knocked me to the ground and beat hell out of my face and that made me mad
1657773 it seems that in this case the issue is whether the defendant was acting in lawful self defence we say the suggestion that mr bragg at 61 attacked this 39 year old body builder is a complete invention
1657774 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women who may be experiencing abuse now or who may do so in the future to reach out and get help
1657775 portraying a victim of domestic violence has been the biggest challenge i have ever faced as an actress
1657776 just playing the role has taken a huge emotional toll on my life but it is nothing compared to the pain fear and torment experienced by the hundreds of women refuge supports every day
1657777 its horrific to think that two women are killed every week in england and wales by their current or former partner but i truly believe that the more women who know about refuges early warning signs campaign the more lives can be saved
1657778 andy began by gradually isolating jo stopping her from making friends questioning her about where she was going and what she was wearing and constantly expecting her to answer for her actions
1657779 by the time the physical violence began he already had jo under his control hitting her was yet another technique to make her more frightened more scared and more alone
1657780 jo is a strong and feisty character but the abuse she is experiencing is wearing her down and eroding her self confidence so even when people try to help her she is too scared and manipulated by andy to reach out for help
1657781 i know from my work with refuge that the walking on egg shells life that jo is leading is all too common for so many women
1657782 in order to refit the units that are there we are looking at upwards of 7 000
1657783 this is probably the toughest test this shop has seen in its history
1657784 we specialise in cuban cigars and like to show people the different thicknesses and lengths and if you lock it all away where do you go
1657785 even loose tobacco people want to open it feel it and smell it that will be completely lost now
1657786 banning the display of tobacco would not reduce youth smoking it has been tried in other parts of the world and has failed
1657787 however these measures would be very costly and highly impractical for small shops
1657788 the government needs to look at other ways of reducing youth smoking and find a solution that works with small businesses not against them
1657789 theyve obviously been taken for pets because theyve taken everything

1657806 they the government have wasted 130 days saying they were going to restore the judges now they have dropped the judges to talk about impeachment this government cannot even make small decisions so how are they going to make such a big one
1657807 do you think i could fight an army with those trucks
1657808 you cant go from a lieutenant all the way to a general at once

1657814 thats a big negative vote against the yahoo board but it doesnt change anything
1657815 it is a statement that they shouldnt be under any illusion that their support is broad
1657816 the recount somewhat lowers the credibility of the management team
1657817 assuming this was all a mistake it is particularly unfortunate management doesnt have the mandate they appeared to have had
1657818 upon review it was determined that there was a truncation error in the final printout sent to the tabulator
1657819 this resulted in the under reporting of shares withheld for certain directors
1657820 for the next several quarters there is going to be more noise especially with the stock below 20
1657821 we have irrefutable evidences that large scale military action will commence here exactly by september it is the plan of georgia and it is the plan that saakashvilis regime is implementing today
1657822 it just gives you more information you can use as youre trying to make a decision
1657823 we can take the different layers and put layers on top of each other and do analysis
1657824 they did this for penfield free of charge to see how the program works
1657825 gives us the chance to determine things like drainage patterns proximity to streets and woodlands and assists us in learning where some of the more sensitive features might be

1657827 not only is virtutech taking a lead in driving development standards for the vsd industry were also continually raising the performance bar for vsd with updates to the simics platform and in the game changing ways our customers and partners are deploying simics
1657828 virtutech simics remains the only electronic systems development platform that allows for a revolutionary change in the product development process at a full system level rather than a component level
1657829 virtualized software development is an important advance in the development and maintenance of applications for electronic devices

1657996 komplett abgeschlossen ist der 1 bauabschnitt die sanierung der 67 wohnungen in den eing ngen der kranichstra e 24 bis 27 sowie kornmarkt 1 3 und 4 die mieter dort k nnen sich ber wohnungen freuen in denen vom stromkabel bis zum fenster und balkon alles nagelneu ist inklusive der w rmed mmung auf h chstem standard hinzu kommen in einem teil der aufg nge innen bzw au en liegende fahrst hle sowie loggien und in der obersten etage laubengang hnlich aneinander gereihte balkone im kornmarkt 1 sind dar ber hinaus 10 behindertenfreundliche wohnungen mit breiteren t ren entstanden die dank des lifts auch ebenerdig erreichbar sind
1657997 nur haben wir jetzt den vorteil dass nur ein geringer teil der wohnungen bewohnt sind da muss man bei den arbeiten weniger r cksicht nehmen und kommt schneller voran
1657998 so werden 2 wohnungen im erdgeschoss einen eigenen vorgarten bekommen in richtung innenhof weitere besonderheit es entstehen drei vollkommen neue wohnungen durch einen vorbau an der stirnseite der h user in richtung kranichstra e und zwei von diesen wohnungen wiederum im dachgeschoss bekommen eine gro z gige terrasse die mit kies und holzauflagen sthetisch anspruchsvoll gestaltet wird

1658468 well feel free to challenge me all you want just keep in mind im always right
1658469 oh come on these kids are grateful for whatever work i give them they come from a place where astrology is considered a science and toilets a luxury
1658470 we chinese carry the burden of our history with us and the question of western humiliation is always unconsciously inside us
1658471 throughout the ages chinese have had only one way of looking at foreigners
1658472 we either look up to them as gods or down on them as wild animals
1658473 the west is central to the construction of chinas identity today it has become chinas alter ego
1658474 to serve the political ideological rhetorical and or emotional needs of the present
1658475 experienced several decades of economic oppression by the foreign powers
1658476 as a consequence is being transformed everywhere into a colony
1658477 ours will no longer be a nation subject to insult and humiliation we have stood up
1658478 the occupation of hong kong was the epitome of the humiliation that china suffered in modern history
1658479 the chinese people cannot be bullied the chinese race cannot be insulted
1658480 the century of humiliation both reflect and powerfully shape chinas relations with the west today
1658481 by evoking the people events and symbols of chinas early modern encounter with the west chinese continually return to this unresolved trauma
1658482 neither communisms victory over the nationalist party in the civil war nor the declaration of liberation in 1949 appears to have exorcised the past
1658483 the world has a new lever to try and win better behavior from china
1658484 a wolf wrapped in a monks robe a monster with a human face but the heart of a beast
1658485 through their coverage and handling of the beijing torch relay the west seemed to remind the chinese they were still not equal and they were still not good enough

1658489 educar sin amar al hombre que se recibe como educando es como una condena especialmente en los momentos de crisis del proceso educativo

1658496 para tener una idea del colegio basta con mirar al equipo docente si tiene un proyecto de vida la instituci n toda lo tiene si el docente pierde claridad y valor ese no ser un buen colegio claridad en el tratamiento de contenidos valor en cuanto a la p rdida de confianza
1658497 no se puede educar sin asumir la conciencia clara de los roles s lo as se lo puede dejar adecuadamente libre al educando sin caer en la permisividad de compinches o demagogos
1658498 no se puede educar sin la conciencia de las diferencias con el educando s lo as se lo puede comprender y acompa ar porque su etapa ya ha sido vivida y elaborada por el educador

1658503 educar es desarrollar la capacidad de percepci n de la realidad de juicio cr tico coherente y de donaci n generosa para intentar un mundo mejor
1658504 la verdadera educaci n religiosa es generadora del m s hondo y radical dinamismo porque junto con la expectativa de ser el futuro muestra el modelo hacia el que marchamos y fortalece la vida de la fe y de la esperanza
1658505 los ni os y adolescentes no se malogran porque se los frustre en determinadas ocasiones sino porque no se los frustre nunca y lleguen a ser as v ctimas de sus caprichos o porque se los frustre permanentemente y lleguen a ser incapaces de conocer la alegr a de la libertad o porque se los frustre sin amor suficiente cuando es necesario poner l mites y marcar rumbos
1658506 una falta puede ser la ocasi n del encuentro personal con el educando siempre que no la miremos como una simple violaci n del orden sino como una manifestaci n de su inmadurez o de una necesidad que no ha sido atendida lo m s importante no es el orden sino que ese ser humano descubra un camino y experimente la buena voluntad de seguirlo

1658509 dios sabe que yo no fui el que rob ese dinero
1658510 es muy provechoso tener paciencia y saber callar y dejar a dios que tome nuestra defensa
1658511 me di cuenta de que yo ten a un temperamento bilioso y amargo y me convenc de que con un modo de ser spero y duro se hace m s mal que bien en el trabajo de las almas y entonces me propuse pedir a dios que me cambiara mi modo agrio de comportarme en un modo amable y bondadoso y me propuse trabajar d a tras d a por transformar mi car cter spero en un modo de ser agradable
1658512 oh dios m o si el padre vicente de pa l es tan amable c mo lo ser s t
1658513 tres veces habl cuando estaba de mal genio y con ira y las tres veces dije barbaridades
1658514 y esas joyas que lleva en los dedos y en el cuello y en las orejas
1658515 yo soy un pobre pastorcito de ovejas que dej el campo para venirme a la ciudad pero sigo siendo siempre un campesino simpl n y ordinario

1658547 should exist or if and how it should be regulated or controlled similarly lets develop a shared understanding of the high level approaches consumers could take with data before we discuss what approach each of us thinks they should take with data
1658548 course i am boy you see anyone else around here glowin
1658549 smart boy keep this up and ill be sharin my secrets with you yet
1658550 most folk dont like bein near as you an see but you arent most folk are you
1658551 the scars are barely even healed seems they mean you focused on illusions at the college right
1658552 boy you learn a lot of things in my line of work specially with my caravan
1658553 bring me a plate of bread and cheese and keep my companions tankard as full as he wants it
1658554 his companion wants it as full as you can keep it
1658555 yeah nice hex there i see you let the waitress in though they teach you kids good these days i can recognize em but i cant draw em like that
1658556 its a caravan guess youre not as bright as i thought
1658557 oh why didnt you say anythin in particular you want to know
1658558 nobody knows that not even someone like myself that truths lost
1658559 no i was once a mortal like you well not xactly like you i was to be a barber
1658560 and it was given to you by the previous caravan master
1658561 yeah rumors well theyre mostly true so here you are askin the questions to see what you could be getting into eh
1658562 thats the thing i thought id miss the most but i dont really
1658563 oh i can just few enough of em want to get near they fear the taint as some call it
1658564 yeah they think its some forsaken disease they can catch except for a few who find it appealing they tend to be the real bizarre ones though
1658565 oh all over really one of em says it was an ancient death cult that caused them to be here people wantin to cross the void but wanting to come back well they come back to serve the caravan
1658566 oh sure not that i really like it i thought itd be fun at first
1658567 oh sure the problems most of em aint the savory type if you know my meanin
1658568 i think perhaps they were turned away from both the pale and the jet gates and they have to work off their sins
1658569 but you do not consider yourself a sinner like they are
1658570 but i lived clean even now i dont use the caravan to terrorize people as the stories say some of the old masters did
1658571 the caravan goes where it wants it needs to be at certain places at certain times to collect some of the souls and leave others i can divert it slightly as long as it gets to where it needs to go in time
1658572 but i just make good decisions buy up cheap goods or buy up goods i know will be in demand soon after 20 years ive learned prices for goods and can spot a bargain
1658573 i studied illusion but i wanted to study another art
1658574 the caravan is my best chance to study those between life and death without being branded a traitor for disobeying the king
1658575 i guess i can see that i can tell youre an adept of no mean power so it makes sense
1658576 i will make no judgment about your motives and i wont say anything to anyone else no sense getting myself into trouble and i know you wont be able to get into trouble either
1658577 simple boy just take this ring from me and wear it
1658578 youre damn near immortal when youre near the caravan and eventually you can pass the ring off to someone else when you get tired
1658579 well sure its not a bad life bein a caravan master normally and theres other benefits as well for masterin this one but this isnt the life to lead if you want to find a woman and settle down you know
1658580 put it on before you break the enchantment on the caravan they know whats goin on
1658581 seems to be part of the enchantment but it didnt happen too many other times while i was caravan master
1658582 im off to find myself a little company for whats left of the night good trading
1658583 you owe it to the caravan master that is now me
1658584 you heard the other man he said i could have what he was owed
1658585 one silver coin per crate or two coppers per mat sir
1658586 ill give you a gold coin for all your crates here
1658587 ill have a hauler come by within the hour to collect the crates

1658633 for those of you who cling to scientific method this is pretty bizarre stuff but she and many others are dead serious about it if a research finding could harm a class of persons the theory of post modernism is that scientists should change the way they talk about that finding since is a way of building a body of knowledge based on skeptical testing replication and publication this is a problem the tight framework of scientific method mandates figuring out what would disprove the theory being tested and then looking for the disproof the thought process that spawned the scientific revolution was inherently skeptical which is why disciples of scientific method say that no theory can be definitively and absolutely proved but only disproved falsified hypotheses are elevated to the status of theories largely as a result of continued failures to disprove the theory and continued conformity of experimentation and observation with the theory and such efforts should be conducted by diverse parties needless to say post modernist schools of thought and scientific method are almost polar opposites

1658782 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1658783 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1658784 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1658785 they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee
1658786 i understand that about 200 of our athletes received those masks through the national governing body not directly from the u s olympic committee

1658837 we were talking about this in the office just the other day
1658838 one of my colleagues is in her late 20s and she says that her friends of the same age are obsessed with the jonas brothers maybe its just a way to relive their youths to remember what it felt like when they were in high school and had a crush on the members of a boy band i grew up in the 80s and i loved duran duran when the original five members reunited a few years ago i was thrilled
1658839 i dont think the songs will be among the hundred greatest songs of the 21st century but its not total fluff its more than just disposable pop
1658840 you definitely need talent too the jonas brothers are sincere about their musical tastes they clearly have their own opinions and history their own aesthetic
1658841 i have a son who is older than both nick and joe grown women can get away with being fans of boy bands if a man my age went to a hannah montana concert people would think he was a pervert

1658866 we have always found it more equitable and more efficient to provide free notifications of broadcast items and only to charge for transcripts or edits that are actually requested by the client this means that we are always on our toes as we need to keep our clients happy we also find that it avoids the kind of resentment that can arise if a contracted client is not getting the kind of service they feel they should receive
1658867 we digitise the information and cross reference it against any new broadcast articles and immediately notify the client free of charge they then have the option to request the item by email ftp or courier

1658871 and yet he and his surrogates continue to downplay their sacrifices by suggesting at every opportunity that the hard won gains we see in iraq are not due to their efforts and indeed would have materialized in their absence

1658935 if you ask the montagnards they say we just want peace
1658936 we think back to our brothers and sisters still left behind in the jungle
1658937 this guy was put in jail for five years in a camp in dak lak province but the way translators wrote it up here is different all these people were put in jail thats why they escaped to cambodia where many of them remain still today
1658938 we really had nowhere to go we didnt know that the following year the u s would allow laotians who could prove they worked with the american government to immigrate to the united states back in 1974 we could nt conceive of being allowed to go to america our only choice was to stay or flee to thailand
1658939 i couldnt take my eyes off it once inside it was like another world it seemed fitting that such a large and comfortable aircraft should take us to america
1658940 these former u s allies add value economically culturally and socially to our state
1658941 in fact we have been constantly amazed at their ability to gain self sufficiency sooner than most other groups of refugees
1658942 i have the privilege of working with about 50 montagnards every day
1658943 they are such wonderful people hard working polite happy and so very dedicated to what they do
1658944 out of a population of 600 000 montagnards worldwide thats one of the biggest percentages of any ethnic group serving in the u s armed forces according to clark there are 27 montagnards in iraq right now fighting four of them are on their third tour

1658951 i dont think we would have lost that game last season we were a harder team to beat

1658953 im not picking out any individual its as a team collectively
1658954 you need to earn the right to win games and that starts with hard work
1658955 we didnt work anywhere near as hard as we did last year and weve not been pulling our weight in pre season either
1658956 we need to get back to basics and start pulling in the one direction again
1658957 we had a tremendous run last season and it wasnt because we were individually brilliant and had lots of flair
1658958 it was all down to hard work and a wee bit of luck along the way
1658959 the bulk of the team were here last year so theres no excuses the players are to blame not the coaching staff or anybody else
1658960 its the players who have come back with that mindset and its the players who have gone out and lost the tie

1659000 the accelerometer and touchscreen provide very intuitive controls that make it possible to control the game in a very natural way
1659001 weve had gamers of all experiences playing this game and thoroughly enjoying it
1659002 we feel the touch screen and accelerometer connect players more deeply with the game and offer a richer more interactive experience

1659027 as it the e mail opened it was this picture of me kissing maria goodbye in that parking lot in china about two weeks earlier
1659028 and it was instant i knew that that was a picture of a daddy kissing his little girl it wasnt just a guy with a little child that needed a home it was a daddy and a little girl it was just so clear when i saw it
1659029 we knew from the get go that she was a firecracker
1659030 i am distraught it was only yesterday that i found out that it was all over so it hasnt really sunk in yet
1659031 although im bitterly disappointed i think ill look back on my career and feel incredibly fortunate to have played alongside some truly great players
1659032 i won twelve trophies at leicester there was a five year period when we won everything there was to win we were the manchester united of rugby and i count myself very lucky to have been a part of that
1659033 i want to express my thanks to gloucester for all the care and support the club has given me and for the help they have pledged to keep giving me
1659034 leon is a fantastic professional a model for anyone wanting to reach the top in the sport and i thank him for the contribution he made to the squad last season
1659035 there are very few players who have achieved what leon has during his career and we are as disappointed and upset as he is that his career has ended in this fashion

1659043 in addition abuses of migrant construction workers who were pivotal to beijings infrastructure improvements have increased as have evictions of beijing residents whose homes were demolished to make way for that infrastructure
1659044 those abuses reflect both the chinese governments wholesale failure to honor its olympics related human rights promises as well as the negligence of the international olympic committee in ensuring that china fulfills its commitments
1659045 instead the beijing games have prompted a rollback in some of the most basic rights enshrined in chinas constitution and international law
1659046 that the camps were not some sort of incidental problem some accident that the soviet union had made but that they were an integral part of the system had been from the beginning and that millions of people had gone through them
1659047 the gulag archipelago was part of a group of books and solzhenitsyn was one of a group of people coming out of the soviet union in the 1970s who began to change the conversation in the united states about human rights should human rights be a part of international dialogue we tend to forget this now but in the 40s 50s and even the 60s it wasnt it wasnt even considered a fit subject for diplomatic discussions
1659048 in some ways solzhenitsyn because of his fame because of the status of his book because he was expelled from the country the news and publicity around him and his work absolutely added to this impetus to make human rights a more important part of u s foreign policy
1659049 i think it came at a time when illusions with the soviet union were already fragile pre hungarian uprising more people believed pre prague spring more people believed gulag came out at a time when it was really hard to believe in the soviet experiment id say it crystallized what was already the latent disillusionment among the european left with the communist experiment
1659050 part of what led to the end of euro communism and the end of pro soviet left wing parties across europe
1659051 at the time it was published it did have an enormous impact i would say particularly in western europe and above all particularly in france the french left was still very strong and still very pro soviet and the french communist party was still very strong and even more pro soviet
1659052 alexander isaevich outlived his era and never truly accepted the new post soviet epoch
1659053 having sincerely dedicated his life to a desperate struggle against communism in 1991 solzhenitsyn suddenly found himself without a battle to fight
1659054 the austrian minister for culture is charming and actually cares about culture and the austrian prime minister gave me cake while i tried to assure him my own prime minister would have taken my cake and told me it would be given to the destitute and cake needy before sneaking it into the cake trough of a cake spattered man in a mink cake eating suit poor gordon though perhaps soon to be replaced by one or another miliband theyre twins after all what happens if we get the evil twin ive watched more than enough hammer horror films to know this is surely a risk

1659061 a funny wordgame is done in the headlines of the israeli newspaper harretz
1659062 worship matters it matters to god because he is the one ultimately worthy of all worship it matters to us because worshiping god is the reason for which we were created and it matters to every worship leader because we have no greater privilege than leading others to encounter the greatness of god thats why its so important to think carefully about what we do and why we do it
1659063 the greatest challenge is what you yourself bring to the platform each and every sunday your heart
1659064 the better we know god through his word the more genuine our worship will be in fact the moment we veer from what is true about god were engaging in idolatry regardless of what we think or feel there is no authentic worship of god without a right knowledge of god
1659065 mind and heart belong together strong passionate desires for god flow from and encourage the faithful thoughtful study of god his nature character and works
1659066 a faithful worship leader magnifies the greatness of god in jesus christ through the power of the holy spirit by skillfully combining gods word with music thereby motivating the gathered church to proclaim the gospel to cherish gods presence in to live for gods glory
1659067 transcendent and immanent head and heart planned and spontaneous rooted and relevant skilled and authentic
1659068 god has given the pastor not the worship leader the ultimate responsibility for the direction of the church that includes the musical portions of the meeting when we are at odds scripture is clear i am the one who needs to submit
1659069 he died as he lived placing others first and doing what he wanted to do so well without fear or complaint

1659145 this year we saw all the same companies return to exhibit at maats and more the slight attendance decrease can be attributed to the fact that returning companies brought less people to the show
1659146 in fact we had a larger number of buyers attend this years show than last year the 400 total buyers doesnt take into account the buyer cross over we saw from icast which doesnt record those numbers
1659147 the feedback we received from maats exhibitors regarding the shared show floor was overwhelmingly positive
1659148 exhibitors and buyers alike felt the shared space created an increased buzz for both shows and provided each venues participants with new business opportunities
1659149 this large dealer turnout signals great potential for the shows future
1659150 were planning to roll out a full marketing plan to attract even more dealers to maats in 2009

1659211 all we want is for hsbc to facilitate the delivery of our presents
1659212 we believe this would be easily achieve and could actually be cheaper than organising refunds the deliveries could be organised at cost price and would be a huge publicity coup for them it could save them money as well
1659213 i will not be joining the march no way wrapit is wholly responsible for getting themselves in this mess why should they expect hsbc to bail them out
1659214 the company directors have made several statements and suggestions for a resolution for outstanding orders none of which hsbc considers appropriate or practical
1659215 hsbcs view is that this should never have happened and had the directors acted sooner to address their financial difficulties and appointed administrators when hsbc recommended it may not have
1659216 hsbc fully appreciates how wrapits customers feel about this issue and understands their distress and concern that a resolution be found quickly
1659217 hsbc again refutes any suggestion that hsbc was responsible for the companys failure hsbc believes it has done all it can over recent months to assist the directors
1659218 iprofile is a software system that significantly enhances the efficiency of our members its a centralised resume database into which our members dump their existing databases into one centralised common xml format
1659219 from the moment our members dump their resumes in it the resumes get formatted and duplicates get removed for an embargoed period only the agency that dumped that resume into the database has access to it
1659220 but after that period whenever the it professional goes in to update his resume he gets the option of choosing which of the range of agencies that are partners in the system will have access to that resume
1659221 all the work in maintaining and keeping the resume up to date is done by the candidate so it removes from our members the requirement to maintain these huge databases of resumes because its all done automatically by the candidates

1659258 the twelve tribes is up there with a textbook cult
1659259 they can dismiss me as a disgruntled former member but ive seen what goes on
1659260 if you dont tow the line you get cut off from your family
1659261 i have all three kids now because i demanded that when i left but their mother hasnt spoken to them for six years
1659262 you are not paid wages super or any workers compensation you work long hours six days per week sometimes doing dangerous work youre not qualified to do
1659263 they dont want to expose children to anything outside of the cult they dont get taught critical analysis and are disciplined for using their imagination
1659264 their child discipline manual is not handed out anymore but they still tell you how to follow it
1659265 the manual says stripes or marks from disciplining shows love the stripes are from hitting with a bamboo stick that leaves welts
1659266 i was hearing negative things about the twelve tribes around town and the only way to find out about it was to spend time there
1659267 im mightily impressed i intend to stay and im very open to the idea of joining
1659268 the kids here are happy and well adjusted i feel so at home and cared for
1659269 speaking for myself it is an incredibly worthwhile life and cause
1659270 as a high school teacher for 15 years and a widely travelled cultural explorer i am yet to see a better example than the twelve tribes community anywhere in the world
1659271 at agiles core is a process that seeks more predictable delivery schedules higher quality products and greater user satisfaction we made the decision that to be a more agile business we needed to run a more agile software delivery organization
1659272 the biggest fear in going agile is that you will lose control but the reality is that you never really had control in the first place project managers build schedules but there is really no connection between these dates and windows and what is going on underneath no visibility into the actual work schedules become a reporting tool not what is driving the delivery process agile can change that
1659273 the reality is that as i lead our agile transition
1659274 i have to evaluate it from the perspective of the business how is agile working for us i have to be able to look at both worlds and understand where the application of agile will achieve the best results ultimately i could care less what methodology we are using as long as we are able to deliver predictable high quality results to manage that i need intelligence teamanalytics lets me see whats working and what isnt identify trends surface areas that need more attention and make informed decisions
1659275 the data is what helped me to understand the key benefits that agile brings to teams so that i can identify the projects that make the most sense to transition
1659276 when i joined the company i found a product organization that was overly distributed top heavy and at a cost and investment structure that was not in line with the strategic objectives of the company
1659277 in addition the teams were struggling to consistently meet delivery goals
1659278 our teams run their standup meetings with the teamfocus team board projected on the wall and available to any distributed team members
1659279 they can immediately enter it into the system that they use throughout the day keeping the team and the entire organization up to date on the project from there the teams go away and execute that is the beauty of the approach
1659280 no longer are dev cycles measured in 12 24 month cycles
1659281 this drives a different behavior in both requirements definition and the npi new product introduction processes to meet this change in frequency
1659282 we are also moving our headquarters to a new office and the entire design is oriented to support the needs of the agile team
1659283 we have had such great success with agile that we wanted to create a cutting edge environment that promotes the principles of agile throughout the organization
1659284 weve created one of the closest most successful vendor customer partnerships ive ever seen and weve deepened our relationships with many of our strategic customers who have participated in more than 50 sprint reviews
1659285 and id say weve eliminated six days a month of vp and director time per product group previously spent reporting
1659286 the tool is designed to support the way agile teams work empowering them to be more effective at their jobs while automatically giving management visibility into progress
1659287 today borlands agile teams use teamfocus to manage their daily stand ups and sprint reviews
1659288 i think theres not an insignificant chance of an interest rate rise primarily because the quarterly inflation report is out this month and one member of the mpc has said that it is a good time to explain a rate rise
1659289 with inflation rising a hike this month could be one last signal from the bank of its commitment to bring inflation down while i predict a no change tomorrow a move in rates is not inconceivable if they are to move its more likely to go up than down
1659290 the outlook for growth continues to deteriorate with recession looking increasingly unavoidable
1659291 the mpc have been caught between rising inflation and slowing growth and the battle between the two has been getting more intense over the past few months now its going to be the worst its ever been

1659298 this is an entirely peaceful event the very suggestion that wed have weapons stashes isnt just ridiculous its offensive
1659299 this is a smear tactic pure and simple were here to run workshops and debates demonstrate sustainable living and take peaceful action against climate change
1659300 the only weapons weve seen near the site were the batons and pepper spray the police were using against unarmed campers yesterday
1659301 i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs that we are using on patrol
1659302 and if you look at the equipment we have seized it is clear to me the plan was to use these items for criminal purposes
1659303 i have to say again that kent police is committed to policing lawful protest and we do recognise that most of the people attending are responsible and law abiding
1659304 but we have said both to the public and climate camp representatives that our officers will not hesitate to enforce the law where necessary
1659305 over the next few weeks im gonna have to call in some favours from a few of my friends from the industry i cant tell you who just yet because its gonna be a surprise for the kids
1659306 but were gonna have to put this production on of hairspray in the west end and weve got just six weeks to do it so fingers crossed
1659307 weve picked the best school for this theyre really good we have got a long way to go but you really must watch the show because this is such a big challenge for me its something that ive been wanting to do for a very long time
1659308 we wont just experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century it will be more like 20 000 years forward thinkers believe by 2050 explosive information growth created by the singularity could thrust our world into what astronomer
1659309 we heard it on the radio this morning tuesday and it was the first wed heard of it
1659310 were still in talks with the gardai and authorities to see if its a possibility and to try and sort things out but eveyone involved is hopeful it will go ahead
1659311 its really a great shame that for various reasons there wasnt enough interest to make the festival at dysart successful this year
1659312 were hoping that the scaled down event in town will be a success for all concerned
1659313 were really sorry to all the people who showed their support and booked tickets in advance but barring any other hiccups well have a small and cosy but great day of music in town
1659314 for the very first time im able to create superheroes in the fantastic japanese manga style thanks to my lucky partnership with the great hiroyuki takei what a kick itll be to join hiroyuki san in offering brand new action packed stories to an army of readers in both the eastern and western worlds
1659315 word of ultimos development and subsequent debut in japan led many domestic fans to wonder when they would get a chance to read it so were very excited to offer the north american debut in the upcoming september issue of shonen jump
1659316 ultimo was developed as a true collaboration with stan lee sending his initial story idea to takei san who developed artwork and characters and reworked the plot to fit into the japanese manga storytelling style the result is something extremely compelling and we invite everyone to check out this historic release in our upcoming issue

1659320 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1659321 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1659322 the epic itself is basically about one man you pass through a lot of things but you never get to look at it with clone wars were not burdened by the mythological underpinnings we get to go more places
1659323 the story about anakin skywalker and his fall into the dark side and redemption by his son thats finished it was started when he was 10 it ends when he died theres no more story to tell all that stuff is really not part of what this is
1659324 when i was a kid imagining that there were other jedi knights beyond yoda was incredible weve never really seen those other characters fully developed and thats one thing we can really get into in this movie and in this series
1659325 also there are a lot of the clones that we can get involved with on the front lines and see just how they all contributed to this great republic that we always heard about in star wars and how it falls apart and becomes an empire
1659326 i try to stay very closely tied to the live action films as far as i dont want to interrupt the continuity that george created
1659327 but once we kind of moved away from one on one end and until we get towards revenge of the sith on the other theres a lot of room to explore
1659328 nosotros aspiramos a la normalizaci n urgente del indec cuanto antes esto se pueda lograr ir en beneficio de todos seguimos teniendo la esperanza de que esto se haga

1659330 tenemos que sacar los indec que corresponden no podemos estar mencionando un indec que no pertenece a lo que nosotros producimos o compramos
1659331 tenemos que ponernos al habla en torno a los movimientos de los precios y lo que pasa en el indec porque si no vamos a perder mucho m s en el futuro

1659333 i think that the challenge is tough but i always put up a good fight and if i dont win thats ok im new at this game i might win in the future
1659334 to come behind a 1 record and have a person whos currently relevant in dream one of the better songwriters to come through this industry and then do the jamie foxx thing the boss of all bosses i wanted to try something differently than i did on my last album j holiday
1659335 i wanted to load up two big features on that record as well try something different a lot of times you get a feature and its just you and that other artist i wanted to see if i could bring something different to the game see if i can force people to follow my trend
1659336 rage is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band and from my perspective has undermined our artistic and political ideal
1659337 i feel theres a lot of life to the tracks and a real solid groove things feel tight
1659338 its a lot of fun the material is very dynamic and we cant wait to present it to the world its been a great journey
1659339 connecting with them onstage was the first phase of the journey and then being able to create with them has been a great experience
1659340 it was the best school of song arranging in metal and rock you can ever imagine it was a wonderful experience theres nothing like it
1659341 in the studio and no offense towards jason but rob has already contributed more to this record than jason did in 14 years
1659342 its difficult to praise rob without insinuating that there was something not great about his predecessor and ive got nothing but respect and love for jason but rob hes been with us five years now and its completely effortless its never felt this complete
1659343 sometimes i look over at him and hes playing his bass onstage and it feels like hes always been there his chemistry his personality it just all fits in really really well
1659344 a lot of it did have to do with our fear of losing some kind of control no doubt about that
1659345 but rob has slipped in somehow easier he has this respect about him we didnt have to haze the fan out of him or toughen him up somehow
1659346 he is very gifted very fast and he kind of just fits in hes such a gifted musician and rob spent a lot of time being the third wheel in the lars james songwriting process and he just adapted to it super quickly and was great to bounce ideas off of and to come up with a great suggestion when me or james would get stuck he was right in there with us its been incredibly positive to have him around in the creative process the way we all connect with each other and the way we connect with our fans
1659347 the good will and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country at the olympic games

1659354 i am very protective i love them very very much
1659355 i truthfully dont know where their sense of humor lies these days
1659356 i thought some of the roast was a little over the top
1659357 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1659358 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1659359 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1659360 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1659361 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1659362 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets
1659363 now growth of housing prices has started lowering but only by a small margin
1659364 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1659365 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1659366 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1659367 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1659368 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1659369 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow

1659374 it is striking the difference of perspective between the united states and many other countries
1659375 i think because of the politics around immigration more broadly the fact that mr medellin is mexican rather than swedish does make a difference
1659376 it certainly does play into a bigger debate and bigger fears that many people have about immigration from mexico

1659380 several paparazzi began fighting and one pulled a knife on the other one
1659381 the unsealed documents should answer the outstanding questions regarding the findings in this case
1659382 what troubles me is that mr ivins wasnt indicted and if he wasnt indicted how confidant are they that they had the evidence and the information that they needed
1659383 the only thing that has changed is that he has committed suicide
1659384 i think its important to give all of us victims and the american people information that they can share and some appreciation of the overall state of the investigation
1659385 but i also think its important given the mistakes made in the past that they are not jumping to premature conclusions
1659386 all of us dont think he had anything to do with it
1659387 i just have to see what theyve got you work mostly with scientists and they say show me the data you look at what youve got make a decision and then act on it

1659510 people say that there are holes in the system and that kids fall through but i know better than they do that thats the truth kids in foster care have so many more challenges
1659511 but because kids can remain in care until 21 theres certainly a gap in the after services provided

1659587 we are not born to be killed by muslim terrorists
1659588 i would tell the hindus to face death cheerfully if the muslims are out to kill them i would be a real sinner if after being stabbed i wished in my last moment that my son should seek revenge i must die without rancour you may turn round and ask whether all hindus and all sikhs should die yes i would say such martyrdom will not be in vain

1659598 each death only makes us more determined we are not going to be bullied by the valley any more jammu wants a voice of its own jammus hindus will no longer tolerate oppression by kashmirs muslims
1659599 mr vohra did neither he only added fuel to the fire by telling some people who went to plead with him why should i bother about jammu does jammu matter does jammu exist he has been insensitive and his actions have only served to provoke the protesters
1659600 years of neglect of jammu by kashmir has resulted in what you are seeing today the people are frustrated the pandits have at last found a platform to vent their anger jammu has more people than kashmir but the lions share always goes to the valley
1659601 clearly underestimated the determination of jammus long suffering hindus who have had to cope with denial and deprivation for decades as the state government focuses only on the kashmir valley

1659658 we are better off with this inflation targeting framework lets stick with it for now
1659659 it doesnt help if there is a huge budget deficit or unsustainable increases in municipal rates and tariffs or electricity tariffs or public health or education costs
1659660 i dont blame people for complaining that monetary policy is tighter but lets not confuse that with abandoning the inflation targeting framework
1659661 there is every possibility that the gang caught re packaging adulterated cement in trucks to various sites at night in lagos are people that know a lot about cement the bags they use belong to a known cement manufacturer in the nation so ruling out the possibility that it is not an in house operation is not there
1659662 the cement manufacturers in our midst as well as major construction companies are all suspects in this act as the bulk cement that are being adulterated and re bagged emanates from your companies the bags being used belong to you and the trucks carrying them are yours
1659663 it has thus become necessary for you to co operate with us to get to the root of these unpatriotic acts by doing a thorough soul searching and investigating to nip it in the bud the people caught on site were handed over to the police and have been charged to court
1659664 once durable price stability is achieved sound growth of the economy would take care of itself of course this is easier said than done but it can be done provided all the policy ingredients are present
1659665 the monetary policy makers at the bank should know and should let the public know on which leg it is and will be dancing the public in a democracy has the rightto know which policy objective the bank is after
1659666 transparency and full disclosure which will engender a healthy competition as well as create a convergence among the banks we believe this policy will have a positive effect on the interest rate regime
1659667 at the end of each month we will publish the rate of each bank and for which sector we will take it seriously as each md is expected to sign what each bank sends to us
1659668 we are not prescribing what they banks will charge but we are saying make full disclosure of what is being charged
1659669 to belong to digital environment it will take nigeria about 50 years how companies in nigeria have digitalized their data what is happening to our national database how can nigeria grow when there are over 10 million house boys wasting their knowledge in the name of slavery our best brains are wasting in the commercial never centres across the nation selling pure water when the software in their brains are untapped how are you going to count the colossal loss the child yet unborn may not forgive any government that fails to secure its digital future
1659670 we may not achieve this with the level of poor development strategies in relation to it infrastructures
1659671 ict is now accepted not only as the common currency but indeed it represents the centre of gravity of the new world and new economy of the universe as we migrate deeper into the unknown tunnel of the digital revolution no nation will be capable of achieving the objectives and the critical tasks of the millennium development goals mdgs nor fulfill the targets set for her national development vision and plans unless she tackles and resolves the challenges of cybercrime and ensures that commensurate infrastructure and human resource capacity are built effectively to respond to the emerging monster it is within the dynamics of the available global statistics on cybercrime that the assumption that nigeria faces a monumental challenge with respect on how to respond effectively to the recurring decimal of cybercrime and cyber security
1659672 this is a national imperative otherwise it will spell doom for nigeria struggling to make a mark in the knowledge economy this must be done so as to secure the children yet unborn

1659674 id theft costs banks 1 billion a year adding that in the usa nearly 10 000 victims had home loans totaling about 300 million taken out in their name in 2002 and another 68 000 had new credit cards issued in their name
1659675 while the ftc received 161 000 identity theft complaints last year the fbi estimates that the actual number of victims is probably closer to 500 000
1659676 at no time did i seize the cards that are meant for the people what will i be doing with them all i did was to provide security and safety for inec officials who were distributing the cards when they came under threat and had to discontinue with the distribution of the cards
1659677 gen kpamber rtd seized voters cards of the people in our area and the sole reason is that the people do not belong to his own political party the pdp
1659678 the vice president has frowned at organisations using his name to solicit for funds and assistance since this can be abused as past evidence shows
1659679 for this reason he vice president has firmly discouraged the use of his name for bodies forum associations and other such organisation this forum can be no exception
1659680 the attention of the office of the vice president has been drawn to the activities of a body called dr goodluck jonathan forum for global peace
1659681 his visit is very important because sickle cell is a disease by a conservative estimate over four million nigerians have sickle cell disease while another 25 million are carriers it is estimated that more than 100 000 children are born with sickle cell disease in the country each year also important is the fact that the disease is more predominant among black people than other races that is why we think that nigeria as the largest black nation on earth should be able to spear head efforts aimed at finding permanent solution to the problem of this disease in africa
1659682 there are a few nigerians who received training on bone marrow disease he can help us sharpen those ones he can also help us set up a standard state of the art facility in the country where this procedure can be carried out so that parents who can afford can access treatment for their children who have the disease
1659683 in 1998 dr allan wayne carried out bone marrow transplantation on a nigerian child chuka esiobu who then had the sickle cell disease he obtained healthy sample from the sibling of the patient with whom he had a 6 6 hla typing perfect match

1659700 all radars of the nigeria air force are grounded without any plan to resuscitate them while most of their barracks are in dire need of water supply scheme to cater for the needs of the solders
1659701 if sincere attention is being paid to the security and protection of the nigeria nation the situation of comatose in the air force would have become a thing of the past
1659702 the inspection panel has clearly laid out the reckless manner in which wapco disrupted the lives and livelihoods of villagers in nigeria
1659703 we take satisfaction in the fact that the panel validated our claims and that the banks management accepted responsibility for allowing wapco to trample peoples rights but we still dont have an explanation on why such grievous violations of world bank policy were allowed to occur
1659704 the world bank should explain why it failed to effectively present the case for land for land compensation that bank policy calls for and should prove its claim that now after the mistakes are acknowledged there is no more land available for the displaced people even after reading the banks version of events it is hard to believe the bank did not collude with wapco to slash the already very conservative valuation of the villagers property
1659705 lets remember that wapco is not a struggling local enterprise but a consortium of some of the worlds richest companies including chevron and shell it is stunning to see them and the world bank deny impoverished people their due
1659706 the world bank quoted us the prices we should be paid and then reneged without consulting us they have sown confusion and despair in my community now that they are admitting mistakes they must publicly disclose how they decided on their valuations of our trees crops and lands
1659707 hope that china would bring its influence on sudan to bear on the peace process has been misplaced with investments reportedly worth over three billion u s dollars in sudan china which is also khartoums biggest arms supplier has consistently backed al bashir
1659708 the party took the decision to revert to the letters of the 2001 constitution of the party which gives every member of the party the right to aspire to the post of the partys bot we also resolved that the amendments to be made to the constitution were those recommended by the reconciliation committee report as reviewed by the dr bello haliru mohammeds review committee which are aimed at satisfying the yearnings of the greater majority of our members

1659710 a summit of the founding fathers of the party has been summoned for the last quarter of 2008 to deliberate on how best the party can revert to the original values and principles on which the party was founded nec believes this would form the bedrock for reconciliation and internal democracy
1659711 the party henceforth commits itself strictly to its electoral guidelines and constitutional provisions in issues of nomination the era of arbitrariness in the nomination process is over
1659712 nec also resolved to propose an amendment to the provisions of the partys constitution that deals with the leadership membership and functions of the board of trustees
1659713 nec accepted the recommendation that the board of trustees should revert to its advisory role as contained in the pdp constitution 2001 as amended
1659714 nec also resolved on the reconstitution of the board of trustees in line with the proposed amendments a special national convention of the party shall hold in the first quarter of 2009 to consider these constitutional amendment proposals
1659715 this think tank shall work with the pdi and relevant agencies of government
1659716 nec also proposed an amendment to the pdp 2006 constitution to include the power of each state caucus to co opt elders into its membership this will address some of the complaints of sidelining by members of the party all nominations for appointments must come from the recommendations of state caucuses

1659833 obama voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by president bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production a measure for which vice president dick cheney played a major role mccain opposed the bill saying at the time that it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry
1659834 while americans are hurting barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today

1659845 at a time of severe stress in the housing and credit markets we are successfully providing critical liquidity and stability
1659846 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate we are confident the actions we are taking are strengthening freddie macs financial and competitive position as well as its ability to serve the american homebuyer and will generate value well into the future
1659847 during the second quarter freddie mac continued to perform its mission manage risk and add long term value through expanded business opportunities

1659869 the president and i agree on most issues there was a recent study that showed that i voted with the president over 90 of the time
1659870 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i don
1659871 but whos really out of touch the bush administration estimates that expanded offshore drilling could increase oil production by 200 000 bbl per day by 2030 we use about 20 million bbl per day so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now meanwhile efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 and regular maintenance can add another 4 many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
1659872 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens

1659895 i want to persuade the brother and sister to join us for a meal
1659896 why do we need to have anything to do with them they are too closely allied to dare and degar for my liking
1659897 it is my job to keep you safe and i cant do that if you keep talking to people your father will have me hung up for the crows to feed on if i fail in my mission
1659898 i need to talk to them exactly because it is unclear where their loyalties lie brila marlin has many powerful allies in slarn and it is extremely unusual for two of her children to travel so far from home unaccompanied
1659899 it is possible they have been tasked with agreeing a deal with someone if that is so i need to know both who and what that deal might be
1659900 should we not be talking to tonas mallow and the denger brothers instead they are the ones with the swords we want after all
1659901 and do we have the money to pay for them
1659902 exactly and neither does gally sorn for that matter if we even look at those men she will become suspicious of us and i thought that you wanted to keep me safe gally and i both plan to steal the swords from these traders the only question is which of our plans will succeed do not believe for a moment that we will be the only players involved in this matter either
1659903 i am dor and these are my two companions jant and mal
1659904 it is the least we can do for a shipwrecked sailor though i suspect you and your lady were more passengers than crew on that particular ship
1659905 it is a dangerous journey to travel upriver by sail though i must say that most ships do make it safely to slarn
1659906 as would we had we not been cursed by bad luck
1659907 whatever happened to maroon the two of you on a damaged and sinking ship
1659908 the anchor chain snapped while we were moored only a quarter mile from wegnar our captain did not want to risk entering the harbour in the failing light
1659909 though you could have paid the locals to pull you in
1659910 perhaps we could have but the lady glan chose to remain outside until morning
1659911 surely you had a second anchor that you could have dropped and kept the ship safe until morning
1659912 i am not a sailor and have little understanding of such things in the event we found ourselves drifting down the jalon with only the moons to light our way the captain did a sterling job keeping us in the centre of the river and that worked until we ran aground on that mud bank
1659913 which just happened to be in the centre of the river
1659914 your captain was very skilled indeed just unfamiliar with the vagaries of the river jalon
1659915 lady glan was in the hold checking that the cargo was secure when we grounded on the mud and the ship keeled over some of the cargo shifted and blocked her way out i broke my leg in trying to get down to the hold to help her our crew abandoned ship leaving me onboard when i refused to leave without my lady our rescue yesterday i am sure you saw for yourself
1659916 the only thing puzzling me is why you refer to sila klint as lady glan
1659917 you are mistaken she is the lady glan originally from bagdor
1659918 she is sila klint last and only survivor of the mine owners association of telmar ah now i have it what irony it is for you to be rescued by jalia aldare the woman who some rumours claim killed the other members of the association
1659919 why would you think lady glan is this klint woman you speak of
1659920 because i was introduced to her a few years ago
1659921 i was left on the island of seb while my father went to negotiate directly with yandin selda oh do not panic alin i have no intention of revealing her identity to dare or degar i am also travelling incognito as it happens
1659922 should i need a favour at any time during our voyage to slarn
1659923 i am sure that my lady would be more than happy to oblige as would i
1659924 im afraid we shall have to leave you now as there is much we have to do this morning it has been a real pleasure to talk to you
1659925 now that i am sober i must thank you sincerely for my rescue lady aldare
1659926 i must also thank your young travelling companion for her quick thinking with that rope im afraid we have not yet been introduced
1659927 i do hope that boy who helped you came to no harm
1659928 these rules that sailors set themselves seem so silly to me
1659929 then all is well if there is ever a favour i can do for you jalia aldare please let me know such deeds of heroism should never go unrewarded
1659930 that is a woman we would do well not to underestimate
1659931 daniel has too high an opinion of women with big breasts
1659932 even when her life was in danger sila glan wouldnt let go of her carpetbag and that smacks of gross stupidity to me
1659933 i am certain that sila glan is much more than she appears to be
1659934 have you fully recovered from the crossbow bolt to your breastplate

1659937 im afraid that if i did it would make certain swellings go up rather than down
1659938 ive had enough to eat and have many things to do i will see you all later
1659939 only in the sense that you are rather more upfront than jalia can cope with right now
