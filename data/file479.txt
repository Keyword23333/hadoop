4790000 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4790001 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4790002 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4790003 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

4790005 ik heb het een beetje verkloot bij het speerwerpen bij het inwerpen gooide ik de speer over de 45 meter dan moet je dat in de wedstrijd zeker ook doen
4790006 ik heb veel blessures gehad maar ben steeds teruggekomen nu ben ik een gebroken man
4790007 ik ben wel blij dat het goud en het wereldrecord naar jamaica gaan
4790008 ik had aanvankelijk niet eens in de gaten dat ik een nieuw wereldrecord had gelopen
4790009 ik kwam naar peking om te winnen dat was mijn grote doel en dat is gelukt
4790010 ik focus me nu alleen op de 200 meter ik ben goed voorbereid en ook die ga ik winnen

4790013 georgia es miembro pleno de las naciones unidas organismo que reconoce que osetia y abjasia est n dentro de sus fronteras rusia tiene que demostrar el mismo respeto que tiene la onu

4790019 when it is resolved i mean the underlying conflict it must be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of georgia
4790020 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4790021 about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4790022 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4790023 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4790024 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4790025 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4790026 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4790027 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4790028 for a really satisfying cultural riff however youd have had to take in
4790029 it will consider opening portions of the offshore outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4790030 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4790031 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4790032 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it

4790062 i en vis udstr kning er den nuv rende interesse i sprogpolitikken og kulturen resultatet af venstrefl jens aftr den til akademier og bureaukratier hvor den har v ret ude af stand til at ud ve megen indflydelse over mere traditionelle politiske emner ude af stand til eller uvillig til at deltage i nogen massebaseret bev gelse som kunne transformere den politisk og konomiske samfundsstruktur har venstrefl jen v ret optaget af nye talekoder eller mere krediteret ulovligg relse af diskrimination irrelevansen af disse initiativer for problemer som lav l n arbejdsl shed stigende leveomkostninger og hjeml shed der rammer selve de grupper de er tilt nkt at tjene g r langt i retning af forklaringen af det tilbageslag mod politisk korrekthed selv mellem medlemmer af disse grupper
4790063 de politisk korrekte er mindre interesserede i forretning og konomi end samfundets kultur og ledelsesideer de ved at de aldrig kan vinde den konomiske diskussion i ben debat de har faktisk tabt den markedet har triumferet over plan konomien s de vil overlade konomien til forretningslivet under betingelse af at de kontrollere kulturen samfundets ledende ideer

4790105 the interests of our immortal souls are ever and always in direct opposition to the interest of our bodies the law of god is not the law of the world the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh for these are contrary to one another where the law of the flesh is ease comfort and the indulgence of the passions the law of the spirit is self denial moritfication and suffering if any man will come after me says christ let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me matt 116 25 charity is ever opposed to enmities contentions wraths and quarrels modesty continence chastity are ever opposed to uncleanness luxury as is clearly explained in the epistle of today hence we must serve either god or the world you cannot serve god and mammon says our divine mater in todays gospel for no man can serve two masters whose interests are so diametrically opposed to one another as christians and catholics who have already experienced the ineffable joy of laboring in the vineyard of the lord and who know the value of the promised reward in the kingdom of heaven of serving him whose yoke is sweet and whose burden is light matt 11 30 there can be no possible doubt as to which master we ought to serve with loyalty and affection in our best interests for as st paul says we have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear but have received the spirit of adoptions of sons rom 8 15 and again the wages of sin is death but the grace of god life everlasting in christ jesus our lord rom 6 23 whilst we live in the world however we are surrounded by the dangers of the servitude of corruption because god has placed us here to make use in his service as means of salvation of the very instruments of the slavery of the flesh we are not angels but men and so it becomes necessary for us to become delivered from the slavery of the world and the flesh and to make them our servants rather than our masters composed of a body and soul man must devote his energy to the care of the higher and nobler portion of his nature but he maust also in due order and subordination to it support the necessities of his frail mortal body for we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain even till now says st paul and not only it but ourselves also waiting for the adoption of the sons of god the redemption of our body rom 8 22 23 hence we must be thoroughly loyal in the service of god as soon as any of his enemies are at all inclined to assert their mastery over us or interfere in the slightest degree with his best interest we must exert to the utmost our spirit of loyalty and at any sacrifice and at any coust reduce them to subjection saying with our divine master go behind me satan thou art a scandal unto me because thou savorest not the things that are of god but the things that are of men matt 16 23 that we may be on our guard against the specious pretexts of such dangerous and persevering enemies our holy mother the church today warns us against a very common a very constant and a very insidious method of attack by which our loyalty to our divine mater might be placed in jeopardy and that is the necessity under which we are burdened of providing for the natural wants of the body such as food clothing and shelter for which purpose she quotes in the gospel the words of our divine mater himself on the subject

4790130 dass wir morgen gut in form sein werden egal ob es nass oder trocken ist nat rlich w nsche ich mir wie jeder andere auch dass es trocken sein wird weil die heutigen bedingungen absolut schrecklich waren nach 20 minuten war am nachmittag einfach zu viel wasser auf der strecke und es war unm glich das setup oder die zeiten zu verbessern ich bin daher froh zumindest am anfang einige gute runden hingelegt zu haben
4790131 ich denke dass ich im trockenen wesentlich konkurrenzf higer sein kann
4790132 ich denke dass ich im trockenen wesentlich konkurrenzf higer sein kann weil wir noch ein paar modifikationen in der tasche haben die wir noch probieren k nnen hoffentlich ist es morgen trocken das g be uns die besten chancen wir d rfen die hoffnung nicht aufgeben und m ssen sehen was wir ausrichten k nnen
4790133 wir sind gl cklich weil wir unser ziel erreicht haben n mlich trotz der widrigen bedingungen die erste startreihe zu fahren es war gut von valentino gleich eine schnelle runde zu fahren bevor es noch schlimmer wurde wir erwarten dass es morgen trockener sein wird wir versuchen daher aus unserer ersten startreihe das beste zu machen und einen guten start hinzulegen dann k nnen wir hoffentlich um den sieg mitk mpfen
4790134 ich muss sagen dass die schuld nicht komplett bei mir liegt
4790135 zu beginn des qualifyings war es trockener aber zu dem zeitpunkt stand ich in der garage und habe gemeinsam mit meinem team das bike verbessert ich habe meine chance verpasst und genau zu dem zeitpunkt haben alle anderen ihre schnellsten rundenzeiten gefahren ich habe schon fter so schlechte tage wie heute erlebt aber ich muss sagen dass die schuld nicht komplett bei mir liegt
4790136 ich denke dass es momentan offensichtlich ist dass unsere reifen nicht so arbeiten wie sie es sollten
4790137 ich bin aber ein profi und muss weiter abwarten und genug vertrauen in michelin haben dass sie den richtigen weg nach vorne finden die streckenoberfl che ist sehr gut aber noch haben wir nicht den grip den wir brauchen insofern gilt was auch immer morgen mit dem wetter passiert es wird sehr schwierig werden
4790138 wir hatten schon gestern einige probleme mit dem grip an der vorderachse und haben uns bereits gedacht dass wir im regen nicht in der lage sein werden dieses problem zu beheben leider sind die dinge heute noch schlechter verlaufen und wir konnten sowohl hinten als auch vorne berhaupt keine haftung entwickeln
4790139 ich bin sehr zufrieden und auch sehr optimistisch f r das rennen
4790140 in den freien trainingssitzungen haben wir uns ein ausgezeichnetes setup f r das rennen erarbeitet und sind bereits viel versprechende longruns gefahren ein so gut ausbalanciertes rennauto wie den rs spyder auf dem n rburgring zu fahren macht au erdem gro en spa
4790141 unsere reifentests mitte juli in estoril haben sich ausgezahlt wir sind sehr gut sortiert
4790142 dass jos schneller war als casper sehen wir als einen besonderen ansporn an das rennen wird sicher hart
4790143 bei der distanz von 1 000 kilometern und mit einem feld von 46 fahrzeugen auf diesem kurvenreichen kurs muss man sechs stunden lang voll konzentriert sein und darf sich keine fehler erlauben
4790144 als rennfahrer rgert man sich erstmal dar ber nur noch sechster statt vierter zu sein
4790145 aber im grunde ist das entscheidende dass wir f r das rennen ein sehr gutes auto haben wir haben uns von session zu session gesteigert und f hlen uns insofern gut pr pariert
4790146 uns fehlt nur ein starkes zehntel auf den schnelleren ferrari
4790147 insofern gehen wir optimistisch ins rennen denn die bisherigen l ufe der lms haben gezeigt dass alex und ich ber die distanz zuverl ssig und konstant sind uns fehlt 2008 noch ein sieg und diesen hier beim heimrennen zu holen w re einfach nur sch n

4790176 the belief in personalized spirits and other spiritis that inhere in objects like trees and fires
4790177 on the basis of this observation my first attempt in this study is to deny the right of these forces to stay mystical
4790178 the thing is that theyre both so stupidly beautiful and good looking and attractive that their children are born looking gorgeous its unsettling it creates a storm of attractiveness so potent that it could one day bring down the planet i dont think they should breed those two people

4790186 were using our own money from projects that little warrior films has done including three episodes so far of designing spaces for cables tlc if we can show that we can attract a decent following with say a minimum of 5 000 to 10 000 hits then we can take the project to investors in los angeles and in wichita in january to fund the rest of the series
4790187 while we will be filming all around wichita and will be showcasing some of the distinctive architecture like century ii and exploration place we wont identify wichita specifically as ravens home
4790188 everybody watching will see what wichita looks like but wont know where it is to preserve the mystery

4790192 the discovery of liquid water on mars combined with earlier discoveries of organic substances in a meteorite that came from mars and also of methane in the martian atmosphere all point to the existence of life contemporary life on the red planet
4790193 i am not speaking of fossilized life but contemporary life
4790194 even as early as 1976 when the two nasa space probes viking 1 and viking 2 landed on mars experiments carried out in situ pointed strongly to the existence of active microbial life
4790195 in one experiment nutrient broth was poured onto a sample of martian soil and it frothed up so vigorously exuding carbon dioxide that a positive detection of life might have been inferred
4790196 but when the nasa scientists looked for organic material the detritus of living organisms around the landing site their experiments yielded negative or ambiguous results so nasa cautiously concluded no organics means no life detected
4790197 but 32 years on my friend gil levin who was principal investigator on this project maintains that life on mars was indeed detected in 1976 the experiments of 1976 to detect the dead bodies and decomposition products of bacteria were simply not sensitive enough
4790198 i think there could be political and sociological considerations at work
4790199 firstly if life was already detected then there is no need to spend vast sums of money to continue the search
4790200 secondly there is a lot of scientific interest nowadays in bringing back samples of martian soil to earth at the cost of tens of billions of dollars and there is a lobby that says if microbes exist on mars we should not be doing this it could pose a biohazard
4790201 i dont think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that
4790202 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
4790203 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
4790204 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
4790205 however cloaking may be something that this material could be used for in the future youd have to wrap whatever you wanted to cloak in the material it would just send light around by sending light around the object that is to be cloaked you dont see it
4790206 the creature has always been out there and its out there still
4790207 if you travel the ancient trails even today theres a good chance youll meet him
4790208 theres nothing out there in the forest any educated person today knows this
4790209 we cant live today like we did in the 17th or 18th century our culture has to be dynamic
4790210 within the last 40 years weve jumped 300 400 years
4790211 i think most people today know this is just a story
4790212 it was like the bears or the leopards why would we question it
4790213 i tell people lets not dig too much into it
4790214 look this country is changing so much theres a lot of money here now a lot of business some of these beliefs arent going to survive
4790215 the common belief is that traditionalism dissolves in the solvents of modernity
4790216 we want to attach an economic sense to the culture
4790217 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
4790218 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward
4790219 life is difficult here not like in the towns i want them to get government jobs and live easier lives
4790220 my parents used to talk about it about meeting the huge man in the forest
4790221 much like doctors observing a surgical procedure from the gallery above
4790222 a mistaken observation of its nocturnal training exercises over the area
4790223 to restart gasoline fueled engines altogether this succession of effects appears to correspond at least from the theoretical standpoint to the presence of strong ionization this could account for failures in the electrical system by hindering the proper operation of spark plugs and draining batteries
4790224 i had a convertible that plays a major part in this sighting
4790225 i was northbound on route 19 and i turned onto freedom cryder road back in 1965 it was a very rural area you had farmhouses further down the road toward freedom we turned down this road about ten or twenty five minutes after ten oclock
4790226 that light up there its getting awful close and i dont hear anything
4790227 but i couldnt get the engine started we jumped out of the car ran across the road into a field and hid under a fallen tree by now the object was over the car illuminating the area as dark as it was i could see my car alan said the object reminded him of a teardrop and to me it looked like an upside down ice cream cone
4790228 it was white hot really bright brighter than anything ive ever seen in my life it wobbled and swayed back and forth i wanted to get a better look at it and i stood up to take a better look then i felt this wave of heat hit my face
4790229 another car came down the road in the opposite direction stopped by my car and looked at it and then sped away i dont know if he was a witnessed to what happened but after looking at my car he didnt waste much time getting away from it
4790230 the chrome strip around the windshield was so hot i couldnt even touch it it burned my hand
4790231 alan and i dropped the girls off they said they never wanted to discuss this again and that we shouldnt say anything to anybody since who would believe four teenagers with alcohol on their breaths
4790232 mary said she never wanted to talk about it it didnt happen and if anyone ever said anything she would deny having ever been there
4790233 i got home feeling real warm as though i had a temperature but after checking with the thermometer it was normal i looked at my face in the bathroom mirror and i looked sunburned but it didnt hurt
4790234 says youd better take a look at your car something happened to it
4790235 i was really shocked my car was white the hood and the trunk lid had bubbles all over them the chrome around the windshield was burned to a bluish color
4790236 because he might have thought i was some sort of nut
4790237 he thought it might be a defect in the metal from the factory since the paint wouldnt stay on the car i kept the car for about two more months then i got rid of it i just couldnt stand being in the car
4790238 and also was involved with governmental cover ups lily got married and moved out to the midwest mary i saw about a year ago and we spoke about old times when the sighting came up she repeated that she didnt want to know about it it never happened
4790239 that night in 1965 changed mary lily alan and myself
4790240 our lives would never be the same i have a lot of questions about life on earth as it is as how we know it as how we were raised to know it ive talked to a lot of people whove had encounters with ufos and it has changed their lives and put questions in their minds about life on earth i may never know the answer i dont know
4790241 his cars engine died when the ufo flew over it and all the car doors opened at once
4790242 i held on to the steering wheel with all my might
4790243 i forced my back into the drivers seat and thought i was going to die being taken to god knows where hell i was really scared
4790244 i ran into one of the girls from the incident and after we exchanged our hellos i asked her when we were going to talk about that night
4790245 ever since it happened i havent been able to get it out of my head
4790246 i just dont know what to think of it quite frankly
4790247 i cant say theres definite connection but there are just too many coincidences its beyond eerie
4790248 fixed a bug which allowed hacking the game to allow lan play
4790249 and what are you the happiness governor are you happy coz i remember you never tell your family what youre longing to do i mean this is like another miscommunication we are having here
4790250 hey hey what do you know about my family spending a week with them doesnt make you an expert
4790251 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4790252 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4790253 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza

4790256 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4790257 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4790258 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4790259 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4790260 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4790261 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4790262 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4790263 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4790264 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4790265 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

4790268 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

4790272 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4790273 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4790274 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4790275 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

4790277 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4790278 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4790279 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4790280 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4790281 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4790282 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4790283 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4790284 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4790285 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4790286 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4790287 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4790288 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4790289 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4790290 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4790291 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4790292 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4790293 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4790294 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4790295 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4790296 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4790297 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4790298 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4790299 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

4790303 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte

4790315 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4790316 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4790317 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4790318 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4790319 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4790320 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4790321 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4790322 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4790323 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4790325 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4790326 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4790327 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4790328 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

4790332 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4790333 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4790334 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4790335 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4790336 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4790337 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4790338 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4790339 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4790340 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4790341 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4790342 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4790343 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4790344 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4790345 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4790346 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4790347 police were called to the premises at 7 48pm on thursday august 14 where they found the body lying on the remains of a bonfire in the grounds
4790348 police are treating the death as unexplained at present and are hoping that the results of the post mortem forensic tests and other available evidence will enable them to focus the inquiry in a positive direction
4790349 im here as a politician representing one of the worlds oldest democracies to show support for one of the worlds newest we are absolutely right to stand by a country its democracy and its territorial integrity when it has been violated in this way
4790350 david cameron is right to criticise russia but wrong to promise georgia early nato membership
4790351 it is simply not credible for britain and nato to make confetti commitments to protect every nation with the lives of our servicemen and women
4790352 when david cameron matches his tough talk on expanding nato more quickly with a pledge to double defence spending or introduce military conscription perhaps then we could take him seriously
4790353 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4790354 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4790355 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4790356 ethiopian convoys opened fire into different areas where thousands of displaced people were living they killed everyone on the road
4790357 team wise i think well play with our guys we think can be contributors
4790358 wed like them to play well again and maybe for a longer amount of time but were still evaluating players and want to see if they can fit in and help us
4790359 i came here just to win that was my aim
4790360 i didnt even know id won the record till i did my victory lap
4790361 i am just focusing on the 200 metres now i came here prepared and im going to do it
4790362 he is the best ever sprinter and ive said that before
4790363 he has run 9 69 and got the gold so he is definitely the greatest it was a spectacular performance and he was definitely the best here
4790364 he could have run faster if he had run straight through the line
4790365 my legs died on me he was definitely untouchable tonight usain is spectacular im very happy for him
4790366 i really wanted to get that gold medal but its just obvious i wasnt ready for it yet
4790367 i just feel it its certainly going to take something special to win it
4790368 it will be just as competitive as the boys one of the best 100 metres ever
4790369 ethiopian convoys opened fire into different areas where thousands of displaced people were living they killed everyone on the road
4790370 he is coached by victor chegin in russia and chegin is like the trevor graham of usa track and field
4790371 he had three athletes go positive and they all train together in the same squad so it makes you think it is just suspicious
4790372 and today borchin was amazing he beat me by 40 seconds in the last five kilometres and i thought i was going fast
4790373 its a disgrace the sport is not clean their coach chegin is still here and they the ioc should look at banning him
4790374 we all knew we needed this game and we get down 4 0
4790375 we got a little fire in our belly and the coaches got after us after the first couple innings because we werent having good at bats
4790376 the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do things when people say its impossible to tie or break these records i proved anythings possible he said
4790377 if you put in the hard work and put your mind to it anythings possible
4790378 the designs are a carefree way of dressing and arent frayed afterthoughts pulled from the back of a vw bus theres luxury running through these pieces with plenty of riotous silks chiffon and lots of golden accents
4790379 you are not responsible for luck but you are for life
4790380 evidentemente se trata de deporte pero tambi n aprovecharemos la ocasi n para demostrar a qu punto londres es una capital creativa
4790381 podemos aportar una dosis masiva de creatividad y de esp ritu
4790382 son los mejores de los mejores para organizar conciertos pop y dirigir los espect culos del west end
4790383 vieron la ceremonia de pek n y pensaron que fue muy buena pero nosotros tambi n podemos hacerlo igual de bien en un contexto diferente
4790384 pero mi opini n es que no se ver otros juegos como stos
4790385 no puedes construir el vel dromo aqu el terreno me pertenece
4790386 ser a un avance que el palestinismo se conciba a s mismo como movimiento separatista y deje atr s la idea integracionista
4790387 without a doubt im going to feel odd playing against america
4790388 one of the reasons that i no longer wanted to play in mexico was so that i wouldnt have to face them in saying that im now with fc dallas and were playing them in a friendly and we hope that its a fun event for the public instead of a strong rivalry it will be good to see many teammates and friends that i left there and well try to make it a good game so that fans enjoy it and leave happy
4790389 i came here just to win that was my aim
4790390 i didnt even know id won the record till i did my victory lap
4790391 i came here prepared and im going to do it
4790392 my legs died on me usain ran an awesome race im very happy for him
4790393 he can be called the best olympian of all time
4790394 not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and in the way hes actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure
4790395 sin obviar la responsabilidad que puedan tener los servicios sanitarios hay que trabajar que para no se den estos casos ni desde el punto de vista ciudadano ni desde el punto de vista m dico y esta es la l nea en la que estamos trabajando

4790401 how much should my legs hurt after a long run
4790402 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its really probably going to set in my family is here everyone at home is supporting me and i just feel i let them down a little bit
4790403 no i dont know whats going on in georgia either
4790404 and goes on from there with some usefully informative updates and cogent assessments have a look
4790405 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
4790406 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4790407 from the initial checkup i say that none of the babies have any sort of deformities or incomplete organs
4790408 we thought about an abortion but then we felt its religiously forbidden
4790409 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4790410 from the initial checkup i say that none of the babies have any sort of deformities or incomplete organs
4790411 we thought about an abortion but then we felt its religiously forbidden
4790412 it appears from the consistency of mccains numbers in the polling data that he has shored up the republican base or perhaps that the base has spent the spring and summer taking the measure of barack obama and has decided it must unite against him
4790413 the court has some very genuine concerns about the nature and efficacy of these claims
4790414 me or anyone who is a homosexual to endure verbal abuse discrimination episodes of hate and physical violence including murder
4790415 three years and a couple months ago when i got drafted that was my goal
4790416 you dont want to settle for anything less than that and its definitely good to get the opportunity to go out there and be that guy
4790417 i was pretty comfortable last time i just wasnt swinging the bat that well
4790418 hopefully i can continue some of the success i had down there at this level
4790419 were a little more versatile in what we can do because cody can play anywhere
4790420 i wouldnt hesitate to put him in the outfield he can play any infield position he swung the bat pretty decent down in triple a over 20 home runs so cody provides a lot of versatility
4790421 how can the polls be neck and neck when i dont know one bush supporter
4790422 the big sort why the clustering of like minded america is tearing us apart
4790423 bumper stickers or yoga classes and organic fruit shops perhaps unconsciously they are drawn to places where they expect to fit in
4790424 hearing our own thoughts about whats right and wrong bounced back to us by the television shows we watch the newspapers and books we read the blogs we visit online the sermons we hear and the neighbourhoods we live in
4790425 balkanised communities whose inhabitants find other americans to be culturally incomprehensible
4790426 dont take life too seriously youll never make it out alive
4790427 eurovision would be an excellent way to make this theme known we must seriously think of this

4790433 everybody has a right to pronounce foreign names as he chooses
4790434 no proof to show that he wanted to gratify his sexual desire or humiliate the victim
4790435 as educated women we are more aware of our rights and willing to exercise them
4790436 financial independence gives us more confidence to take on the men when we are wronged
4790437 we want to be treated with respect and will seek resource if that is not done
4790438 its perfectly true to say that we should be worrying about kids who dont get the basic skills
4790439 but if we talk as though thats the only problem i think we begin to lose focus on the development of really high level skills they are the skills on which further learning depends
4790440 we realised there was no scientific basis and teh results are not consistent

4790442 finally my efforts have paid off arent i the smart and persistent one
4790443 what weve developed since 9 11 in six or seven years is a better understanding of the support that is necessary for terrorists the network which provides that support whether its financial or material or expertise
4790444 weve now begun to develop more sophisticated thoughts about deterrence looking at each one of those individually
4790445 if you can learn something about whatever is on those hard drives whatever that information might be you could instil doubt on their part by just counter messaging whatever it is they said they wanted to do or planned to do
4790446 our doctors strive to keep us eating healthy and staying fit those same words of advice are equally helpful for pets too
4790447 because men have always been in power when the writing and translations were done
4790448 early slaves therefore did not bring with them to america a very exalted idea of morals or of family life
4790449 people tend to assume that the nature of family life is about the same throughout american society
4790450 the family structure of lower class negroes is highly unstable and in many urban centers is approaching complete breakdown
4790451 a people thus handicapped ought not to be asked to race the world but rather allowed to give all its time and thought to its own social problems
4790452 the promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood is integral to successful child rearing and the well being of the children
4790453 men are sometimes active fathers although they avoid antagonistic state oversight

4790455 we civil society organisations from south africa zimbabwe and swaziland gathered at this meeting of sadc heads of state in johannesburg on august 16 2008 reassert our commitment to the struggle for a transition to democracy in zimbabwe and swaziland
4790456 swaziland has the oldest state of emergency in the region with all public institutions and decision making the monopoly and sole preserve of the royal family
4790457 years of convenient silence on swaziland have promoted a culture of impunity and disregard for the fundamentals of democracy in the whole region
4790458 we urge sadc to adopt a new sense of urgency to tackle the crises in zimbabwe and swaziland we have for too long allowed these illegitimate and undemocratic regimes to fester and begin to affect the entire fibre of the region
4790459 robert mugabe and mswati iii are not legitimate leaders of their countries and cannot claim any legitimacy to rule for they have not been democratically elected by the peoples of their countries
4790460 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4790461 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4790462 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4790463 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4790464 london used to be a fixture in our local music scene evidently he grew tired of our cheap rent and easily livability so he high tailed it to new york a few years back
4790465 alternates between sounding a bit like hush labelmate kind of like spitting r e m s michael stipe and well himself
4790466 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4790467 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4790468 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4790469 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4790470 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4790471 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4790472 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4790473 i had some food poisoning yesterday was sick in the night and didnt sleep much
4790474 i feel all right now but ive not eaten anything and didnt feel comfortable with my swing
4790475 i think ive put myself a little bit too far back but if i win tomorrow ill change my mind about taking next week off
4790476 i want to give myself every chance of course you can feel pressure playing at home but i think its more inspirational
4790477 both my wins have come from the front but i will take where i am right now
4790478 its just lovely to be in contention going into the final round

4790482 we had hoped the operator would comply with the ministry of the environment order and clean up the exterior of the properties
4790483 at this time its critical for the city to do whatever is necessary so that these residents can resume some sense of normalcy in their neighbourhood after this traumatic event

4790493 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4790494 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4790495 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4790496 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4790497 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4790498 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4790499 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4790500 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4790501 i just want to enjoy this moment because its a huge moment in my career

4790515 im very happy for the players it was a difficult game psychologically we played at home and had to win
4790516 i know that the next game we will play without pressure the main thing is to get a good rest
4790517 technically we feel more confident before we were losing by 20 or 30 points each match but its much better now
4790518 we fought hard to the end now we need to keep pushing ahead
4790519 they were just a little bit better defensively than we were and they made the big shots

4790530 democrats who control congress are not facing up to the challenge of developing a comprehensive energy policy
4790531 republicans have refused to leave the capitol this month and demanded a session on the energy crisis although the house chamber microphones are off lights are dimmed and the tv cameras are off
4790532 democrats who contend republicans have blocked numerous bills aimed at dealing with market speculators and forcing oil companies to drill in areas they have already leased have said the gop protest is a political stunt

4790539 i wonder if in the life of the church there have ever been a gathering quite like this
4790540 it was epic for the whole world to see how great you are

4790543 i knew michael is a back half swimmer and hed be chasing me down
4790544 i saw kind of a shadow by the side of my goggle i knew he was coming in
4790545 the last 15 meters the last eight meters i just put my head down i did not breathe the last eight meters i was just hoping for the best
4790546 when i chopped the last stroke i really thought it cost me the race
4790547 but it happened to be the exact opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i ended up making the right decision trying to take a short fast stroke to get my hand on the wall first
4790548 it was very clear the serbian swimmer had second after michael phelps
4790549 it is evident from the video that it was an issue of stroking one was stroking the other was gliding
4790550 i think if we got to do this again i would win it
4790551 whos going to do something thats going to make him extra terrestrial

4790555 general miles cannot tell the truth he will lie and hes lying to you now
4790556 most anonymous sources tell more than they know reporters who are allowed to use such sources sometimes write more than they hear editors too often let them get away with it result fiction gets mixed with fact
4790557 you have to think about your mind as a resource to conserve and if you fill it up with infantile garbage it might cost you something later there might be right theories that you will be unable to understand five years later because you have so many misconceptions you have to form the habit of not wanting to have been right for very long you can read what your contemporaries think but you should remember they are ignorant savages
4790558 the pennhurst story was and continues to be about failing to recognize the worth of people and places that whether we like or it not defines us
4790559 and all of a sudden one day we told them you cant do that anymore
4790560 people really believed that people with mental retardation had no feelings so they werent bothered by being naked in a room with 100 other naked people
4790561 its really odd what we are able to justify once we divorce ourselves from people
4790562 when we dehumanize and write off a segment of our society and render them non people we can get away with a lot of horrible things
4790563 it is a problem if we dont recall the mistakes we made as a society
4790564 in my judgment the state was derelict in letting this go on for decades
4790565 it might be far easier for a developer to retrofit and not tear them down
4790566 a restored pennhurst campus holds tremendous promise economically and environmentally that far outweighs those to be gained by tearing everything down and throwing up houses or a big box store
4790567 its part of our job to make sure people know what they have and what they stand to lose
4790568 its something im aiming for there are a few athletes at these olympics who are 40 plus im 35 now theres no reason why at 39 which is what ill be at the next games i cant do it
4790569 one of my goals has been the commonwealth games and the
4790570 its just about keeping my body fit keeping up my enthusiasm for tennis i think the quality of tennis we are playing is high quality and it shows theres no reason why i cant come back for a sixth olympics
4790571 if you are going to ask me what im going to do in 2012 i dont really know what im going to do next year right now

4790631 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4790632 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4790633 i think its important that the worlds oldest democracy must stand with one of the newest when its been illegally invaded by another country

4790635 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4790636 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4790637 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4790639 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4790640 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4790641 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4790642 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4790643 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4790644 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4790645 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4790646 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4790647 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4790648 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4790649 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4790650 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4790651 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4790652 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4790653 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4790654 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4790655 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

4790661 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4790662 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4790663 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4790664 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4790665 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4790666 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4790667 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4790668 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4790669 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4790670 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4790671 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4790672 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4790673 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4790674 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4790675 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4790676 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4790677 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4790678 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4790679 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4790680 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4790681 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4790682 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4790683 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4790684 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4790685 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4790686 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4790687 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4790688 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4790689 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4790690 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4790691 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4790692 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4790693 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4790694 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4790695 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4790696 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4790697 pero tal vez necesit un poco m s de entrenamiento y de competencia
4790698 incluso si llegaba a la final no creo que me hubiera sentido muy confiado
4790699 fernando gonz lez ya sabe lo que es ganar una medalla en atenas logr el oro en dobles y el bronce individual sabe lo que se siente en un acontecimiento como este para nadal ser un debut en una final ol mpica y su primer metal pero estoy seguro de que tendr una gran motivaci n ante este reto lleva una gran trayectoria creo que es el favorito
4790700 el final de temporada se presenta interesante para ver los acontecimientos y qui n ser el n mero uno del mundo a la conclusi n del ejercicio pero nadal merece sin discusi n ser el n mero uno ha hecho el mejor tenis del a o no hay duda ahora su reto ser mantenerlo todo lo que pueda
4790701 no s cuanto durar en el n mero uno porque en el tenis todo es impredecible todo puede ocurrir cualquier cosa cambia en una d cima de segundo si algo malo te ocurre una lesi n por ejemplo porque hay muchos torneos todo se viene abajo hay muchos jugadores pujando fuerte y dispuestos a conseguir el primer puesto del r nking
4790702 creo que es positivo que cada vez haya m s jugadores que aspiren a los grandes torneos hay una mayor competencia y eso es bueno para los aficionados y para el tenis en general
4790703 todo el mundo piensa que puedes hacerlo mucho mejor pero creo que ganar una medalla es de por s un gran xito
4790704 son completamente diferentes como para compararlas pero tienen m s o menos el mismo valor

4790717 i will pour out my spirit on all people your sons and your daughters will prophesy your young men will see visions your old men will dream dreams even on my servants both men and women i will pour out my spirit in those days and they will prophesy
4790718 as was taken for granted by the patristic commentators and indeed up to the middle ages the assumption that it must be male is a striking indictment of male presumption regarding the character and structure of earliest christianity
4790719 this guy could smother me and as much attention as he seems to be paying to me i could be dead for a while before he noticed
4790720 i can knock one out in 3 minutes cmon let me try

4790722 baghead is a movie about the funny horrific tragic terrible life of being a desperate actor
4790723 despu s de haber perdido en mi primer enfrentamiento lo estudi mucho mejor para esta pelea y creo que me sali todo muy bien
4790724 ganar a un rival de esta calidad te da confianza de cara al futuro pero cada pelea es distinta
4790725 la verdad es que mis piernas me respondieron las combinaciones de manos fueron precisas y tambi n los golpes
4790726 sigo con la mentalidad de ir pelea a pelea y al final el objetivo tendr que ser la medalla
4790727 soy consciente que para la pr xima pelea no salgo como favorito pero intentar darlo todo en el cuadril tero como hasta ahora
4790728 no voy a renunciar a luchar por la medalla pero estar en cuartos de final para m ya es todo un xito
4790729 ha sido un d a tranquilo me he entrenado bien he tenido buenas sensaciones y me siento bien ante la final
4790730 este xito tengo que agradec rselo a mi entrenador v ctor capacho que con mucha disciplina y cuatro a os de dura preparaci n me ha tra do hasta aqu
4790731 conozco mucho a paval y antes de la pelea de hoy estuve estudi ndola nos hemos enfrentado varias veces en el pasado y por ello creo que no hay secretos entre nosotras
4790732 giba es un l der muy importante para el equipo
4790733 el regreso de un jugador de la calidad de giba es muy importante para cualquier equipo y tambi n para nosotros y m s si es un l der natural del grupo la prueba es la gran cantidad de momentos de dificultad que hemos superado gracias a l y a su influencia
4790734 mejoramos en todas las facetas del juego y los centrales estuvieron muy acertados si miramos las estad sticas de nuestro anterior partido ante rusia se ve que cometimos muchos errores y no podemos hacer estos regalos a nadie y menos a equipos potentes
4790735 hoy hemos vuelto a nuestro juego de continuidad en todas las acciones y de pocos errores es lo que nos ha dado la victoria
4790736 he llegado con una gran preparaci n listo no s lo para ganar esta pelea sino la siguiente y asegurar una medalla que haga feliz a todo ecuador
4790737 sab a que pod a ganar a mi rival pero si hac a lo que me aconsejaron los preparadores y cuidaba mi condici n f sica
4790738 estoy listo para alcanzar la meta m s alta en la competici n y esta victoria me da la confianza que necesito
4790739 no hay que jugar partidos antes de tiempo y tampoco juzgar por un s lo partido la clave es que nos centramos en polonia y s lo pensamos en polonia contra rusia jugamos mal y perdimos pero s lo eso no hay que sacar otras conclusiones
4790740 parece que no tenemos derecho a jugar mal y a perder un partido el rival tambi n juega y cuando no estamos acertados podemos perder sin que eso signifique que ya vamos a perder todos los partidos que nos queden
4790741 no vamos a descubrir a giba ahora para nosotros es fundamental somos un equipo muy conjuntado y cuando falta una de sus piezas se nota y mucho
4790742 ahora vamos a seguir igual pensando s lo en el pr ximo rival cuando conozcamos a nuestro rival en cuartos ya pensaremos en l pero no podemos pensar m s adelante ni en la disputa de las medallas
4790743 sobis siempre se port muy bien y lo est haciendo realmente bien en los entrenamientos
4790744 duro y dif cil como siempre lo es ante camer n
4790745 si los equipos jugase abiertos ante brasil brasil jugar a tambi n abierto y bonito
4790746 cuando ocurre lo de hoy s lo queda jugar para vencer
4790747 no ayud nada a practicar f tbol de alto nivel y dificult mucho a brasil
4790748 el estadio es fant stico pero el c sped que es lo m s importante no ayud nada
4790749 si camer n hubiese jugado con once el resultado podr a haber sido otro diferente
4790750 no podemos acusar a camer n de haber jugado mal lo hicimos con diez hombres y llegamos a la pr rroga no estamos de acuerdo con todas las decisiones adoptadas por el rbitro
4790751 este equipo ser la base del camer n que participar en el mundial de sud frica 2010
4790752 son jugadores muy j venes estoy satisfecho de ellos seguro que tienen m s oportunidades
4790753 no vinimos aqu a defender pero hoy jugamos contra brasil y tuvimos problemas con las tarjetas y las lesiones
4790754 nadal es el mejor jugador del momento es un portento f sico y es un merecido n mero uno del mundo va a ser un partido muy dif cil
4790755 nos conocemos bien hemos jugado varias veces es el mejor del momento pero yo tambi n estoy bien jugu a un gran nivel contra blake que fue uno de mis mejores encuentros
4790756 claro que tengo opciones este es un momento muy importante para m s lo que tengo que hacer
4790757 el rojo es cido como la fresa y dulce como la sand a pero duele cuando se asoma por el rasp n de su rodilla
4790758 son representaciones t ctiles de objetos de acuerdo a un color
4790759 el libro enfoca el dif cil tema de un ni o ciego pero no es presentado como un minusv lido ni siquiera se habla de ceguera en lugar de ver a tom s como un discapacitado su amigo piensa que tiene poderes especiales porque el ni o invidente huele saborea oye y toca los colores tom s tiene poderes porque puede percibir m s cosas tiene m s sensibilidad ser discapacitado ya no es un handycap
4790760 la idea es que cualquiera se enfrente a la realidad de un ciego
4790761 es un libro objeto que no s lo se lee y mira sino que se puede tocar plantea una t cnica nueva de ahora en adelante a lo mejor se podr n ilustrar libros para invidentes
4790762 ha sido una de las experiencias m s extraordinarias que he vivido jam s como ilustradora de libros para ni os
4790763 segundo a tradi o quando os sacerdotes eg pcios herdeiros da sabedoria atl ntida eram ainda guardi es dos mist rios sagrados o grande hierofante prevendo uma poca de decaimento espiritual da humanidade e a persegui o ao ensinamento sagrado convocou ao templo todos os s bios sacerdotes do egito para que juntos pudessem achar um meio de preservar da destrui o os ensinamentos inici ticos permitindo assim o seu uso s gera es de um futuro distante
4790764 mira detr s de la silla azul en el comedor
4790765 a solid b minus effort and coxs performance makes it eminently watchable
4790766 i came here just to win and i did just that i didnt even know id broken the world record until i did my victory lap
4790767 when i ran the earlier round i felt the world record because its a new track and its fast but i came out here just to win im so happy for myself and my country
4790768 me and my coach we decided that i can take both the 100m and 200m so i came here prepared and im going to try and do it
4790769 he could have run faster if he had wanted to
4790770 cuando estoy tenso me gusta pegarle fuerte al domi la paleta de entrenamiento soltar la pagada sudar desgastarse un poquito eso es bueno para soltar toda la adrenalina
4790771 estoy tratando de mantener mi peso estoy desayunando ligero como cereal y fruta la comida la hago fuerte y para la cena algo ligero
4790772 mantener el peso cuidar la categor a porque hay que mantener una alimentaci n balanceada
4790773 estamos dedicados a aflojar las piernas sacar el nervio sacar todo lo trabajado ya est trabajado no se puede trabajar m s ahora nada m s soltar la tensi n
4790774 puede ser el campe n ol mpicos el campe n mundial o el que me toque o que no sea conocido porque estoy preparado para lo que sea
4790775 estamos concentrados en que el rival que nos toque hay que derrotarlo
4790776 quer a conseguir este tipo de victoria demostrar que estoy en gran momento de forma y que he asimilado todas las ense anzas que me han dado
4790777 creo que tengo fuerza para luchar por la medalla y tambi n para estar en la final pero ir poco a poco
4790778 nunca un equipo de cuba con j venes que estaban programados para hacer su aparici n en la siguiente olimpiada hab a demostrado tanta clase
4790779 estoy muy contento pero ahora es cuando llega la fase decisiva de las medallas y veremos a ver lo que sucede

4790835 there are over 74 millions dogs owned in the united states according to the humane society of the united states which works out to about 39 of households in the u s who need dog training
4790836 many people dont even bother with a basic puppy kindergarten and with over 10 of those 74 million dogs being adopted from shelters there are a lot of bad dog and human habits to break which is where sit means sit comes in
4790837 we see amazing results with dogs and trainers every day the sit means sit remote dog collar does nothing but help a dog stay focused and truly be all they can be once people have the facts and see the results they are so excited almost as excited as we are
4790838 the most amazing process to watch is when a dog owner sees their companion truly listening responding and behaving once that happens the sky is the limit which is why we have so many students coming back to us to become sit means sit trainers
4790839 we work hard to support our new locations but truly the best part of our business is the passion that remote collar dog and puppy training brings out in people which is what makes these locations successful our dogs are actually our best advocates and the fun part is most of our students and even our teachers are just regular people some of our trainers had experience as canine police officers we even have a fema dog handlers but just as many are regular people who had regular jobs before this we have school teachers and restaurant owners and they are great trainers and are making a great living
4790840 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4790841 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good

4790845 i thought oh my god who is this guy but man what songs he wrote for us
4790846 like rock groups i always wanted to present songs as dramas it was something white artists did so well but black folks hadnt got into
4790847 which was why i picked those if you like white songs for that set because they had that dramatic content and i knew it would work too

4790866 the proposed regulations greatly undermine the acts purpose to conserve endangered and threatened species and appear to contravene the plain language of the act i therefore urge that you discontinue any further action on the proposed rule
4790867 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
4790868 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse place on earth
4790869 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
4790870 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
4790871 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
4790872 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
4790873 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent

4790880 i was trying to stop but i built up too much momentum
4790881 i surf and stuff but when it comes to jumping into a pool i get scared they thought i could jump off like nothing i never rode a rollercoaster before every time we go to an adventure park id have to wait for my family until after they rode the roller coaster
4790882 people dont know but im scared of heights ive never rode a roller coaster
4790883 i had to do it again i had to break the fear
4790884 i was kinda scared at first but the adrenaline gets you pumped so i just did it i just went up there i looked went back and ran off and jumped all the rookies have to do it
4790885 i wasnt scared to jump off but i wanted to do a gainer thats what made me nervous
4790886 weve had 13 practices i think its a good day to cut back go have some fun
4790887 i think weve become a team these last two practices
4790888 ok i will just try my best if i fail then maybe take it again no big deal
4790889 no not yet just every day im trying to come out here and focus get better trying to learn from all the coaches just watching videos theres stuff that we can improve on coach ron lee the offensive coordinator is stressing the little points now just come out here and strive for perfection
4790890 he has handled it really well i tell you what hes going to get just as much playing time as the ones as long as he gets his plays down right and he gets the fine tuning
4790891 at 5 11 190 pounds pilares feels comfortable enough where he is to call slot his
4790892 its going to be a constant rotation kealoha we cant waste a guy like that hes probably one of our best athletes on offense he needs to be on the field and be on the field a lot
4790893 i know yoda bain and mike theyve been here a long time and are just waiting for their shot but like everyone i want to start but team comes first and i think this years team is way different from last years team because we have depth everyones going to be running hard every play guys can just come and fill in from where mike and yoda started thats what were trying to work on depth and just having coach lee leave us with confidence
4790894 me and him were in the same position so weve been learning a lot if he was to step up to the line next to me i would feel confident just like if he was another returnee someone who was there just as long as me i want to see him in the open field with the rock
4790895 antoine mother and father are waiting down in the library
4790896 they sent me up to get you and i dont know
4790897 you cant tell mother and father anything of what happened promise me jeanette
4790898 i dont want you to go do it for me if for no one else
4790899 did you ever consider that her father didnt know she had come here
4790900 that didnt give him the right to come here and insult me mama insult you
4790901 what was i supposed to do get down on the floor and lick his boots
4790902 i will not have it he wont face them he wont
4790903 i dont ever want to know how this came about antoine
4790904 do you know why albert morris dislikes us so much
4790905 though monsieur morris is much older than i he was still in the prime of his life when your mother came of age his family at that time were quite friendly with your mothers family the valmonts
4790906 once she came of age albert went to any means to secure the hand of your mother she turned him away time and again finally he promised to pay the valmonts a dowry of a thousand dollars for her hand by this time he had already fathered the two men you fought tonight charles and drake
4790907 but with the morris familys connections he raised them on his estate pretending the mother had left him everyone knew differently of course but not a soul in town would challenge that gang of criminals
4790908 but with this dowry albert believed the valmonts would accept his proposal and marry off their daughter without question
4790909 one day after two weeks of being turned away by your mother and her family even kept off the grounds of the valmont estate albert finally cornered your mother and her sister coming out of the harriers
4790910 it had rained that day many people have not forgotten that episode least of all your mother and of course old albert then he married and had clarissa about the same time you came along he never forgave your mother for turning him down for humiliating him in front of everyone your mother swore she would never be bought not by any man
4790911 don t blame yourself antoine i know for a fact that clarissa is nothing like her father
4790912 but now antoine you have become his hated enemy and you must face up to what you did
4790913 rhyanon are you even listening to a word i say
4790914 yes father i hear you but i wont marry just because you want me to i dont love him
4790915 love what does that have to do with it its a good match i tell you and dont give me any more nonsense about him smelling bad thats all in your head hes a pleasant responsible young man and hell take over that whole fur business one day
4790916 it would match very well with mine when it comes to you girl and you just think on that
4790917 that rhya was the boundary to the stedding this place once belonged to the ogier and they allowed us to live here because their numbers had dwindled and this stedding is so out of the way that they thought it would serve our purposes very well no one can cross that boundary without feeling something to some it is a feeling of wonder and joy to others it is a feeling of loss and despair it all depends on what you bring with you
4790918 come on we have a ways to go yet before we actually reach the place where we all live and i for one intend to have a tankard of my favourite ale tonight i have been too long away from the stedding
4790919 i have missed you as well ice but we have a guest and you should say hello to her as well you know
4790920 yes ice she is a new cub this is her first time in the stedding and i am taking her to see miryana to make sure there is nothing wrong with rhya come on rhya if we let her ice will have us standing here all day
4790921 she particularity likes having her ears stroked but if you start she will try and keep you at it for the rest of the day

4790931 the stedding is home and sanctuary to many wolfkin rhya i hope in time you will come to think of us as family as we are one if not related by blood

4790944 your new charge is fit and fed my friend she is ready for you to find her a place to sleep until you can begin her training
4790945 i think i will its much larger than i expected the stedding
4790946 if you get lost just ask for directions everyone knows the tree house
4790947 whitewolf gives his thanks wind over the water may your pack grow strong and live long
4790948 is this not unusual owen first our being sent to find keyl and now this
4790949 if i live to be a hundred years old aleeza i doubt i will ever fully understand the minds of the wolves even ice is a mystery to me at times but we will have to leave discussions of this nature to a later date i must be off you know how to get yourself home make sure you stay out of sight and travel as safely as you can i will do my best to catch you up but do not tarry for me not unless you have no other choice find me in the dream if your need is urgent and i will do all i can to find you
4790950 please do not run i am here to help you my name is owen and i know what you are going through it happened to me as well some time ago
4790951 i come from a place to the west of here a wolf who told me about you and asked that i come and help you contacted me so here i am
4790952 please do not run i really am here to help you and if you will let me i will see to it that no harm comes to you all i want is to sit and talk with you for a while to explain some things to you that will help you face the challenges before you
4790953 do not let my appearance trouble you i have always looked this way and it has nothing to do with what you are experiencing right now come sit with me for a while ask the questions i know you are burning to ask i will try and provide all the answers i can
4790954 who are you what wolf why are your eyes that colour how did you know where i was where did you come from are there others
4790955 first let me introduce myself my name is owen and among my kin i am also known as white fang that is the name given to me by the wolves i come from a place in the mountains of mist where there are many like me and like you to we live there in safety from those two legs who would do us harm and are hell bent on persecuting our kind
4790956 you will not be harmed nor is there any danger now that i am here i can guide you and teach you how to control your new abilities if you agree to come with me to my home you will find many there that are like us all of whom have been through the same thing you are experiencing
4790957 if you are hungry you can share my supplies with me you will need to keep your strength up if you are to accompany me back to my home
4790958 i know all of this must seem overwhelming and that your brain feels like it is about to explode from your head but you are not going mad nor are you turning into shadowspawn you have been chosen by the wolves why we are chosen remains a mystery to many of our kind and the wolves do not explain why either i would ask that you trust me for now i will not harm you nor will i allow others to harm you if you decide not to accompany me then you can leave any time you like but that would not be the best course of action and might lead to problems that you are not capable of handling
4790959 it would be helpful if i knew your name there is no harm in knowing that is there again owen smiled his eyes sparkling with inner warmth
4790960 where is home owen we can actually speak to the wolves theyre real not just in my head i thought i was going mad or imagining things at least
4790961 it is good to make your acquaintance rhya and i would be honoured to count you as one of my friends no harm will come to you while you are with me or when you are in the stedding
4790962 our home is at the base of the mountains of the mist it is surrounded by a great forest one that helps conceal us from unwanted eyes and makes it easy to hide our presence there there s a large lake where you can swim if you want we have stables and smithy an infirmary barracks a silversmith and the most amazing inn it was constructed with the help of the ogier and truly has to be seen to be believed
4790963 speaking to the wolves is not entirely accurate they do not use words like you or i might they send images pictures if you like we have to try and unravel what they want us to know you may find some wolves to be condescending many of them see us as their pups and treat us accordingly even my own companion behaves like that towards me i am convinced she thinks she is my mother at times
4790964 i know all of this must seem very confusing and will continue to do so for many days to come for now you will have to rely on me to help you come to terms with this but when we get to the stedding there will be many others there to help you work through this confusion i spend a lot of time away from the stedding but whenever i am there you are more than welcome to come visit me in my tree house i am sure ice will be pleased to see you as well
4790965 i spend a lot of time away from the stedding but whenever i am there you are more than welcome to come visit me in my tree house i am sure ice will be pleased to see you as well
4790966 ice is your companion id like to visit you both thank you
4790967 how soon will we need to leave is it a long journey i uhh i was followed before i think i lost them but well its maybe not safe to stay too long my horse was wandering somewhere he ermm he threw me and i just ran
4790968 in that case rhya we had better be on our way now although i am considered skilled with my weapons there are times when discretion is the better part of valour and i believe now would be one such time
4790969 we cannot ride for long not if we want to cover a long distance and have my horse survive but we can ride for a couple of hours then walk for a couple of hours i am afraid you will not be getting much sleep tonight as i want to travel well into the night this will allow us to take advantage of our enhanced night vision and should allow us to put some space between ourselves and our pursuers
4790970 i dont know who they picked up my trail before id even entered the woods part of the caravan i was traveling with i think we took on so many temporary guards at the last stop there were three of them i am sure of that theres been no sign of them since i found the clearing though i lost them a good way before that maybe they just wanted my horse he was a fine stallion and worth a pretty penny to someone who knows horseflesh
4790971 i certainly dont have much else worth the taking we had not yet been paid for the journey
4790972 owen how did you come to have ice as a companion
4790973 ice and her brother shadow i rescued when their mother had was killed i was with my
4790974 well let us just say i was heading north towards tarwins gap when i came across ice shadow and their dead mother there was no way i could leave two young cubs to certain death they were only a week or so old at the time and could not fend for themselves even though i knew i could have been heading for my death at tarwins gap i knew they would stand a better chance with me than if i left them by there i guess the two of them decided that i was the mother they had lost ice decided to stay with me shadow took a different route but eventually came back to ice and myself although i would say he is not my companion more like a distant cousin he visits every now and then but the loss of the one he loved has left a scar on him
4790975 he stays with ice and i more often than not these days but will go off on his own without letting us know where or for how long typical male eh
4790976 how long will it be until we get there to the stedding
4790977 we still have two days ahead of us before we come to the edge of the great forest that surrounds the stedding rhya once we get to the forest we have another days travel to arrive at the stedding but i think when you get there that you will agree with me that it is a journey worth making the forest is one of the oldest we know of having survived from the time of manetheren that ancient kingdom that was ever a thorn in the side of the dark one who knows one day it may prove so again
4790978 it is said that each wolf passes on its memories to the cubs in the pack this allows them to keep alive memories from the distant past however do not expect them to tell you anything they only pass on knowledge when they deem it appropriate and not when we want them to again they treat us like unruly children who have to be protected from themselves
4790979 now before we begin i have to warn you that entering the dream before you are prepared can be very dangerous what happens to you there can affect you in the waking world you can just as easily die there as you could here and if you die there you die here as well there is no second chance
4790980 the first step is to enter the dream itself dont let it bother you if it does not happen at first it is difficult at best to make yourself fall asleep the best way is to focus on your breathing close your eyes
4790981 do not try to force it just relax and drift feel your muscles relaxing youre breathing easing focus on the wolves and moving to a spiritual place
4790982 do not try to force it just relax and drift feel your muscles relaxing your breathing easing focus on the wolves and moving to a spiritual place
4790983 in the dream control is everything and that is what you are going to learn first your first lesson will be to control your clothing at the moment your emotions are interfering with your control that is why you clothing flickers like it does now you need to hold an image of your self and how you want to look in your mind once you learn to do this then this will not be possible
4790984 rhya looked around apprehensively thinking something untoward was going to appear
4790985 check your clothes rhya i think you might be a little old to be dressed like that mind you your hair looks cute in pigtails
4790986 this is your first lesson rhya and although you have already exhibited some control over your appearance you need to realise that i have more skill here and can do things to you that you cannot anticipate please try and change your clothes and your appearance back to how you want concentrate on how you want to appear here your clothes and your hair picture yourself in your mind and fix that image there it will take you some time to be able to do this without conscious thought but we have plenty of time for you to practice
4790987 once you learn to do this then this will not be possible
4790988 she glanced quickly around wondering what she had missed fighting to keep her fears at bay but owen soon directed her attention to her clothes
4790989 his full name on our tongue is shadow falling across the moon although even that is only an approximation of his full name and yes you are correct in that he and ice are related she is his sister and has always looked out for him ices full name is icewind on a cold dark night
4790990 although she does not like being called that and much prefers ice
4790991 i think you will find you have made a friend this night rhya i do not think it amiss to say we are keeping this in the family
4790992 i think that we should return the main reason we are here this night and focus on the lesson in hand
4790993 so with that in mind shall we get back to the lesson for tonight so do you always wear mens clothing and cover your face in soot
4790994 i think you will find you have made a friend this night rhya i do not think it amiss to say we are keeping this in the family
4790995 so with that in mind shall we get back to the lesson for tonight so do you always wear mens clothing and cover your face in soot
4790996 ok ok point taken you know far more about this and i have a lot to learn
4790997 mostly is what we all aim for her and then hope that we do no end up hurting of selves with the remainder that we do not know or cannot foresee even for those who have had a lot of experience here there are times when we do not know what the outcome of our actions here will be so always remember to be as careful and as methodical as you can here although that does not mean there is no fun to be had but for now let us press on with the next part of this lesson this will be slightly more difficult but again at its core is control
4790998 now what i want you to do is try and change this rock to something else what it is is up to you
4790999 now obviously your first attempt will not be like this one so i suggest you try something simple for now and see how you get on
4791000 now just picture an every day object or an object that is very important to you hold that focus as intently as you can and aim it at the rock this is not an easy task for someone new to this so expect to be practising this for several nights to come if necessary we can come back here every night until you can achieve this without a problem so take a deep breath compose yourself and begin when you are ready
4791001 yes you did but this takes practice rhya its time to stop though weve been in the dream long enough you can continue this tomorrow night after some rest
4791002 owen how long can a person stay here does anyone actually stay in the dream
4791003 it is said that when a wolf dies that they live on in here how exactly i am not sure but it has been known to happen maybe you should be asking shadow that question although i would wager you will get the same answer from him as i always get from ice
4791004 now where would the fun be in it if i go and tell you when you feel up to it just ask shadow and then you can tell me what he says
4791005 i do know that the longer we stay here the less sleep we get or should i say our sleep is not as restful as it would be if we were not here although in the waking world our bodies are asleep it is not the sleep that brings total refreshment too many nights of that and we would be of no use to anyone and would spend most of our days walking around in a daze i would say that if we continued to do that then sooner or later we would pass out and either die from exhaustion or not regain consciousness until our bodies had recovered
4791006 and of course you would have handled it differently would you not oh mighty one
4791007 not really rhya when i did this i actually sank all the way and thought i was going to die obviously wolflover knew i would not be hurt the only hurt was to my pride once she explained to me what it was i should have done
4791008 remember what i said at the very beginning everything here is dependent on control the more you can remain in control of your emotions and your thoughts the easier this place is to understand when you combine that with the lesson earlier on how to change objects you would have found the way to easily escape the predicament you were in
4791009 panic became the main emotion for you that meant you were not thinking clearly and acting in haste which meant you forgot the earlier lesson instead of struggling with the rope you should have made the ground under you not around you solid that way you could have just stepped out of the quicksand and been on your way because you let panic rule you you forgot and so caused yourself more problems than you needed
4791010 do not be too hard on yourself rhya like i said i made an even worse go of it than you did we all learn in our own way what is important is to never make the same mistake twice now off to bed with you i will see you in the morning
4791011 so you do remember your lessons white fang i was beginning to wonder
4791012 si t parezco tonta a ti q es mi problema no pq si soy tan tonta entonces q t importa tanto
4791013 posting a 184 percent year over year increase compared to a 53 percent year over year increase in default notices and an 11 percent year over year increase in auction notices
4791014 i dont think we should lose ourselves in long discussions about responsibility and blame for the escalation of recent days
4791015 look to the future and take a role in further stabilization
4791016 the blame game and the tough talk will start at a later stage
4791017 for the first time in quite a while our neighbours in the east have once again shown the face which we have known for hundreds of years these neighbours feel that the nations around them should be subservient to them we say no
4791018 only option to prevent similar acts of aggression and occupation of georgia in the future is to extend to georgia the nato membership action plan
4791019 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of the georgian port of poti is a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4791020 russia is a very strong country in terms of economic development it helps compensate for weaker growth in other regions
4791021 by bringing additional pro american oriented countries into the alliance nato
4791022 difficult decision to recognise kosovo it is clear that with our foreign policy we have reached russias tolerance level
4791023 president sarkozys shuttle diplomacy between moscow and tbilisi is highly risky
4791024 president bushs weakness at the sad conclusion of his mandate puts the european union in the front row when it comes to replacing weapons with diplomacy in georgia the eu 27 hold all the aces when it comes to getting the kremlins ear especially in the economic sense but the question remains as to whether the europeans will play their aces which assumes they will speak with one voice and there is nothing less certain than that
4791025 if u been dating a guy for 4 months and havent met his friends or family u are not his girlfriend
4791026 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
4791027 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control so what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks in a word
4791028 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
4791029 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others
4791030 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
4791031 the u s has long been involved in supporting freedom movements throughout this region that have been attempting to replace russian influence with u s corporate control the cia national endowment for democracy and freedom house includes zbigniew brzezinski former cia director james woolsey and obama foreign policy adviser anthony lake have been key funders and supporters of placing politicians in power throughout central asia that would play ball with our side none of this is about the good guys versus the bad guys it is power bloc politics big money is at stake b oth parties republican and democrat share a bi partisan history and agenda of advancing corporate interests in this part of the world obamas advisers just like mccains one of his top advisers was recently a lobbyist for the current government in georgia are thick in this stew
4791032 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies if he disobeyed them hed be gone in a fortnight besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if its perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance nothing was left to chance
4791033 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
4791034 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
4791035 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
4791036 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday
4791037 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
4791038 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
4791039 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
4791040 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee
4791041 terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups
4791042 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
4791043 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
4791044 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
4791045 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
4791046 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
4791047 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
4791048 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
4791049 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
4791050 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
4791051 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things
4791052 sanofi pasteur the vaccines division of sanofi aventis group announced today that the us department of health and human services hhs has accepted h5n1 bulk vaccine antigen to produce approximately 38
4791053 donate 60 million doses of h5n1 vaccine to the world health organization who over 3 years for the establishment of an h5n1 vaccine global stockpile
4791054 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
4791055 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players
4791056 a disease that turned people the color of wet ashes and drowned them in the fluids of their own bodies and inspired names like the purple death
4791057 the transformation of poultry production in asia in recent decades is staggering in the southeast asian countries where most of the bird flu outbreaks are concentrated thailand indonesia and viet nam production jumped eightfold in just 30 years from around 300 000 metric tonnes mt of chicken meat in 1971 to 2 440 000 mt in 2001 chinas production of chicken tripled during the 1990s to over 9 million metric tons per year
4791058 what is shocking is the speed of the collapse in germany
4791059 i think there has been a lot of hubris at the ecb they took a derisory attitude towards the us saying the federal reserve was too aggressive in cutting rates now they are reaping the bitter reward of their policy
4791060 the confidence expressed by some observers that weaker economic growth will lead to a damping of inflation pressures is in my opinion premature
4791061 they boxed themselves in and it became hard to retreat it is clear from the august bulletin that they have now really woken up to the downturn
4791062 recessions in europe are very nasty events they tend to be a lot deeper and more protracted than in the us which is better able to cope with the ups and downs of the business cycle
4791063 the bursting of the emu credit bubble seems imminent and will reveal current account imbalances among euro area countries as extremely dangerous the medium term feasibility of the euro area in its current form must be open to very considerable doubt
4791064 a momentous economic slowdown is now under way we believe the deterioration in spain is just in the beginning stages

4791077 people are either older and want to protect their own assets or they have been through a separation before and they want to make sure they are protected
4791078 people are more savvy these days perhaps they have less expectation that their relationship is going to last forever
4791079 if they are sitting down and talking about one aspect of their lives they might as well work out lifestyle clauses as well
4791080 it depends on the personalities involved and the relative positions of those involved
4791081 its amazing how many people come in and say i dont know how i am going to broach that with my partner but you have got to talk about wills and death and thats not very nice either

4791086 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4791087 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4791088 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4791089 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4791090 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4791091 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4791092 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4791093 additional security measures taken by the russian peacekeeping contingent which will be strengthened as these measures of addition security are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4791094 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4791095 there questions are not decided by condoleezza rice or somebody else they are decided first of all by the side that has suffered in the conflict
4791096 what peacekeepers from what countries are needed for the people of south ossetia to feel comfortable is a primarily up to the people of south ossetia
4791097 eu n o sabia que tinha batido o recorde at dar minha volta da vit ria
4791098 encaro como um jogo normal mas n o nego que fica mais f cil para mim pelo tempo que eu passei no clube conhe o as caracter sticas dos jogadores e vou passar tudo o que sei e o que o professor precisar
4791099 conhe o muito bem o keirrison tanto dentro quanto fora de campo se n s dermos chance ele pode aproveitar
4791100 eles t m jogadores que podem ser diferenciados no meio campo como o marlos que tem uma habilidade fora do normal tem tamb m o guaru outro canhoto que tem crescido no 3 6 1 que eles jogam mas acredito que vai jogar o marlos que encosta bem como segundo atacante com o keirrison
4791101 na montagem do time sempre o que cai na nossa m o s o os atacantes mas ainda tem o rubens cardoso lateral esquerdo que enfia bem as bolas para eles tenho conversado muito com o pessoal da nossa defesa
4791102 no m ximo at amanh s bado ao meio dia ou no come o da tarde teremos algumas defini es que estavam sendo discutidas foi feita uma avalia o pela comiss o t cnica nos ltimos jogos e a decis o da diretoria ser anunciada a situa o extremamente delicada me sinto constrangido em estar aqui tendo que justificar mais uma derrota mas n o tenho nada a esconder da torcida
4791103 n s estamos esbarrando em algumas coisas e precisamos de solu o n o vou falar em quantidade e posi es pois temos que ter tranq ilidade e calma para evitar injusti a nosso grande problema a parte financeira na serie b a maioria dos jogadores j cumpriu os sete jogos e n o podem sair dos times temos que ver na s rie c ou s rie a mas da esbarramos nos altos sal rios

4791109 i have never heard of what youre talking about i will put my hand on a bible
4791110 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
4791111 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
4791112 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
4791113 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
4791114 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
4791115 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement
4791116 what possible difference could it make it was all 25 years ago
4791117 i wish him well but i dont talk to reporters
4791118 they are questioning the commander as to why his forces are still here
4791119 they have a very strong presence here in the town of gori and are encamped outside and dug in under camouflage
4791120 the russian troops are wandering around freely they are talking through intepreters and it looks quite tense
4791121 our understanding is that the agreement has been signed and russian troops are starting to withdraw but there are a lot of units scattered around this area
4791122 my understanding is that the process will take some time
4791123 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4791124 focused on neutralising the danger which is coming from the huge depots of ammunition and military equipment which have been left by the georgian army
4791125 now russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its
4791126 they are taking up defensive positions 2km north of kaspi junction and there is word of talks between georgian and russian troops
4791127 it appears the russians are not going anywhere at least not until they are ready
4791128 we are now in peacetime why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore
4791129 this therefore can only be yet another completely unverified statement we are not conducting bombardments i can say with full responsibility that this cannot be the case
4791130 the original six point plan had a different sixth point it only said that the status of abhazia and south ossetia would be up for negotiation in talks by the international community
4791131 what the russians did on tuesday was add an extra dimension to that they said that they want to have international peacekeepers in the two breakaway regions russian peacekeepers as well as the removal of georgian forces from both zones
4791132 quite clearly what saakashvili has agreed to is a reduction in any influence on the georgian side in these two areas
4791133 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4791134 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4791135 taty sei la mia migliore amica e con te sono stata sempre sincera lo so che io per te non sono altro che una semplice amica come tanti ma ti voglio bene

4791138 the order reinforces a growing bunker mentality within an epa that is the subject of a growing number of probes into political interference with agency operations
4791139 inside the current epa candor has become the cardinal sin
4791140 this directive is of questionable legality an agency specialist risks discipline or even termination for disregarding a direct order
4791141 the clear intention behind this move is to chill the cubicles by suppressing any uncontrolled release of information
4791142 stephen johnson is turning the epa into a secretive dangerous ally of polluters instead of a leader in the effort to protect the health and safety of the american people
4791143 procedure was developed in part to respond to a recent ig report
4791144 uncovered what appears to be an effort by the bush cheney administration to shield the truth about the effects of global warming from congress and the american people by interfering with scientific conclusions and regulatory decisions that congress intended to be answered by the science experts at epa
4791145 there are serious questions whether the white house improperly influenced epa to deny californias request for a clean air act waiver
4791146 this waiver would not only have allowed california to enforce tougher emissions standards it would have allowed other states including vermont to do the same
4791147 this is only the latest skirmish in what has come to be called the bush cheney administrations war on science in which powerful and well connected special interests get their way at the expense of ordinary americans
4791148 i am disappointed that the bush administration has again chosen secrecy over accountability
4791149 they are preventing the environmental protection agency from giving congress information about its policies and preventing us from learning what they are doing to enforce or not enforce vital laws meant to protect the water we drink and the air we breathe
4791150 yet another in a long line of examples of the bush administration hiding behind a thick veil of secrecy
4791151 when i recently appeared before the senate committee on environment and public works i promised that epa would operate in a fishbowl
4791152 for time 150 wallball shots 20 pound ball or 200 with 12lb ball 5 rounds of 20 box jumps 24
4791153 the senates failure to pass the mining law would leave citizens virtually powerless to protect drinking water
4791154 congress has closed lands to mining for wilderness national parks wildlife refuges recreation areas and wild and scenic rivers
4791155 what were seeing here is that the cost of remediating a big uranium mill is astronomical
4791156 in this case as in many others the company responsible has skipped out of town without paying much of anything and left taxpayers paying
4791157 the big threat right now is some kind of high water year or a really dramatic thunderstorm
4791158 the pile blocks a large drainage route out of arches national park a flash flood could wash a lot of tailings into the river
4791159 the patios are closed now and at home were digging out our scarves and in a few weeks well leave them at the bar where if weve got the nerve to try and share this part of life well run out arm in arm drunk scared and bare necked into the night

4791176 persecution is a bad and indirect way to plant religion
4791177 instead of pursuing her appointed path of separation persecution world hatred poverty and non resistance the church has used
4791178 to speak plainly among all the churches in the world which are free from idolatry and persecution it is not different opinions nor a difference in judgment about revealed truths nor a different practice in sacred administrations but pride self interest love of honour reputation and dominion with the influence of civil or political intrigues and considerations that are the true cause of that defect of evangelical unity that is at this day amongst them
4791179 cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger fatherless and widow and all the people shall say amen
4791180 and oppress not the widow nor the fatherless the stranger nor the poor and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart
4791181 it is necessary to help others not only in our prayers but in our daily lives if we find we cannot help others the least we can do is to desist from harming them

4791210 theyre just trying to reconstruct the migrant labor supply that was blown to pieces by the raid
4791211 i didnt want to uproot someone and them be treated poorly
4791212 they were people that came up here looking for a handout
4791213 there are not that many opportunities for work here and the opportunities there are are low paying

4791216 in taiwan air pollution is a very serious problem in the city
4791217 which would be adequate for usage in the city we would need an air compressor to refuel most likely at a fueling station
4791218 we dont think its a viable product because youre talking about a very very limited amount of compressed air you can put on a bike
4791219 we have a vehicle that will address that market but its not a motorcycle
4791220 the good thing is you could put a compressed air station on campuses in malls

4791225 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4791226 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4791227 witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described in tskhinvali

4791232 sao paulo are a team who are always fighting with gremio in the copa libertadores or the domestic tournament
4791233 it will be a great match a show worth seeing our opponents know that a defeat will widen the gap
4791234 i wouldnt say that this is a final because the people know that the brasileiro doesnt finish on sunday but it is a decisive game
4791235 were aware of what this game means to us but we have other important matches ahead after this
4791236 we are going to do our best to nullify vitorias attackers
4791237 they are a fast squad with good aerial power so we will have to be careful not to make any mistakes near the box

4791266 ich bin sehr zufrieden denn nun habe ich die chance auf ein gutes resultat unabh ngig vom wetter morgen
4791267 ich hoffe dass es morgen nicht regnen wird denn ich glaube dass wir ein starkes rennen drauf haben und dass wir ein w rtchen um das podium mitreden werden
4791268 es war ganz anders als gestern was ich gut fand denn die wettervorhersage ist nicht eindeutig so hatten wir zumindest gelegenheit bei allen bedingungen am setup zu t fteln
4791269 auch zwischen heute morgen und heute nachmittag war der unterschied gro denn am nachmittag war es viel nasser ich fand trotzdem guten grip und bekam eine recht flotte zeit hin
4791270 zumindest hat sich loris nicht verletzt auch seine suzuki gsv r wurde nicht besch digt
4791271 denn ich dachte ich sei wirklich gut dabei aber dann kam der sturz dadurch verpasste ich die beste zeit auf der strecke bevor es noch nasser wurde ich habe lange an der box gewartet und dann noch einen anderen hinterreifen ausprobieren aber eine verbesserung war nicht mehr drin nun hoffe ich auf trockenes wetter dann ist noch einiges f r mich drin
4791272 denn wir h tten mit beiden fahrern ein bisschen weiter vorne stehen k nnen wenn wir nur die bedingungen etwas g nstiger erwischt h tten f r morgen w nscht sich jeder ein trockenrennen so auch wir angesichts der trainingsleistung von gestern glauben wir an ein solides resultat beide fahrer haben die chance auf einen podestplatz

4791280 if the speaker is mad the listener should be mindful
4791281 i am not consumed by personal ambition i will not be devastated if i dont do it
4791282 i approached it from a standpoint of kind of a marriage you know if one side of the marriage has to be really talked into the marriage you know it probably aint going to be a good deal for either one of them but if you mutually think that this is a good thing in this case you think its a good thing for the country then you have an opportunity to do some wonderful things together
4791283 im offering myself up im saying that i have the background and capability and the concern to do this
4791284 i and my family have made sacrifices for me to be sitting here today i havent had any income for a long time because im doing this
4791285 i guess a man would have to be a total fool to do all those things and to be leaving his family which is not a joyful thing at all if he didnt want to do it
4791286 nowadays its all about fire in the belly im not sure in the world we live in today its a terribly good thing that a president has too much fire in his belly
4791287 i like to say that im only consumed by very very few things and politics is not one of them the welfare of my country and my kids and grandkids are one of them
4791288 but if people really want in their president a super type a personality someone who has gotten up every morning and gone to bed every night thinking about for years how they could achieve presidency of the united states someone who could look you straight in the eye and say they enjoy every minute of campaigning i aint that guy
4791289 i go out of my way to be myself cause i dont want anybody to think theyre getting something theyre not getting im not consumed by this process im not consumed with the notion of being president im simply saying im willing to do whats necessary to achieve it if im in synch with the people and if the people want me or somebody like me
4791290 its almost refreshing to see that kind of response as opposed to what we get normally
4791291 i think theres a passion there i think that its an old fashioned passion
4791292 i understand my friend john edwards is in town hes over at the library i hope he learns something while hes over there

4791300 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

4791312 this was a vicious and frightening attack on two well respected people who were enjoying a quiet night at home
4791313 the reason for this incident is not yet clear but it was obvious they meant to terrify and intimidate
4791314 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
4791315 after my first tour in iraq i went back home to the states and all my friends called me a murderer and killer i guess i started thinking a lot about all the things i had done over here you know
4791316 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4791317 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4791318 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4791319 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4791320 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4791321 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4791322 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4791323 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4791324 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4791325 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
4791326 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

4791344 were just going to help each other all day and all night
4791345 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4791346 my response simply was did you really just ask me that
4791347 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4791348 my response simply was did you really just ask me that
4791349 at the start of the qualifying it was drier and this is when i was in the garage trying to improve the bike with my team i missed my chance and this is when the others set their fastest laps
4791350 i have had days almost as bad as this before but i have to say that the fault is not all mine
4791351 i think that it is evident at the moment that our tyres are not working as they should
4791352 i am a professional however and i have to wait and have confidence in michelin to find the right way forward
4791353 dani rode very sensibly today the big thing is that he didnt fall
4791354 it is always easy to fall in the rain so he was riding a little more conservatively than usual because he didnt want to risk further damage to his left hand and wrist
4791355 i wore a heavier strapping on my left hand today for better support but anyway the cold weather gave me more pain
4791356 the track was very wet this afternoon i tried to improve my lap time even though the rain got heavier but i couldnt improve so i will start the race from the fourth row
4791357 of course im not happy about starting from there because it wont help us in the race if the race is run in the dry i hope we will have a dry warm up so that we can work on our suspension set up and tyre choice if it is dry in the morning we will work hard to make improvements so we can have the best possible race
4791358 to be honest id felt i was a little bit too far back
4791359 but now i would definitely think about changing my schedule because i was going to take next week off
4791360 in terms of deciphering the nature of a emotion and nexting that emotion i do have a bit of a concern
4791361 everyone in one point in time has experienced difficulty communicating with people due to cultural differences
4791362 a certain gravity to the readings when the overall goal of the thought process is no superficial or cultural separations
4791363 im not sure about chapter 11 either because the focus is on cultural differences and although we all do have cultural differences i believe we changed our words so that it would be a more universal line of communication from my memory we didnt really discuss much cultural difference other than it should be respected
4791364 intercultural communication difference resolution is more and more a pertinent topic in this day and age there are simply more pressing issues at hand that should be covered before this topic
4791365 the only chapter i feel that has any relevance to where we are at is chapter 12
4791366 seem s like there was more dialogue in the beginning of the class
4791367 be ing able to communicate with each with out having some type of argument
4791368 our class particularly myself and my group has some significant
4791369 what we have learned so far listening nexting inhaling exhaling consequentiality assertiveness self disclosure tensionality letting others happen to you standing your own ground none of it has covered what we should do when we encounter interpersonal communication conflicts
4791370 we should read this chapter because it is about conflict management which is something i have been learning throughout the class by being more conscious of what i exhale and inhale and why
4791371 there is no place for hostility in our class and therefore conflicts with the goal of defeat or hurt are not prevalent it is all productive conflict for this project from deciding on a topic to organizing individual work and finally right down to determining a team representative to compile the project for everyone

4791434 over the past 18 months we have seen time and again in iraq that security is sustainable with support and service from the people
4791435 part of the success of the partnership between iraqi and coalition forces has been our ability to live close to the people and provide them with immediate and urgent help
4791436 indeed the success in diyala has been heavily driven by the local populace rejecting the violence of al qaida in iraqs ideology supporting the enforcement of law and the mutual collaboration between the people in diyala province and the iraqi security forces
4791437 we visited the people of diyala and the local authorities to discuss the security situation reconstruction and reconciliation
4791438 during the visit the delegation assembled the immediate and long term needs of the people and began discussions on how the government can best use the 100 million allocated to meet the needs of the people
4791439 so as people in diyala assist security forces in rooting out terrorists and criminals in their neighborhoods the government is helping people by allocating funds to restore services and creating opportunities for the people to improve their lives
4791440 just as security improvements have taken time and sacrifice so will the improvements in services and economic development

4791496 its an opportunity in work clothes weve got to work together and stick together
4791497 youve got to have a bit of luck to win any football match sometimes a little bit more at old trafford but its an opportunity for us to put that record straight and put that stat behind us
4791498 weve got to look forward now weve just got to say this is where we are now its no good looking back
4791499 weve got to make our own luck weve got a chance to take this club forward we finished 12th last year and that was disappointing for this club

4791506 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4791507 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4791508 we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues

4791583 but if you expected the story all along then whats the point of it what could i offer you that you had not already taken and actually i thought there was something rather pretty about it my grandmother once in her life gives in to a frivolous notion and finds herself rudely reminded that dreams are dreams and life is life and the two do not meet you see my grandmother was an enormously practical lady she lived through two world wars after all its this practicality of hers that gives the story a kind of wistfulness at least to my mind and imagine anyway what if she had won what then what would she have started believing in next but you see to understand why my story is correct why it should be told historically as i have told it a point broken off within history rather than the ahistorical the uncanny way that you would prefer you would need to know a hundred things i havent told you even as my grandmother knew a hundred things and was moved by a hundred things unknown to me so that really im as powerless before her story as you are before mine anyway my grandmother is dead and lewes racecourse closed in 1963 my story needs neither of these additional details yet they show how little everything is fixed throw them in and already you can hear them rattling away changing things smearing things getting in the way of things its even easy as we are now in the place to which weve worked ourselves this minute to believe that the past is completely different and what happens there or what will happen there arises or will arise from thoughts and feelings and arcana we cannot imagine or comprehend and so nothing not even truth can ever tumble out quite right

4791667 and the thing that we found is that michael phelps is able to use his body in a way that is very very different from the other athletes and also seems to be much closer to dolphins than we have seen for any other swimmer

4791715 the basic initial point which i made to the bolivians was that effective military effort was dependent on many interrelated factors all of which had to be considered together
4791716 on the specific subjects they metidned we took the following positions
4791717 this latter point illustrates the magnitude of our task at the higher level it was impossible to shake them from their conviction that merely handing them a new weapon with a hight volume of fire would make their soldiers eight feet tall from the morale boost alone
4791718 by a regulary constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized people
4791719 we and the bolivian government both view the guerrilla problem as a bolivian problem thought we recognize that avaible evidence indicates it is a foreign inspired movement led in party by non bolivians and that many of the guerrillas are hard core professionals trainned abroad

4791738 anfang bis mitte der 90er jahre liegt der wirkliche fehler es gab damals keinen kontrollierten zuzug damals hat die sp zugelassen was die gr nen bis heute verlangen seitdem hat sich aber eine menge getan und eine menge ver ndert bereits werner faymann hat damit begonnen integrationsma nahmen in den ffentlichen wohnbauten zu f rdern dazu kommt die integration am arbeitsplatz wer legal hier lebt soll legal hier arbeiten d rfen es ist aber auch im interesse der legal hier lebenden zuwanderer dass rechtskr ftig verurteilte asylwerber abzuschieben sind

4791750 unfortunately i was obstructed by two two slower cars at the beginning of the qualifying this cost me six seven tenths but i m looking forward to tomorrow we ve got a very good car for the race from position four we can again make it onto the podium
4791751 in qualifying i lost seven tenths of a second in the last turn behind a porsche that cost us third place on the grid but the bigger problem is the fact that for two days the front wheels of our car have been locking while braking we ve definitely got to solve this problem before the race
4791752 after our fond memories of le mans the qualifying result is of course a bit disappointing we ve got difficulties coming up with good balance here the car doesn t absorb the bumps well enough we ve still got a lot of work to do
4791753 that the two peugeots are in front comes as no surprise and neither does the gap but that the aston martin lola is in front of us as well is a bit of a blemish but our two cars got stuck in traffic on fresh tyres when they finally had a free lap the tyres were already less than perfect in a 1000 kilometre race grid positions four and five are really not that bad though we re going to correct that tomorrow

4791763 in 1932 johns hopkins university played a team from canada in front of 80 000 spectators which appears to still be a lacrosse record
4791764 there were 80 000 people in the stands all right but they were there for the marathon the marathon was about to finish the same afternoon in the same stadium and the crowd was there to see that and there we were out on the field playing lacrosse against canada
4791765 canada was the only other team there we played three games with them we won the first and third lost the second

4791767 we went to california by train it took three days but we had a good time in the club car our coach ray van orman was a great conditioner so none of us drank we went to a party at the home of a hollywood director who was married to francis x bushmans daughter we visited the mgm lot and watched them shoot a scene with jean harlow
4791768 the crowds we played before in the olympics are my greatest memory
4791769 its true that when we had 105 000 in the stands the people were there for the marathon but for the other two games we played i believe there were 50 000 people there that was impressive
4791770 we went out on the train i had an upper berth it was a lot of fun jack turnbull was the backbone of our team he was a no 1 as good as anybody who ever played

4791787 but also i have a family and bills to pay so this is my job i made the choice a while ago that i wanted to make playing music what i do so there is no room for me to slow down
4791788 if were going out on the road i usually find someone to fill in for me with the other bands
4791789 with pomeroy we are usually actually out on the road so that takes more of a commitment but everyone in all my bands knows that they should go for whatever is going to get them the farthest
4791790 a few years ago i was thinking about forming a cover band
4791791 i had been in a 70s cover band and there was already a band the zeros doing 80s covers but there was nobody really doing only 90s songs that i knew of and weve been sticklers about that the songs cant come from 1989 or 2000 it has to be from 90 to 99 we will go to wikipedia to check the dates on some songs
4791792 we started playing that one right out of the gate so weve played that a lot
4791793 and i really dont know i hate to sound like its all about money but as i get older is about taking care of my family and paying my bills and making a living but that doesnt mean that i dont want to go as far as music can take me

4791872 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4791899 niemand kon het geloven dat peaches faris badwan haar ex uitnodigde van zodra ze terug thuis was laat staan dat ze hem bij haar thuis de nacht zou laten doorbrengen
4791900 ze waren kort voor ze naar las vegas vertrok nog een koppel dan trouwt ze zonder aankondiging met een ander komt ze terug en belt ze hem op alsof dat de normaalste zaak van de wereld is ze leeft in een luchtbel en is dol op de aandacht die ze krijgt maar nu ze getrouwd is wordt het tijd dat ze volwassen wordt
4791901 faris wist dat peaches voor haar werk naar de vs ging maar nu voelt hij zich belazerd hij wil er het fijne van weten
4791902 ik voelde me nochtans goed vanavond maar mijn benen deden niet wat ik wilde ik kon niet versnellen ik ben ontgoocheld over mijn prestatie usain bolt was echt ongenaakbaar vandaag hij is fenomenaal hij is de beste sprinter ooit
4791903 hier heb ik het ganse seizoen hard voor gewerkt ik ben erg tevreden voor mezelf maar ook voor mijn land ik ben enorm fier op wat ik hier heb gepresteerd de tijd kon met eigenlijk niet schelen het enige wat telde was winnen toen ik na 50 meter zag dat ik ging winnen ben ik meteen beginnen vieren ik zei tegen mezelf je gaat winnen en toen heb ik gewoon uitgelopen

4791919 a lot of people expect me to ask softball questions
4791920 they will not be softball they will be fair in fact im going to ask the identical questions to both candidates we flipped a coin and obama goes first for one hour and then john mccain will be in a cone of silence for an hour
4791921 i will ask the identical questions to john mccain so theres no bias theres no gotcha on one and not on the other no well he was too hard or too soft the identical questions and we call it a civil forum because i think you can disagree without being disagreeable without demonizing the opposition
4791922 working on this for about a month questions that dont have any wiggle room so that people just cant go into the well
4791923 what did you think of that when that was playing out
4791924 well i think theres a fundamental difference because evangelicalism and mormonism
4791925 theres no doubt about it and theres some things that mormons hold to that are not historic christianity that all lutherans all methodists all baptists all pentecostals all catholics protestants hold true
4791926 for instance all christians believe in the trinity mormons deny the trinity so thats a fundamental difference
4791927 all christians believe in the old testament and the new testament mormons believe in additional books that historic orthodox christians reject there may have been a misunderstanding on that but i dont even think thats the whole issue i think that there are other issues involved in terms of who has had experience who has had leadership and who understands my problems
4791928 it says he served gods purpose for his generation and then he died and thats my life verse he did serve gods purpose that which never changes but he did it in his generation he did it in a contemporary and relevant way he did the timeless in a timely way he did that which never changed in a world thats constantly changing and thats all that any of us can do my goal is to serve gods purpose in my generation and then ill die then the next guy will serve gods purpose in his generation and i believe god has a purpose for every life and if youre alive if your hearts beating god has a purpose for your life god has never done anything without a purpose
4791929 for many people chinas performance here is something of an eye opener
4791930 coming into the games we felt china should be viewed as the favorite not only because its competing at home but also because of the significant investment being made in developing what will ultimately be one of the most sophisticated sports systems ever built
4791931 having her coach for america is an honor for china
4791932 its a different era from the cold war its globalization people are more open and chinese mindsets have changed too
4791933 the war for gold medals is raging at the beijing olympics and the americans are losing
4791934 this olympic games has seen the most world records broken and has the highest television audience turning it into a leader of happy good times

4791940 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4791941 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4791942 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4791943 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4791944 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4791945 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4791946 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4791947 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4791948 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4791949 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4791950 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4791951 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4791952 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4791953 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4791954 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4791955 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4791956 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4791957 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4791958 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4791959 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4791960 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4791961 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4791962 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4791963 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4791964 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4791965 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4791966 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4791967 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4791968 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4791969 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4791970 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4791971 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4791972 this is a planning took where all things are going
4791973 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4791974 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4791975 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4791976 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4791977 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4791978 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4791979 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4791980 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4791981 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4791982 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4791983 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4791984 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4791985 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4791986 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4791987 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4791988 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4791989 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4791990 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4791991 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4791992 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4791993 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4791994 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4791995 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4791996 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4791997 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4791998 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4791999 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4792000 left alone prices will continue to rise and families are going to be priced out of cable television
4792001 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4792002 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4792003 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4792004 es waren gute leute dabei ich musste einiges bringen um zu siegen
4792005 ich bin sehr entt uscht ich war nicht bei hundert prozent mir haben training und wettkampfpraxis gefehlt
4792006 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4792007 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4792008 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4792009 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4792010 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4792011 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4792012 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4792013 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4792014 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4792015 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4792016 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4792017 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4792018 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4792019 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4792020 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4792021 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4792022 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4792023 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4792024 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4792025 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4792026 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4792027 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4792028 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4792029 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4792030 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4792031 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4792032 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4792033 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4792034 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4792035 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4792036 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4792037 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4792038 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4792039 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4792040 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4792041 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4792042 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4792043 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4792044 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4792045 if we are a lock i think things change at that point if we lock in until then we want top fives we want the momentum of running up front more seat time more pit stops that whole energy and that pressure that comes with racing for wins we want to be in that every day i feel that we have made a lot of ground from the start of the season until now i think we are where we need to be
4792046 yes and no the thing over the years is ive been comfortable with is just doing what i can do i cant change the stats i cant change luck or what goes on at the track in 05 when everything went like it did we were so close again and lost the championship i just really found some comfort in doing all that i could if the team did all that they could and i did all that i could thats it there is nothing else you can do and we did that in 06 and we won we did it again in 07 and we won
4792047 i really feel if where we are as a team or where my talents are as a driver pit stops the crew chiefing if we do our jobs well have a chance
4792048 and thats all you can ask for luck and all those other things you cant lose sleep over it i will im saying this now too because were not in the middle of the chase but as time goes on im doing a better job at worrying about the right things winning three in a row would be great but im going to try not to worry about it yet
4792049 cheating the bad things good nascar nextel cup racers do in pursuit of speed
4792050 the problem is just by getting this point it works out if everything works out perfect that what we have to do
4792051 but thats not including a bad start or running off the track or getting tangled up with somebody if its that close its not worth even thinking about
4792052 weve still got to try to race and get wins its going to be tough these are not the two worst tracks for me but i havent excelled here in the past so ive got to try to ride hard and win races i think weve stepped up here a little bit from the last two years but we dont know if its enough yet well just ride as good as we can
4792053 we went out on some race set up and did some laps got going okay and mat threw down a really good time and then when i saw that i just took a really deep breath i was like all right weve got to go for this one
4792054 just because we squeaked him out that was a heck of lap he did because thats all i had to do was that lap and it was a pretty good one it worked out today and it obviously looks like mat has some real good pace on race tires and i think were pretty close and right there with him hopefully it will turn out to be a good race
4792055 i think there is a mood in the country that just wants the business broken up
4792056 we will fully support the break up frankly it is about time monopolies do not help consumers ever it was almost as if baa had won the lottery without doing anything they have been in a position where essentially they could control how we travel
4792057 it may make sense because airlines know how to deliver to consumers
4792058 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4792059 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4792060 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4792061 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4792062 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is not 1968
4792063 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con ive ever seen in my professional career
4792064 as prosecutors we need more than a photo and a fading memory to walk into court and amend a complaint
4792065 the fbis fingerprint technicians brought science to bear where mere suspicion had prevailed
4792066 it was the most ridiculous press conference ever the familys already identified him
4792067 what you dont know wont hurt you but make you a fool
4792068 dont know that you are lied wont hurt you but make you a fool
4792069 but i do want to know how they handle a crisis because a lot of the things in the presidency often deal with things you dont know are going to happen that we dont know will happen in the next four years there are a lot of different things you can deal with in the life of a leader that will tell us more about the candidate than some of the typical questions
4792070 i can tell you this theyre not a monolithic bloc as the press frequently tries to make them out to be i think that for many evangelicals theyre not convinced that either of these men is an evangelical they may be believers in christ they may be christian but they want to know for instance their worldview and they want to hear it out
4792071 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4792072 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4792073 a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
4792074 we agree with the mediation but we dont think that people who are in these negotiations should be attending as if they have won an election
4792075 lo que nunca querr a es que le quitaran la medalla para d rmela a m porque es un compa ero y un amigo adem s no creo que haya ninguna raz n y si hubiera tenido algo antirreglamentario no le hubieran dejado salir en pek n es un problema que ni me planteo

4792080 la percepci n que nosotros tenemos es que el incremento que hemos tenido no justificar a un incremento de precios en ning n producto

4792084 you may have noticed a significant number of products on the apmex
4792085 when the price of silver or other precious metals drops to a low position everyone who has been waiting to purchase comes in and buys
4792086 this is basic supply and demand this effect is felt across the marketplace from suppliers to dealers to the investors
4792087 silver buyers overwhelmed retailers during the third week of march when silver was trading above 20 oz
4792088 were running out of metals and silver in small quantities is extremely difficult to find right now the largest demand is for silver rounds and for small 100 oz or less silver bars

4792095 nosso time no meu ponto de vista tem voado tamb m tem cumprido muito bem as fun es dentro de campo e as caracter sticas
4792096 vai ser um grande jogo e a gente espera que o torcedor nos ajude
4792097 um ataque veloz um meio de campo din mico que joga muito que p e a bola no ch o o cruzeiro tem sido identificado nos ltimos anos como uma equipe de muita velocidade e de muita t cnica ent o n o f cil dentro do mineir o enfrentar uma equipe assim
4792098 o vit ria evoluiu bastante ao longo do campeonato e era uma equipe que para muitos iria brigar para n o cair j que veio de um acesso por m o grupo mostrou que tem for a e fez um excelente trabalho
4792099 muito dif cil uma equipe liderar desde a primeira rodada e manter sempre o mesmo n vel mas fizemos um bom jogo diante do ava e isso o que estamos procurando tentaremos manter o n vel contra o am rica
4792100 dificilmente uma equipe come ar um campeonato 100 e terminar da mesma forma vamos trabalhar duro pois na hora certa a seq ncia de vit rias voltar como foi no in cio da competi o

4792110 no unless you make a license agreement with the copyright holders or their agents
4792111 i havent felt good physically but i persevered and did a lot of training to win this gold tenacity was the key
4792112 indonesias yulianti defeated lu lan of china 11 21 21 13 21 15 for the singles bronze medal
4792113 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4792114 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4792115 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4792116 mike and bob bryan of the united states won the bronze medal in doubles the brothers rallied to defeat michael llodra and arnaud clement of france 3 6 6 3 6 4 saturday
4792117 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4792118 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4792119 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4792120 and there will be a next time the sisters said both plan to play at the london olympics in 2012
4792121 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4792122 new york politicians use motor vehicle traffic laws as a multi faceted way to tax new york drivers which of course creates further incentive for motorists to fight their tickets
4792123 the police have fewer targets to ticket and therefore need to squeeze more money out of each victim courts have no discretion to waive or reduce the surcharge and often the surcharge exceeds the actual fine amount for the traffic ticket
4792124 my clients wish that they hadnt had to bring this lawsuit they would have greatly preferred to be working inside the justice department where by all rights they deserved to be defending the government in court rather than standing as victimized examples of government wrongdoing
4792125 reveal defendant department of justices utterly unredeemable obliviousness to its legal obligations and its remarkably recidivistic failures to meet them in the first place
4792126 this was an extraordinary and uniquely successful conspiracy to achieve political results that required the gross deprivation of hundreds of individuals constitutional rights for which defendant gonzales was legally most responsible
4792127 we have no idea why the six plaintiffs in this case were not selected for the departments extraordinarily competitive honors program and summer law intern programs except that it had nothing to do with monica goodling a fact that the evidence will bear out in court
4792128 from the initial checkup i say that none of the babies have any sort of deformities or incomplete organs
4792129 we thought about an abortion but then we felt its religiously forbidden
4792130 when it is resolved i mean the underlying conflict it must be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of georgia
4792131 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4792132 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4792133 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4792134 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4792135 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4792136 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done but i would just note there are already consequences there have been universal concern within the eu the united states about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4792137 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4792138 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4792139 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4792140 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4792141 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4792142 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4792143 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4792144 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

4792153 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4792154 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question

4792224 im very happy for the players it was a difficult game psychologically we played at home and had to win
4792225 i know that the next game we will play without pressure the main thing is to get a good rest
4792226 technically we feel more confident before we were losing by 20 or 30 points each match but its much better now
4792227 we fought hard to the end now we need to keep pushing ahead
4792228 they were just a little bit better defensively than we were and they made the big shots
4792229 ryan has been bothered by this condition in his foot for some time
4792230 he consulted with a number of specialists in an effort to correct the problem without surgery but it was ultimately determined that surgery was the best path to take for his general well being and for his career
4792231 obviously he will miss the start of the 2008 09 season but the doctors tell us he will be able to play pain free when he returns to the lineup this season
4792232 we were able to accommodate our afl and olympic games commitments especially with coverage of port adelaides match in adelaide
4792233 several months ago sa football fans expressed concern the olympics would rule out football coverage we covered all key events in the olympics last night

4792236 new york politicians use motor vehicle traffic laws as a multi faceted way to tax new york drivers which of course creates further incentive for motorists to fight their tickets
4792237 the police have fewer targets to ticket and therefore need to squeeze more money out of each victim courts have no discretion to waive or reduce the surcharge and often the surcharge exceeds the actual fine amount for the traffic ticket

4792241 you come back here and the job market is flooded you find yourself flipping big macs wondering where your prestige went
4792242 americans have not stopped going out to eat and arent going to stop but they are being forced to decide
4792243 their discretionary income pool is smaller so if a restaurant isnt on their personal a or b list they will drop it
4792244 the restaurant industry is overstored especially in casual dining with demand nowhere near the increased supply of stores over the past five years
4792245 the companies could get the money so they opened up the stores
4792246 these stocks are very very very cheap because their fundamentals keep getting a little worse
4792247 but if you have a time horizon of two or more years at some point theyre going to have a big big recovery
4792248 we could be close to a bottom for the restaurant stocks though the businesses themselves will continue to have a tough time the rest of this year and into 2009
4792249 yet a lot of the higher quality companies with strong brands balance sheets and management teams will survive and be well positioned when the economy turns around
4792250 many of the independent restaurants which are locally owned and operated have managed to do just fine in the current environment
4792251 they arent big and dont have a lot of marketing muscle but they are able to compete with the things they can control like service and commitment to customer satisfaction
4792252 im just ready to go there and have fun and thats what im going to do tibbs said during an aug
4792253 and i really cant wait to go out there and represent the united states the united states navy as well and the whole military
4792254 and thats what i tell them at the beginning because sometimes they can hear it from a doctor they can hear it from their family but when they hear it from somebody who has actually sat in a hospital bed and gone from a hospital bed to an olympic podium it gives them a lot more hope
4792255 i remember doing it and it was probably the hardest run ive ever done in my life
4792256 but after that day i was able to progress a lot more and now i can run 400 meters in 53 seconds
4792257 i stayed on active duty and went to the games in 2004 i won a gold medal and a silver medal a gold medal in the 4 x 100 relay and a silver in the mens pentathlon setting a new american record
4792258 i then went to 2006 world championships i won my first gold medal in the individual pentathlon and now ive qualified for the 2008 games where im going to be competing in the pentathlon the 200 meters the long jump and the 400 meters and hopefully the relay again
4792259 the whole olympic dream really didnt start until after i lost my leg
4792260 i was 22 years old or 23 when i started thinking hey i could go to the paralympic games thats really when my dream started
4792261 he ran 1 41 in the 800 meters and hes one of three people to ever do that in history of all sports period

4792263 its about just getting back to your life and competing in sports and just playing sports

4792265 today i was supposed to be getting a medal for my grandfather
4792266 i guarantee if he was still alive i would call him and tell him what happened today and he would probably say well i won my bowling tournament whether he did it or not i think about that he wanted me to know one of us was winning so i still owe him
4792267 i just came out and tried to work a few things and it worked out
4792268 hes gotten a whole lot better i think even bigger and stronger his wrist is like the size of vcr tapes
4792269 a lot of honor is in your heart when youre wrestling in front of your people you want to give them a medal because sometimes there are people out there who deserve it more than you my hats off to him thats a tough loss for him and his home crowd he brought it he was really trying hard i was just able to hold him off
4792270 he came out real fast so i was ready for it
4792271 i got out there and saw that he was feeling it just as much as i was and my offense wasnt working for me in the end like when i really needed to i tried to hit that gut wrench as many times as i could and it didnt pan out
4792272 thats my go to move and it wasnt there for me
4792273 my lift i wasnt able to get off on him hindsight is always 20 20 looking back i know for a fact i should have been doing a whole lot more on my feet
4792274 i already know coach army staff sgt shon lewis is going to say that right off the top
4792275 i missed a couple of key opportunities to score on my feet and ill never get em back and this is not the place where you should walk around saying anything like that
4792276 in competitions like this youre looking to see your soul out there gasping on the mat for air and it didnt happen today
4792277 i walked off i wasnt tired i was like man if im not tired then i didnt do everything i shouldve done
4792278 usually we say you get back to the hotel room and your mirror will be the most honest thing youll ever see
4792279 i dont even have to make it that far to know i dropped the ball today and i apologize to anybody i let down theres more fight in me theres a whole lot more fight in me and im going to have to make sure thats shown the next competitions the next major ones the next olympics
4792280 if these rules were something that started last week i would probably have a whole lot to say about it but ive won some matches the same way
4792281 its something we know its an occupational hazard i guess but we accept it the way it is
4792282 greco roman wrestling regardless of the rules and what changes they make when it boils down its wrestling
4792283 and if you dont go out there and wrestle head down then you get no anthem no flag thats the way it is
4792284 theres something in us that makes us keep going it might be just drive determination american spirit me and my background soldiering i dont know but theres just something in here that says its never time to quit weve got something we can accomplish here so were going to hit it hard these next four years and do everything we have to do
4792285 honestly its a lot smaller tournament than what i thought
4792286 and i couldve brought a whole lot bigger fight im kicking myself for that
4792287 i think there was times when i was holding back
4792288 i always joke that i can outrun anybody on a treadmill i dont have to think when im on a treadmill but if im outside running i forget what im doing but on the treadmill im a heavyweight king running a marathon sometimes it happens in wrestling ill be out there and my mind will wander
4792289 people are very friendly architecture is amazing the great wall experience was awesome
4792290 you cant put a cap on the fight in an americans heart
4792291 were just craving another chance now this is just fuel for something bigger and the only thing bigger is the next olympics

4792380 on average the gross domestic products in sub saharan africa have grown between six and seven percent in the past three years and the number of democracies has more than doubled since 1999 the resultant effect is that these countries offer exceptional opportunities for investors
4792381 we will not invest in farms but rather in the processing and marketing of farming outputs such as food certain beverages and fibre products by following the route of expanding the industry it will ultimately create new growth opportunities for existing and emerging farmers in addition mandate includes investment into ecotourism in the context of integrated rural development
4792382 agribusiness is an important contributor to economic growth in the region and is poised for significant expansion given the significant lack of equity risk capital to finance agribusiness transactions the dbsas participation in this fund allows it to play a catalytic role in developing financial infrastructure to provide access to much needed long term risk capital in this critical sector
4792383 i believe that several countries on the continent have comparative advantages in agriculture which provide a logical base for economic growth
4792384 the fund contributes risk capital and management know how to fully unlock the potential of businesses
4792385 over and above the opportunities associated with the prevailing global food and commodities cycle there is growing demand globally for various african exports such as organically grown vegetables fruit and flowers processed natural fibre for industrial applications as well as natural supplements and health products
4792386 agri vie aims to be a catalyst to unlock this potential to the advantage of the enterprises concerned their host communities and the funds investors agri vie believes that sustainable development is best brought about by the disciplines of investment rather than aid grants
4792387 our involvement was partly spurred by the financial sector charter which designates agri as an area of targeted investment both sanlam private equity and strategy partners truly believe in the business and investment potential of agribusiness in south africa and on the continent and are delighted to be playing a role in realising it the south african portion of the fund was started with the express purpose of empowering agri businesses and playing a key catalyst role for bee in the agribusiness sector
4792388 women are far behind with regard to participation as owners and managers in agribusiness through agri vie we intend to make a meaningful contribution to empowering women in this sector

4792392 why do all these people want to speak to me
4792393 i was miss nobody and nobody wanted to speak to me and now its overwhelming that everybody does
4792394 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4792395 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4792396 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4792397 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there

4792440 shes my old girlfriend i understand she started drinking right after we split up many years ago and i hear she hasnt been sober since
4792441 who would think that a person could go on celebrating that long
4792442 la concentrazione verte sulla espirazione che deve essere lunga e profonda cos l aria viziata residua espulsa dai polmoni ed il praticante pu utilizzare a pieno la sua capacit polmonare di conseguenza il ritmo respiratorio rallenta come il ritmo cardiaco il sangue e gli organi interni sono meglio ossigenati
4792443 what are you holding back for theres nothing to hold back for i trained my butt off forever im just gonna let it go

4792447 to the public keep these firefighters in your prayers the fire season has a way to go even as we are sitting here today there are battles raging in the forest
4792448 i know in my heart all his friends who died with him were living their prayer
4792449 but for the way they had lived they were pretty jazzed and happy because they held the lines and they loved helicopter rides
4792450 you had the extraordinary gift of having these men in your lives
4792451 perhaps their gift will be saving the life of a future firefighter or helicopter pilot
4792452 sometimes you are sitting on a ridge top and you look to the east and you see that sun coming up
4792453 and you sit there with 20 men and women whom you really like and a couple you might hate their guts but you sit there with those 20 folks and youve got these moments of silence and you see the sun come up in the east and you tell yourself its going to get better we are survivors we will do what we need to do to carry on

4792455 mark schauer will do anything to distract from his opposition to drilling for more american oil and his vote for the largest tax increase in michigan history
4792456 liberal special interest groups supporting mark schauer have been attacking congressman walberg with robocalls radio and tv ads for over a year and we will gladly join in condemning the attacks of mark schauers liberal anti drilling washington d c friends
4792457 you just cant do something like that with web based technologies
4792458 lets focus on this one thing she said while people were treating her like garbage
4792459 was recording studios without any room reverb or ambience the playing room at windmill lane studios was designed to be totally dead and you can hear it on the drums it wasnt until the boy sessions that we figured out that we had to pull the drum kit into the entrance hall after the receptionist had gone home to get a decent drum sound with its three story stairwell and stone and tiled surfaces it was a great live room
4792460 its been an eventful day and so many things happen you just try and block it all out and focus on your ride and focus on your performance and thats what i did and to finish with one two on the podium thats just unbelievable
4792461 you have to stay focused and not get overexcited by it all we expected it was possible with the kind of form everyone has had and now the standard in the team is such that if you get in the team youre going to be a realistic medal chance thats just the way it is
4792462 but if you get too excited you watch someone like bradley going up to the podium right before the keirin final i didnt look at him or the flag i didnt want to look at the emotion on his face because i knew that would set me off
4792463 i was just trying to show a little bit of respect by standing up when the ceremony was on but i was trying to block it out of my mind as much as possible because again its about the process of the performance
4792464 this is a shot in the arm for those of us doing music not in the twin cities
4792465 i wrote at the shore so the piece is infused with the feeling of the region
4792466 minneapolis has been my home for over 20 years i wanted to be a part of the sesquicentennial
4792467 it was great for the kids to work with a living composer
4792468 they were so full of joy at the end the reward was huge
4792469 its a whimsical piece that tries to characterize the many cultural communities that have come to make a home in minnesota
4792470 i have already talked to my board about looking into commissioning more
4792471 the application process gave me the chance to review the music of a lot of minnesota composers it gave me ideas for the future
4792472 it is still early days but miley is really interested in the film which follows the story of a lovable lost suburban girl who descends into a life of reckless partying and promiscuity
4792473 if she does get the part you will be seeing a lot more of her than you did in the vanity fair photos there would definitely be nude scenes
4792474 what kind of god would cast his creatures into hell
4792475 as it is written there is none righteous no not one for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god god says that even if you are angry at somebody you have already committed murder because you have become a murderer in your heart same goes for lust and any other sin

4792480 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations

4792491 if style is about personal expression and fashion its vehicle it is certainly the successful blending of the two in which parisian women excel they know who they are and where to get what they need to convey their essence with brio the secret therefore lies in the right mix of personality and product
4792492 for the millions of women who suffer from paris envy chic in paris is a guide to unveiling the french fashion enigma this guide consists of interviews with eight parisian women whom were selected for their undisputed taste in fashion their sense of self that is expressed in their style philosophy and their secret addresses of boutiques couturiers and designers that allows them to pull it all inimitably together
4792493 we came because we wanted to see the progress iraq has made
4792494 it was good to see the successes and what they have planned for the future
4792495 it is very evident that they love their country and want to see democracy succeed
4792496 we must show the world that the al anbar province is a showcase of democracy
4792497 this was one of the most dangerous areas and now it has moved on
4792498 you can see the progress as you walk through the city you see commerce and businesses
4792499 a few of you guys expressed that you would be interested in unethical ways of building traffic or making money online so i figured id post a few here and there
4792500 some of them expressed that they are interested in unethical ways to create traffic or on line money so i was patterned that some here and there now please report that i do not encourage these methods for use at your own risk
4792501 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4792502 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4792503 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4792504 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4792505 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4792506 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4792507 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4792508 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4792509 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4792510 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4792511 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4792512 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4792513 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4792514 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4792515 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4792516 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4792517 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4792518 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4792519 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4792520 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4792521 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4792522 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4792523 it was so slippery out that for every step i took ahead i slipped back two
4792524 a state in which no more can be said or done
4792525 1000 places to see before you die a travelers life list
4792526 pretending to skim magazines while waiting for someone you met on the internet to meet you at the bookstore
4792527 ive been really happy by how nonplussed theyve been by the whole thing
4792528 wow our possible president using a word like nonplussed what a welcome change from dubya and mccain
4792529 we treat each and every detainee in our custody with the same high level of quality professional care possible
4792530 after almost two weeks of suffering with unbearable back pain and unable to get any sleep he was so weak and looked horrible
4792531 he said i told the nursing department im in pain but they dont believe me
4792532 because he could no longer withstand the suffering inside the facility
4792533 rather obstructions were created by the vajyapee government to ensure that punjab did not get anything
4792534 the education in state is being funded through sarv sikhisha abhaiyan and furthermore the funds in jnnurm are available but punjab government has failed to avail its benefit because of non submission of requisite project schemes as mandatory in the mission
4792535 likewise during the annual budget finance minister gives grants to punjab agricultural university because pau acts as a nodal institution for agricultural related research and other works
4792536 still pm has never adopted any kind of approach to marginalise punjab he wants prosperity for each and every single state and not just congress ruled states
4792537 buying 3 or fewer houses checkout in lane 10 please
4792538 since the beginning weve been pushing for reform pushing for getting away from the good ole boy system
4792539 weve eliminated the lowest bracket of income taxes we eliminated the sales tax on groceries and thats simply puts more money in the pockets of our consumers which in turn grows our economy had we returned more to the taxpayer than we did than certainly some of our economic problems wouldnt be as great
4792540 weve did meet some of those goals reforming the department of transportation which will make is more efficient
4792541 i was excited to see marriage defined in our constitution
4792542 this simply makes that very difficult choice of a person in a very difficult situation more informed
4792543 the freedom of information process we have now is backwards the taxpayer has to jump through hoops now to get information they paid for to begin with the burden should be on the government to provide that information
4792544 i believe that the accountability alone will save millions of dollars
4792545 i was disappointed that state superintendent of education jim rex was pushing this bill to go through to eliminate pact and start a new test
4792546 i was getting hundreds of e mails and i would respond and tell them the whole story they were only getting half the story
4792547 weve got some incentives to try to push the market in this hydrogen research its a long way down the road but it probably needs to be the direction we need to go towards
4792548 the easiest message is raise taxes dump money into health care and weve never seen that solution work for any problem
4792549 the reality in the position im taking is there needs to be more market based incentives into the health care system
4792550 we passed a bill that allows small businesses to pull together to make a larger group to purchase insurance to make it more affordable
4792551 health savings accounts i think would be utilized much more if we could do a better job explaining to the public how it works
4792552 its administered by an insurance company the money you put into a savings account is tax free and it can only be spent on true medical expenses but it puts the consumer back into the picture
4792553 i have a lot of respect for the way he practices medicine he spoils his customers and he pays them a lot of attention
4792554 iran hopes to make a good use of its advantages in geopolitics energy and religion to expand relations with all sides and build up anti u s strength
4792555 irans diplomatic efforts have achieved some results which partly dispelled pressures from the united states
4792556 they are not an accurate mimic of the processes of human pain

4792558 ditto libby somehow i doubt they would be blowing it off if the games were being held on their home turf and the chinese took a picture of their basketball team with churros hanging from their mouths and ponchos wrapped around their bodies

4792579 the legal draft will be presented to the coalition leaders on sunday or monday and after their approval it will be tabled in parliament next week
4792580 its a very long list and there are so many charges against him and still we had to leave out much he has done so many wrongs in the years he illegally ruled this country
4792581 the leaders might even drop some more charges in the final draft

4792598 demi allah orang seperti anda tidak layak untuk ditolak hanya saja engkau adalah orang kafir sedangkan aku adalah seorang muslimah sehingga tidak halal untuk menikah denganmu jika kamu mau masuk islam maka itulah mahar bagiku dan aku tidak meminta selain dari itu

4792603 he trafficking and rape of children for profit is one of the darkest stories on the planet this physical mental and emotional trauma leaves children broken and scarred for life interventions for these children
4792604 i am certain that such a scenario is not possible in ukraine
4792605 prosperity peace and calm in crimea is the very foundation on which the interests of ukraine and neighboring russia coincide everything else is of secondary importance
4792606 if we complete this stage and go on to the next one we can be confident that there will be no russian or any other destabilization scenario in crimea
4792607 in other words we need to come up with clearer rules that would ensure ukraines national security in such situations

4792612 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4792613 about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4792614 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4792615 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4792616 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4792617 gosh i hate men because they just want to use me for sex

4792638 you cannot negotiate anything about that status if you dont talk about jerusalem final status consists primarily i believe of jerusalem and refugees if you want to postpone jerusalem you postpone refugees really you are not dealing with the problem you have to discuss these issues and that is exactly where the trade off has to be made
4792639 the ideology that fatah has adopted over the last 15 years a two state solution seems to be faltering and with it fatah is faltering so it is time maybe to rethink to bring fatah around to a new idea the old new idea of one state
4792640 hollywood under siege martin scorsese the religious right and the culture wars
4792641 and last temptation was perceived as the most egregious yet
4792642 i think it was perceived as out of sync with religious values and almost deliberately so
4792643 last temptation gave the leaders of the christian movement a target
4792644 and by opposing the film they hoped to rally their membership get a new sense of identity and also rebuild their membership and fundraising
4792645 last temptation from reaching theaters the events of the summer of 1988 continued to reverberate in the culture
4792646 id heard some rumors about this film that was coming out
4792647 and its going to portray jesus as different than he is in the gospels and a lot of people feel its blasphemous
4792648 everyone was appealing to universal not to make this thing that was disrespectful unhistorical
4792649 i just happened to be in the right place right in their backyard with a big audience so i decided to be the bandleader of this thing
4792650 it looked like every other person had a sign too
4792651 my response at the time was well not every day does people magazine call me up and say
4792652 it gave a lot of opportunity to talk about what we believe
4792653 for the first time a lot of people took to the streets and realized that they could and they werent averse to doing it again
4792654 i dont know whether it would turn out the same
4792655 oh gosh ill never forget standing in front of those 30 000 people with all those major christian broadcasters who said theyd stand with me
4792656 none of them did not jan and paul crouch of costa mesa based trinity broadcasting network none of them
4792657 i wonder if i could have done more good if id stayed with mca and worked from the inside
4792658 and i technically didnt mind that i was being used because in my heart of hearts i felt that at least to the world that i would demonstrate that there were things more valuable than silver and gold
4792659 it was a decision then that i was proud of and i was comfortable with
4792660 you think the christians regret being eaten by the lions
4792661 but did they regret standing up for their faith in jesus of course not
4792662 the boycott i think gave more attention to the movie than it deserved and probably made more money for them than it deserved
4792663 i saw the movie or a good portion of it years later and it wasnt that good of a movie just for its entertainment value
4792664 today there is a greater emphasis on the humanizing of jesus making him more human
4792665 there was a time when you would never get asked this question but now i think even among evangelicals you get asked well could jesus have been married
4792666 but back then i think it was such an affront because people did not ask those questions
4792667 its not within the realm of who jesus was and so its not relevant
4792668 its an interesting fiction story just like the da vinci code is an interesting fiction story
4792669 it raises questions for people to ask and gives an opportunity to tell people whats really going on
4792670 if last temptation were released today i dont think anybody would care
4792671 it was a pretty good looking bunch of guys down there playing
4792672 each and every week will be down to the wire were just going to focus on one game at a time
4792673 with the stuff that we can take care of and worry about there isnt any advantage or disadvantage about any ranking as far as the bcs the polls how people vote or how far you fall thats stuff we cant control the stuff that we can control is on the field when you get out on the field there are no rankings

4792675 the effects seen in placebo controlled trials of homoeopathy are compatible with the placebo hypothesis
4792676 the 8 studies i quoted were from a commentary of the paper published by the european committee for homeopathy the information was quoted as being given by individuals who were involved in the study itself
4792677 final 8 you have cited were indeed the original studies that were used to conclude the meta analysis in the light of the lead authors admission of bias and proven lack of transparency i would still treat this information with suspicion however as the information you have quoted was from the authors themselves it was unfair to call your citings incorrect and i apologise
4792678 we only have the word of shang et al that the
4792679 the nature authors briefly refer to the most useful suggestion yet made in the long running concerns over scientific misconduct occasional audits of laboratory records to match up publications with the underlying research knowing that the auditors may drop in unannounced could have a wondrously elevating influence on scientific integrity
4792680 the 8 studies i quoted were from a commentary of the paper published by the european committee for homeopathy the information was quoted as being given by individuals who were involved in the study itself
4792681 he is wrong a replication of the analysis of shang et al would do nicely
4792682 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
4792683 very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp

4792689 rebel against the normal responsibilities of adulthood and demand that a parental government meet their needs from cradle to grave
4792690 rejecting the sovereignty of the individual subordinating him to the will of the government
4792691 based on strikingly irrational beliefs and emotions modern liberals relentlessly undermine the most important principles on which our freedoms were founded
4792692 like spoiled angry children they rebel against the normal responsibilities of adulthood and demand that a parental government meet their needs from cradle to grave
4792693 a social scientist who understands human nature will not dismiss the vital roles of free choice voluntary cooperation and moral integrity as liberals do
4792694 a political leader who understands human nature will not ignore individual differences in talent drive personal appeal and work ethic and then try to impose economic and social equality on the population as liberals do and a legislator who understands human nature will not create an environment of rules which over regulates and over taxes the nations citizens corrupts their character and reduces them to wards of the state as liberals do
4792695 the roots of liberalism and its associated madness can be clearly identified by understanding how children develop from infancy to adulthood and how distorted development produces the irrational beliefs of the liberal mind
4792696 when the modern liberal mind whines about imaginary victims rages against imaginary villains and seeks above all else to run the lives of persons competent to run their own lives the neurosis of the liberal mind becomes painfully obvious

4792727 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside zimbabwe await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations
4792728 we agree with the mediation but we dont think that people who are in these negotiations should be attending as if they have won an election
4792729 the poles should be thanked for helping reveal the strategic goal of the u s missile defense plan
4792730 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information

4792780 the recent referendum shows that the morales government has increased its mandate to a landslide margin by delivering on some of the changes that the electorate had voted for and offering the majority of bolivians a realistic hope for a better future it casts doubt on the claim that this government has simply pursued its own polarizing leftist agenda without regard to the concerns of the broad electorate its victory is all the more impressive in that it has been handicapped by an overwhelmingly hostile bolivian media

4792790 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4792791 about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4792792 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4792793 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4792794 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4792795 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4792796 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4792797 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4792798 you got to love them for that but at the same time its a competitive sport
4792799 we were an awesome race team last year had one of the best years that ive ever had and steve was the guy that was guiding that ship so i believe one hundred percent in him your confidence gets down and a lot of things happen performances arent always there and its the toughest thing to rebound from that and thats kind of the situation were in right now were working really hard we tested this week in kentucky and we just continue to work hard at it
4792800 again even though weve been hit or miss this year i feel like those last ten races are all good tracks for us other than texas texas is a track that has been our achilles heel and were going to work hard to try to fix that when youre looking at a deficit of eighty or ninety points going into it from the way kyle busch has been running this year thats a lot to overcome we know we need some bonus points before we start that chase and all our focus is on is racing hard and trying to get those wins and get the best finishes that we can
4792801 no were not in a position to take a gamble right now were in a tricky position right now because we have one or two bad finishes where we could find ourselves very easily slipping back and not be secure going into richmond we want to be secure going into richmond and so these next couple of weeks if we put good finishes together then we might be in a position to take some more risks i say risks its experimenting with things that youre testing its taking gambles on pit strategy calls those types of things
4792802 i tell you last week impressed the heck out of me what he did in sonoma didnt impress me as much because they hit the caution just right he had the track position last week he beat one of the best there is out there in tony stewart he was solid all day long that shows me what kind of team they have and what kind of driver kyle is they got their momentum back i was saying prior to the race weekend and i wasnt trying to stir anything up i was just pointing out the way that things were going that i felt like they had lost some momentum but they got it all back in a hurry last weekend
4792803 no i meant i dont stomp around and throw things out here laughter i do plenty of that dont worry we handle things the way that i feel like is productive and you dont just turn the other cheek you dont deny whats going on you face it head on everybody handles it professionally and you can only have the type of relationship like steve and i have where we dont take things personally he can criticize me and i can criticize him and we only want to get better and know that hes the leader of this team and im the best tool that he can possibly have to help make the car better and i have a responsibility he has a responsibility and thats where our focus is
4792804 oh im surprised with that stat especially with the slow start to the season weve had creative pit work and those sorts of things to try to keep us out to get those bonus points but here lately weve been up there racing for the win and lead laps a lot of laps so thats helpful but this team is a great race team and well get every point we can every way we can
4792805 i think right now that everybody is focused on what its going to take to win a championship and that includes bonus points i remember a couple of years back maybe it was tony stewart i was racing for the championship and he had a bunch more bonus points and that really helped him out and had him in a comfortable spot heading into homestead so i think we all recognize that and notice that its just a matter of if you get up there and do it
4792806 we probably couldnt be more different than two people than two people on this planet laughs
4792807 one other credit to chad is that i dont think there is anybody in the garage area that works as hard as he does its a bold statement and i dont want to take anything away from the other great crew chiefs and teams that are out there but the guy just never stops working at times this year the workload has been there but we may have been working in the wrong areas and now it seems like were working in the right areas and getting speed out of it
4792808 it sucked we just cant get a grip on this qualifying were just not getting it together were always one way or another we just cant get that balance right it seems like were just going to start in the back like we usually do and have to spend most of the race working our way back to the front
4792809 i dont know were fine in race trim but we just suck in qualifying we were alright in qualifying trim earlier but we just missed a lot when it came to getting it right
4792810 stanley tools along with ace hardware foundation are donating 1 million to the childrens miracle network if were able to win the race this weekend
4792811 weve got 400 miles to run good and try to get stanley tools and ace hardware to donate 1 million
4792812 i have no idea im just focused on each race i want to be back here at red bull next year thats going to be their ultimate decision all i can do is to keep driving until they tell me not to or until they tell me im staying and then well go from there
4792813 it would be nice you know it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4792814 yes but i mean it depends on what side of the fence you are on man if you are on the winning side you are happy dont matter how if you are the guy who had the fastest car all day you arent real happy about it i have been on both sides of it it goes down in the history books however it goes do in there you know everybody would like to just go out there and just out run the hell out of everybody to win races sometimes you have to take them how you get them
4792815 i can say this i dont think the pit stop strategy ruined the race any more than how bad our car was handling or running at that particular part of the race
4792816 he is just a good ole guy you know i wish it was different for him but oh well he is pretty tough and i feel like when it comes down to it he will prove to everybody yea we are human we make mistakes but he is damn sure the guy for the job in my opinion

4792908 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party

4792965 i am vetoing this proposal because it is unfair to raise the vehicle registration fee from 75 to 95 for only city of milwaukee residents at a time when residents are already grappling with increases in food and fuel prices a 26 increase in the vehicle registration fee and a complete elimination of the responsibility of other property owners is not the road to go down
4792966 if milwaukee dramatically increases the number of kids who take the act well no longer be in the number one or two in the country were going to drop if the state of wisconsin wants to be one or two in the act theyre going to have to figure out ways to help milwaukee kids do better

4793066 no me dejaban me tocaban como en un juego de imaginaci n les mov a como una potencia
4793067 el problema de escalero es que no estaba ingresado ni recib a tratamiento
4793068 permanec a en el espacio de la marginaci n fall l pero tambi n el resto de la sociedad la red sociosanitaria no supo prever ni evitar las consecuencias de su locura
4793069 antes de que las diligencias llegaran al juzgado rodr guez men ndez se cruz y se llev el caso de mi vida
4793070 es una de esas experiencias que te agr an el car cter
4793071 la defensa no ten a ninguna dificultad el informe pericial era avasallador
4793072 le voy a decir al juez que voy a ser bueno y que nunca m s beber vino para no hacer cosas tan malas como las que he hecho y que tomar la medicaci n que el m dico me diga
4793073 antes estaban en los manicomios que se cerraron por caros e impopulares los dementes han pasado a la mendicidad muchos recalan en la c rcel sin tratamiento
4793074 las voces siguen se r en de m me dicen que quieren sangre
4793075 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4793076 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4793077 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4793078 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4793079 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4793080 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4793081 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4793082 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4793083 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4793084 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4793085 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4793086 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4793087 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4793088 when you drink alcohol your resistance to everything goes down including your resistance to temptation of fatty foods you tend to eat more when you drink
4793089 this small democracy far away from our shores is an inspiration to all those who cherish our deepest ideals
4793090 can no longer be our partner it would be better if he went
4793091 we worked all night long all morning long as late as 6 30 in the morning where they injected high intense chlorine into the water lines at both schools
4793092 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4793093 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4793094 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4793095 je ne sais pas trop comment je pars mais jai limpresion d tre toujours en retard jai du mal acc l rer et je narrive pas rattraper les filles pourtant javais de meilleures sensations que ce matin
4793096 with republicans fighting relentlessly on behalf of the american people for real energy reform its clear that the democratic leadership has finally recognized this is an issue they cannot ignore
4793097 if the speaker was truly interested in allowing congress to vote on a plan to put our nation on the path to energy independence we would have taken up the american energy act the all of the above plan put forward by congressional republicans instead democrats gave themselves a five week vacation and told the american people they would just have to wait when it comes to energy reform democrats have quite simply failed to lead
4793098 die aufgabe wird f r j rgen klinsmann jetzt nicht einfacher
4793099 wenn man relativ fr h 2 0 f hrt dann muss man das spiel gewinnen egal wie ansonsten sind das zwei verlorene punkte
4793100 gerade die startspiele sind sehr wichtig damit man schon mal luft hat wenn man zu hause gewonnen hat kann man ausw rts unentschieden spielen
4793101 wenn man auch in dortmund nur einen punkt holt hat man am ende vielleicht vier z hler zu wenig auf dem konto
4793102 wir brauchen noch einige zeit um den spielfluss zu entwickeln an dem wir t glich arbeiten
4793103 wir sind doch nicht wahnsinnige die wegen ein zwei drei wochen millionen ausgeben
4793104 in our democratic society the library stands for hope for learning for progress for literacy for self improvement and for civic engagement the library is a symbol of opportunity citizenship equality freedom of speech and freedom of thought and hence is a symbol for democracy itself
4793105 were thrilled to be working with the carnegie corporation of new york and the american library association to honor librarians who play such a vital role in our communities
4793106 what began as a local times initiative in new york city seven years ago has grown to a national awards program and now we are proud to be co presenting the award with the carnegie corporation of new york and the ala
4793107 this award will continue to raise awareness of the valuable contributions of todays librarians and the ways they make a difference in peoples lives and their communities schools and campuses
4793108 we call all residents near the street to clean the areas near their residence adjacent to the street and as soon as the cleaning is finished the street will reopen for traffic and people
4793109 what do i need to convince them that were the best
4793110 what can i my companys product do to contribute to my customers success
4793111 this is taking on the feeling of a coronation rather than a competition
4793112 im just happy to be in the same sentence as those athletes carl lewis mary lou retton jesse owens and mark spitz all those guys are great olympians and they will always be great olympians
4793113 ive never seen a 9 92 look quite that easy
4793114 i am away because i am helping the poor the destitute and all those who are suffering to find peace in my beloved country somalia
4793115 dad you died while serving the poor the suffering and the destitute i know that you went straight to heaven we as the sharmarke family shall work hard through the foundation to ensure that your life was not in vain
4793116 i think that the team can actually pull behind matt schaub hes great and sage is always ready
4793117 the most important thing is that we establish a grinding running game to counter the passing game we already possess
4793118 this guy right here at no 6 is just absolutely ridiculous
4793119 if he has anything to say to me he should have said it to my face you write that
4793120 hes only scratched the surface plus theres the value of that pass rusher
4793121 like i said the way i am stuff like that doesnt affect me
4793122 i just told him to put the focus on what he has to do and be the best player he could be thats all he could do
4793123 going through the hard time as a rookie helped him grow up
4793124 i think through the middle of last year he started to realize how good a football player he was
4793125 im not putting the number out there but the sky is the limit i know i have to play the whole season like i did in the second half
4793126 i came in and ate right and worked out harder
4793127 im a lot quicker this game is going to the smaller quicker defensive ends i figured id be quicker and still have good size i can feel it im faster
4793128 estamos dispostos a falar co bloque se somos primeira forza
4793129 se le reconozca el per odo no laborado en ejecuci n de los actos administrativos declarados inaplicables nicamente para efectos pensionables y de antig edad en el cargo debiendo el actor abonar los aportes al r gimen previsional correspondiente
4793130 esto implicar necesariamente un reordenamiento de rutas cuyo objetivo principal ser modernizar todo el sistema de transporte p blico
4793131 obviamente podr a haber una racionalizaci n esto es un tema que se eval a y eso es parte de las responsabilidades que tiene la gerencia de transporte urbano de la municipalidad de lima
4793132 todo cambio tiene un costo pero para eso est n los planes de mitigaci n
4793133 esto afectar a a unos 500 buses de 10 empresas de transporte que all circulaban
4793134 no tengo el detalle de c mo avanzan estos planes de mitigaci n pero se contemplaba por ejemplo la capacitaci n de los conductores para ser absorbidos por la nueva concesionaria del cosac o tambi n los programas de chatarreo
4793135 no hay pues costo social damos la bienvenida a este nuevo sistema de transporte pues los 28 mil piratas tendr n que salir
4793136 mi intenci n era tener un medio por el cual comunicar para hablar de estas cosas
4793137 mi intenci n era decirle a la gente qu hab a sucedido el televisor que estaba en un estante de dos metros en la sala de mi casa se cay al piso y tambi n las cosas de mi vitrina inmediatamente tom fotos del estado en que qued mi casa y comenc a publicarlas y actualizar mi blog
4793138 a falta de informaci n exacta calcul que el epicentro hab a sido muy cerca de la costa y advert a los que viven cerca del litoral que tuvieran cuidado porque se pod a salir el mar escrib un texto muy breve pero con el paso de las horas comenc a hacer un post m s grande
4793139 eso me motiv a seguir escribiendo buscando informaci n y public ndola para mantener enterados a los lectores
4793140 esa era la idea la contribuci n con mis conocimientos y con mi experiencia a informar sobre el sismo
4793141 what stops caine from being more successful is that hes only accessible to people who are already hardcore fans write something entry level not necessarily harry potter but even more grown up entry level like most of jonathan carroll or neil gaiman something where someone who knows nothing about sf and fantasy can enjoy it and youre golden

4793155 the u s economy has continued to expand but growth has slowed as a result of the sharp housing decline disruptions in financial markets and high energy prices
4793156 because of the recent slower economic growth the labor market is likely to remain sluggish for a period of time before returning to better performance

4793168 incentives require engineered standards to be fair and to keep productivity increasing if they are not continually evaluated chances are that youll end up paying an incentive for production that you have gained over time
4793169 managing labor is a game of reducing a few pennies here and there on an organized basis to reduce the cost per order overall at the same time we need to take into account how we can motivate and increase productivity fairly to achieve our companys goals
4793170 that to ignore the facts does not change the facts

4793185 i just saw i was running well and i celebrated
4793186 he has been running very well since he was very young it was only a matter of time before he produced the times he is producing its just great for him and great for me as well to be right behind him i couldnt have asked for anything better because i dont think anyone could have beaten him the way he ran today
4793187 i came to be olympic champion and i did what i wanted
4793188 i couldnt be more satisfied i came out there and medaled he broke the world record cant say much more
4793189 my hamstring felt good it didnt bother me i wasnt too overwhelmed being the olympics it was just one of those things that happened
4793190 maybe i could have used more training or more races
4793191 my legs were behind me a little bit my mechanics werent where i wanted them to be i was feeling a little more comfortable each round but it just didnt come together
4793192 when i get back to the olympic village its really probably going to set in my family is here everyone at home is supporting me and i just feel i let them down a little bit but at the same time i did my best and everyone knows i did
4793193 the place greek to pon that is condition or situation
4793194 they go forth to the kings of the entire inhabited earth to gather them together to the war of the great day of god the almighty
4793195 i saw the wild beast human political rulership as a whole and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage the war with the one seated on the horse and with his army
4793196 those slain by jehovah will certainly come to be in that day from one end of the earth clear to the other end of the earth
4793197 i was in my happy place like i am in my really hard tempo runs
4793198 my coach john cook just told me to zone out i had no idea what place was what at the finish
4793199 im speechless this is what she trained for this is what i gave up my job for
4793200 i hate the word fluke and since last year with my bronze medal my name has been associated with it
4793201 but shalane showed that the strength of u s running is no fluke
4793202 i was expecting something from the race and i got it
4793203 it was the right place to break the world record in china next year im sure ill do it
4793204 we are saddened by the development but we have to accept it reluctantly
4793205 i respect paul very much as an athlete and human being and we had great fights
4793206 sometimes i feel sorry we were from the same generation because paul is such an extraordinary runner and person
4793207 everything is fine i only missed one week of serious training six weeks ago i am as ready as possible
4793208 she has withdrawn from the olympics and will not be traveling to beijing
4793209 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
4793210 i was always drawing always making up stories i was making comics before i was reading them
4793211 i dont put opinion in my comics opinions are boring my stories have a point of view but point of view is different from opinion having someone tell you how to raise your children is irritating but having someone tell you how they raised their children thats interesting
4793212 its much more interesting to draw comics than to make a website
4793213 way of enjoying time my way of finding the frivolity in situations
4793214 i think that was my way of trying to relate to them
4793215 es gibt keinen raum f r diskussionen in dieser angelegenheit
4793216 i came here just to win and i did just that i didnt even know id broken the world record until i did my victory lap
4793217 now im just concentrating on my two races coming up i came here prepared and im going to try and do it the 100 and 200m double
4793218 when i did take that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race im really lost for words
4793219 it is a great pity that we lost the match weve tried our best but the german team played even better
4793220 it was a hard fought match in which all paddlers played to their utmost and were exhausted i am glad that we won
4793221 they asked for 21days so by august 29 we expect that they will conduct surveys on the condition of the containers and after studying the status of the chemicals below they will start retrieving the chemicals and the crude oil
4793222 sulpicio lines already paid the down payment of 3 5milion while the 4 5 million balance is under a letter of credit thats how it goes in the industry you have to pay first they will only retrieve the shipments of del monte and bayer and the ships crude oil
4793223 it will be quicker for them to get things moving and they pay less than what they are supposed to pay
4793224 designate misdemeanors that are non jailable in that county which also eliminates indigent defense costs
4793225 bush and mccain staffs devote a lot of resources to keeping their guys in a bubble keeping them way out of touch ive seen this face to face with mccain regarding his opposition to supporting the troops major usage of the internet could make that a lot more difficult to keep a guy out of touch

4793231 you always get lemon with fish and everybody thinks that this is good for the flavour this is untrue the idea was when people ate fish originally they were so afraid of the bones getting caught in their throat and maybe die of this somebody told them if you put a little lemon in your mouth after you have a bite of fish it will kill the bone and it will disintegrate the bone i had a mathematic professor and he had a piece of fish during a test we were having and he choked on a fish bone and he died in the middle of the mathematic test
4793232 i didnt know this in paris its against the law to wash your car by using an old underwear its also against the law to give a monkey a cigarette and you cant get a fish drunk okay lets do some requests
4793233 i said lets have some requests not your requests youve got to pay more attention
4793234 thats my brother in law youre still working on the airport im happy for you
4793235 what i told james related to the nature of the enemy and the evil we are fighting today i had to counsel him that we are fighting an enemy unequaled in its brutality and barbarity that no american soldier taken captive by this enemy has returned alive
4793236 i came here just to win and i did just that i didnt even know id broken the world record until i did my victory lap
4793237 now im just concentrating on my two races coming up i came here prepared and im going to try and do it the 100 and 200m double
4793238 i dont care about the rumours hes been tested over and over again
4793239 he is the best ever sprinter and ive said that before
4793240 he has run 9 69 and got the gold so he is definitely the greatest it was a spectacular performance and he was definitely the best here he could have run faster if he had run straight through the line
4793241 i was feeling good but i didnt feel it in my legs they died on me
4793242 it feels good to be here to be part of history
4793243 it was good to finish behind him bolt because theres no way anyone on earth could have beaten him tonight
4793244 to finish second to him that is a great accomplishment in itself usain is a great athlete it was jsut a matter of time before he proved himself on this stage
4793245 i cant be more satisfied with third place he bolt broke the world record you cant ask for more
4793246 everyone could see what he did he didnt even push through the line its an amazing time
4793247 by using markets networks and communities to alter the way resources are managed to weave a fabric of incentives for sustainable growth and authentic value creation into the economy a new economic fabric thats meaningful to people
4793248 the achievement gap is the greatest civil rights issue facing our country today
4793249 when you have a healthy middle class it really does change the dynamic of schools and housing
4793250 i recognize there is still a huge achievement gap but i dont want to lose the idea that our kids are gaining
4793251 some are gaining at a faster rate that is what is widening our gap
4793252 it gives me hope when we find out there are some places in spite of difficult situations that are doing well
4793253 all of this work is going to be around the achievement gap
4793254 they are focused like a laser beam on making sure all kids get a quality education all kids get what they need out of schools

4793330 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4793331 about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4793332 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4793333 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4793334 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4793335 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4793336 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4793337 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis

4793348 if it doesnt i think well be ok since they have played together in years past if i had my choice id much rather have them do that
4793349 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
4793350 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
4793351 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

4793382 for many people chinas performance here is something of an eye opener
4793383 coming into the games we felt china should be viewed as the favorite not only because its competing at home but also because of the significant investment being made in developing what will ultimately be one of the most sophisticated sports systems ever built

4793393 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4793394 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4793395 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4793404 the church windows were opened to let the modern breeze flow through
4793405 subject concepts are to be evaluated not so much by how they cohere into a system as in terms of their capacity to articulate and undergird the ways that specific person in specific times and places struggle to become and remain subjects agents of their own histories persons who recognize the symbols and narratives that make up that history to be their symbols and narratives rather than an alienating imposition

4793440 i really want to come kick it with you youll be my american boy
4793441 i have come to inform those who will listen today that presumption is the basis of all rash judgment the soul who judges rashly presumes that he has all truth knows all the facts and therefore is free to judge a person or a situation
4793442 such a person is looking out at others too much and not looking in at himself enough in this journey through the chambers of our united hearts it is best to be critical of self and not others when you criticize others self love is at work you are tempted to feel you know best you have all the answers and therefore people should please you this is not spiritual littleness or childlikeness unless you become as little children you cannot enter my fathers kingdom
4793443 many read these messages and see only how they pertain to others but i tell you each message is for all people if you cannot look into your own heart and see how the messages address issues within you i will hold you accountable
4793444 do not become presumptuous or self righteous for any reason these are snares of satan
4793445 this is the attitude indicative of holy love in the heart such a one is loving humble and always ready to forgive he does not seek attention or praise he is not critical in his attitude that is always looking for negatives in others he is not easily offended and never presents himself as the one who must be pleased
4793446 this holy love attitude is always foremost in his heart moment to moment since it is a part of his heart he rarely needs to be reminded if the soul should slip up he quickly amends his attitudes
4793447 the opposite of one who lives in holy love is the one who is critical and judgmental by nature he has difficulty in seeing god in other people he presents himself as the one to be pleased or else suffer his wrath he has difficulty forgiving others when he is wronged
4793448 those who seek to follow the humble way of childlike love through the chambers of the united hearts should pray this prayer daily
4793449 dear jesus through the virtues of holy humility and holy love help me never to judge others remind me that i must not presume to know the motives for others actions

4793481 do you know what i just heard about your friend
4793482 before telling me anything id like you to pass a little test its called the triple filter test
4793483 before you talk to me about my friend it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what youre going to say thats why i call it the triple filter test the first filter is truth have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true
4793484 so you dont know if its true or not now lets try the second filter the filter of goodness is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good
4793485 you want to tell me something bad about him but youre not certain its true you may still pass the test though because theres one filter left the filter of usefulness is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me
4793486 if what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful why tell it to me at all

4793503 he can be called the best olympian of all time
4793504 not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and in the way hes actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure
4793505 but you have to believe the majority of the people otherwi
4793506 finally something ive always wanted to do but never have a good reason to do
4793507 a huge wave of strikes and protests fueled by growing income inequality and corporate lawlessness has prompted reforms in china on several levels the labor contract law came into effect in january 2008 and support is needed to ensure that it is enforced against a corporate backlash new laws are in the pipeline the somnolent acftu is being prodded by elements in the communist party to more aggressively defend worker interests and reform elements are emerging within the union experiments are being launched to extend collective bargaining rights in some regions and a vigorous discourse is under way in china among reformers about how to promote further reforms in the industrial relations system
4793508 american unions have fulminated against the decision of the pentagon to award a contract for 130 refuelling tankers to a european consortium headed by airbus this was a boost to jobs of unite members in britain but there is now a ferocious battle in washington to reverse this decision and award the contract to boeing it will be an important test case for the unite uswa alliance to see if the new transatlantic union can see off the protectionist attitudes of american labour
4793509 deliberately decided to hold back from demanding traditional workers rights and are instead pushing issues which they hope will have a broad appeal with core labour voters they fear that if they push an agenda focussing exclusively on improved rights for unions the main beneficiaries will be the tories
4793510 more left wing policies including increased rights to strike and higher taxes on middle earners
4793511 reverse the key labour reforms put in place by margaret thatcher in the 1980s
4793512 we may have words to say about this government about individual disputes but let us be clear about one thing the tories would be an absolute disaster for working men and women
4793513 if you have allowed the abuses at menke to go on for six months then you can use a new brain and well bring it to you
4793514 one unintended consequence of ulrs could be that they will reduce the perception on the part of employers that training is their responsibility
4793515 theres a friendly approach and a not so friendly approach and well try them both

4793518 john mccain has a perfect record on this renewable energy legislation
4793519 but its not like were involved in fights on a daily basis
4793520 for example the collective agreement now contains the right to three consecutive weeks holiday that used to be only two weeks that proposal came from the hyves group
4793521 if there was a demonstration for something we would be asked to sign the list of demands we often did so
4793522 texts on marx on the feminist working group actions demonstrations riots squatting and a letter to the pakistani government addressing the countrys education policy
4793523 wouldnt our lives be better if we could just cut the surreptitious skiving and move to a three day work week

4793532 glenn was the only one who wouldnt sign a new contract and he talked about signing a pre contract agreement with them in january
4793533 so the board thought we may as well cash in now to have funds to strengthen the squad
4793534 in the circumstances accepting a bid that met our valuation of the player was the only sensible option available to us
4793535 dave jones has been given all of the money from this transfer to strengthen the squad
4793536 every financial expert i know says that if it had failed it would have rippled throughout the entire financial community and would have caused greater problems which eventually would have come down on the average citizen if our economy continues to decline the way that its been doing
4793537 part of the problem in any recession is psychological im still optimistic that nothing is inevitable i still rely on the innovation and the talent of the us
4793538 b ut weve got to make the tax cuts permanent we need to get rid of the alternative minimum tax we need to give people a depreciation in one year for their business and investment we need to encourage research and development and tax credits that are associated with it
4793539 i will as president veto every one of these big spending bills i will impose some fiscal discipline we will clean up our act and we will regain the confidence of the american people as being careful stewards of our tax dollars and we will fix this problem with having to borrow money from china then we will balance our budget just like every governor in america has been required to do
4793540 we let spending lurch completely out of control as president of the united states id take an old veto pen that ronald reagan gave me and id veto every single pork barrel bill that comes across my desk and weve got to stop it and stop it now i look forward to it
4793541 it really is a tremendous honour to sign for a club of celtics stature

4793553 well respect georgias territorial integrity as much as the western powers respected serbias territorial integrity in 1999
4793554 in a telephone conversation confirmed to mr solana he has given the order to stop military operations
4793555 despite the russian presidents claims earlier this morning that military operations against georgia have been suspended at this moment russian fighter jets are bombarding two georgian villages outside south ossetia
4793556 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

4793563 at 12 20 0820 gmt this afternoon russian forces blew up a major railroad bridge near gori
4793564 that bridge being gone effectively results in the country losing east west railway communications
4793565 we are in peacetime why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore
4793566 we are not conducting bombardments i can say with full responsibility that this cannot be the case
4793567 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4793568 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
4793569 kid youre not so focking tough for starters youre mixing good booze with soda i could drink you under a table anywhere and still be able to adjust the color on my tv what the fock
4793570 ah lads what kind of father am i that i did not know my daughter even had a dick
4793571 dna evidence and photo evidence of the creature will be presented
4793572 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
4793573 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect

4793580 i put my application in a few days ago and was wondering if anyone had looked at it
4793581 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4793582 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4793583 the fact has not created in me a sense of obligation
4793584 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4793585 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4793586 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4793587 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
4793588 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4793589 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
4793590 weve been talking about this transaction since the state took over the leasehold in 2002 weve always thought that it was appropriate for the state to own this property
4793591 we wanted this sale to be finalized well before the lease ended so the state could maintain its broadcast facilities without the possibility of interruption
4793592 over many decades we have enjoyed a very productive working relationship with dartmouth college on the summit of mount washington
4793593 this transfer allows the division of parks and recreation to consolidate its management authority over summit operations while honoring dartmouths historic and continuing presence throughout the white mountains
4793594 there is an urgent need to bring students up to speed in these topics
4793595 the network security field needs professionals with hands on training in secure systems but only a few colleges or universities have these programs sismat meets this need
4793596 at the end of two weeks i hope our students have had significant exposure to two crucial security topics pki and vulnerability assessment two areas that are in very high demand in industry academia and government
4793597 within the timeframe of the sismat workshop our goal is to expose the students to a variety of knowledge and resources so that they have enough background to gain traction in security topics related to the course
4793598 this gift has special meaning for all of us who have had the privilege to work closely with cindy and mike biondi
4793599 always concerned with the welfare of current students always ready to lend their time and expertise they have led by example there was no bigger dartmouth baseball fan and of course mets fan than mike were grateful that this gift will have a lasting impact on our student athletes the game of baseball at dartmouth and the wider community
4793600 he set a high standard for banking and an even higher one as a mentor colleague and gentleman
4793601 i will never forget the lessons he taught me both in business and in life
4793602 this ballpark will satisfy our programmatic needs and allow a sport with a storied history at dartmouth to be as successful as it can be
4793603 at the northernmost ivy league school the weather isnt always so kind to baseball the artificial playing surface will greatly enhance our ability to practice and compete on the field
4793604 this is hugely important to our players and will greatly improve their day to day lives on the field
4793605 we owe so much to cindy and mike biondi working closely with mike over the last few years i know now why he was so highly regarded as a leader on his team and one of the most respected men on wall street
4793606 we are so grateful to kathy and rick kimball for these wonderful gifts their generosity honors the past as it looks to the future
4793607 these gifts celebrate the lives and careers of two great dartmouth graduates while at the same time ensuring that the education that helped nurture their good works in the world outside hanover will be just as strong and relevant for another generation of students
4793608 this gift helps us succeed at two of the most important aspects of our mission
4793609 endowed professorships honor accomplishments of our distinguished faculty and the new auditorium provides a wonderful place for faculty and students to come together for innovative teaching and learning
4793610 dartmouth is the strongest its ever been thanks to the extraordinary leadership provided by jim wright
4793611 we are grateful to this exceptional team of talented individuals who are willing and able to devote countless hours to the search for dartmouths next leader
4793612 articulate a compelling vision of the collective aspirations for dartmouth its future its place in higher education and its place in the world we serve
4793613 ntfs is marked to be in use cannot mount partition
4793614 the file windows system32 pci sys is missing or corrupted try repairing with xp cd
4793615 our campus environment is the perfect place for this project because we can examine live network activity at scale and in real time
4793616 weve worked in laboratory settings with controlled parameters now its time for a live real world test for organizations that depend on their wireless networks like we do this research should prove invaluable
4793617 weve ensured that strict processes are in place to monitor the project to protect the privacy of our wi fi users
4793618 i think the findings coming out of dist will greatly benefit the cyber security initiative its kind of like having a computer security safety net protecting us
4793619 at least for the state of the economy in new hampshire perhaps 25 percent of the tax rebate will actually serve to stimulate the economy
4793620 the proposed uses of the federal rebate checks by respondents will do little to stimulate economic growth in the state
4793621 working for the prs means providing nonpartisan objective research to both the new hampshire state legislature and local town governments from the responses to our poll questions it is clear that new hampshire citizens rely heavily on the governing role played by these state and local institutions so the poll made me feel that the research i do for the prs is valued by new hampshire citizens
4793622 few people understand the time consuming effort that goes into producing a reliable set of data it took weeks to assemble the survey instrument and a team of nearly 20 callers working three hours per night for five nights to complete the poll i believe the end result and the precedent set for future rockefeller center polls was certainly worth the time commitment
4793623 my goals for the institute include supporting the excellent work in place at dartmouth exploring new ways to extend that work supporting the expansion of writing and rhetoric instruction across students dartmouth careers collaboratively implementing assessment of students progress and fostering faculty members discussions about their own and their students work in writing and scholarly presentation
4793624 dr donahue was selected as the candidate who best fit the current needs of the institute
4793625 she brings both experience in writing program administration and strong credentials as a teacher and a scholar dr donahues background in examining writing from a cross cultural perspective connects well with dartmouths commitment to diversity and to excellence in our efforts at writing instruction
4793626 i approach the re launch of speech at dartmouth with enthusiasm excited by the opportunity to add my voice to the continuing conversation
4793627 speech instruction must go beyond a simple list stand up straight speak up slow down the best public speakers have a nuanced view of what constitutes good public speaking reflecting rhetorical principles and theory i design my courses as forums to grapple with the complexities of speaking well my courses provide forums for the study and practice of public speaking by the end of the course students are better speakers thats a simple goal the process of reaching it is difficult but worth it
4793628 the institute will provide wonderful opportunities for dartmouth students in the coming years the commitment of our faculty to teaching writing and critical thinking across the curriculum and the efforts of dedicated program members current director tom cormen and his staff have ensured that the institute will be a success
4793629 it is as i have said a small podcast and yet there are those who love it
4793630 i am deeply moved that each year a diverse group of students of different faith traditions and ethnicities are committed to and willing to confront first hand the legacy of one of the most tragic events in the history of western civilization the genocide of the jewish people of europe
4793631 my own humanity and my own rabbinate have been transformed in many ways because of the nature of the encounters i have with students and with this program
4793632 my family is originally from ukraine and i had always wanted to visit there
4793633 the most interesting element of the trip for me is that its not a jewish trip instead it is a diverse group of students from different religious backgrounds and perspectives and this dynamic enriches the experience we learn from each other and our different experiences to consider new ways of thinking about history
4793634 for one i grew strongly attached to eastern europe as it was a part of my familys history it inspired me to do more active genealogical research on my family and identified a few towns that they came from the experience allowed me to connect to a different part of the world completely out of my comfort zone and expand my horizons cultural interactions with eastern europeans taught me new things about life through a different lens
4793635 because we are able to go consistently each year were developing a modest reputation
4793636 we do receive calls to visit specific villages so as to restore its jewish cemetery sometimes the requests come from people whose ancestors once lived in these towns sometimes the requests come from the people currently living in the towns who need help preserving their history i hope we continue this work because unfortunately there is no shortage of jewish cemeteries that need our help
4793637 les africains et maghr bins avaient sauv la france les en croire eux seuls
4793638 sensitivity of the action observation network to physical and observational learning
4793639 its been established in previous research that there are correlations in behavioral performance between active and passive learning but in this study we were surprised by the remarkable similarity in brain activation when our research participants observed dance sequences that were actively or passively experienced
4793640 we collected fmri data before and after five days of both visual and physical training
4793641 and there was common aon activity when watching the practiced and observed dance sequences
4793642 robotics is becoming more ubiquitous were trying to stay very much on the cutting edge and exploring whats very very current
4793643 were giving the students a different experience and thats exciting for us
4793644 the students were excited about something most students dont get excited about
4793645 the camp is a great opportunity to see math differently than what you see in school
4793646 the students get to see it used in things we do everyday like sending information over the internet thats something a lot of people fail to realize
4793647 this was a way to expose them to the process to solving problems while getting their hands dirty too
4793648 theres a lot of attention today on global food shortages
4793649 weve found a gene that is key for proper chloroplast function this finding might some day help scientists develop plants that grow better and can serve as more nutritious food
4793650 we have now shown that an analogous process is required for proper chloroplast function
4793651 moreover without fro7 plants sown in iron deficient soil died as young seedlings our findings are of particular interest because how iron gets into chloroplasts has not been well understood despite the significance of iron in chloroplasts
4793652 enriching crops with mineral and vitamin nutrients will provide sustainable solutions to malnutrition
4793653 evelynn shares our commitment to diversity and i know she will be an asset to our community
4793654 dartmouth has many attributes to promote to potential faculty and staff
4793655 her knowledge of equal opportunity and affirmative action guidelines and statutes experience in resolving conflicts and expertise in advancing diversity initiatives in higher education will certainly be beneficial in our efforts to recruit and retain faculty and staff from diverse backgrounds
4793656 my research has shown that two thirds of older americans dont clearly understand basic financial concepts such as compound interest the effects of inflation and risk diversification
4793657 furthermore this lack of financial literacy can be linked to a lack of preparedness for retirement i hope my work will raise awareness and help address this national problem
4793658 baby boomer retirement security the roles of planning financial literacy and housing wealth
4793659 what these teachers have in common is a deep commitment to transforming english language education at public schools in their country
4793660 its heartening to have such wide reaching participation from dartmouth faculty and alumni who are professional educators
4793661 dartmouth has always emphasized innovation education and research so this affiliation with the clinton global initiative is an ideal fit with our mission and our aspirations
4793662 through this project the rassias center is having a positive impact on the lives of the mexican workforce in such a way that the country will reap the benefits for generations
4793663 clearly they violated the texas open meetings act by doing this
4793664 once again we find ourselves inspired by the generosity of dartmouths alumni parents and friends and the commitment they make year after year to the next generation of students and faculty
4793665 their philanthropy ensures that we can fulfill our historic mission to provide a transformative learning environment fostered by close student faculty interactions and shared out of classroom experiences with the aim of preparing men and women to contribute to their professions their communities and the world
4793666 given the economy and debate within the dartmouth community over governance we were heartened by these results and not surprised that participation was down
4793667 behind the accomplishment of each fund raising target is a common driver exceptional volunteer leadership we are indebted to the thousands of dartmouth alumni and parents who lead by example and articulate for others the impact that their charitable gifts have on the college her students and the broader society
4793668 we want to get this material recycled for a couple reasons
4793669 you are dealing with some toxic materials youve got lead and all of those computer and television screens and thats cadmium in there too another heavy metal
4793670 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise

4793678 they arent shy and in this fund raising effort theyve been particularly vocal about their commitment to the next generation of dartmouth students
4793679 this is an extraordinary achievement the 2008s made a splash in their final days before leaving the green which is no surprise to anyone who has had the good fortune to know them these last four years
4793680 they arent shy and in this fund raising effort theyve been particularly vocal about their commitment to the next generation of dartmouth students
4793681 we spent four years following different paths through dartmouth this was our first opportunity to come together and make a collective statement about what this school means to us and the importance of preserving the colleges future
4793682 it was a privilege to be involved with the campaign our volunteers did a great job reaching out to the student body
4793683 it is exceptionally important that dartmouth has chosen to so publically acknowledge elementary and secondary school teachers
4793684 it simultaneously celebrates and elevates a noble yet underappreciated profession
4793685 by establishing this award the college is encouraging its graduating seniors to reflect on the extraordinarily gifted and dedicated teachers whose work has enabled them to be successful once they arrived at dartmouth
4793686 it takes a whole village to raise a child but it only takes one great teacher to inspire an entire generation of leaders and that is kristins legacy in igiugig therefore my success at dartmouth is because i am standing on the shoulder of giants i am a reflection of my parents and extended family my village of igiugig and especially the dedication of teachers of which kristin has proven the most exceptional
4793687 professor leavitt wrote my recommendation letters for college and he is without a doubt one of the most loved professors in my school if not puerto rico no one can call him an easy professor he is not easy because he expects a lot from his students he is one of the best professors i have ever had and not only as a professor but as a person of great sensitivity and humanity i believe he deserves this prize more than anybody i have ever met
4793688 mr tintle helped shape who i am as a person by making history more interesting and closely tied to my life inspiring me to be an independent person being a strong respected role model and dedicating so much of his time and caring nature to ensure that his students strive to be the best they can be and have his whole hearted support in all aspects of life
4793689 in my high school which is predominately polynesian i was encouraged not to apply to dartmouth
4793690 as hard as things can be you need to remember that they are all temporary things
4793691 i love dartmouth but im always reminded that im an other at home everyone looks alike here im a minority i really pushed myself here to try new things and find a community
4793692 i tell prospies prospective students that dartmouth will challenge you try to be prepared
4793693 i also let them know that there are resources on campus that can help and that there are many opportunities to affect change on campus
4793694 i know from personal experience that its hard to take charity

4793696 my mom was actually going in for thyroid surgery for a different reason and she gave up her spot with the surgeon so that i could go in and have my left thyroid removed so that i could go back to school on time in the fall
4793697 as a swimmer i could always eat whatever i wanted and on the diet you have to monitor what you eat my whole family went on the diet with me which was extremely helpful i dont think i could have done it without them
4793698 i was petrified i knew i wasnt in shape to swim and i didnt feel like id had a summer to relax then i realized that i had this amazing support network at school and instead of sitting at home and feeling sorry for myself i needed to go to my friends go to my coach and rely on them to help me get back on track and i think dartmouths something you want to come back to
4793699 i think having cancer really made me realize how important swimming is and in a way it revived my love for the sport
4793700 it gave me something to prove to myself that i could come back and persevere
4793701 these initiatives represent our continuing commitment to keeping dartmouth at the forefront of higher education and to offering an unsurpassed educational experience
4793702 given the uncertainty created by the pending litigation the board believes it should delay any changes to its membership until the resolution of these questions in the courts as requested by the complainants

4793706 the superior court confirmed the town of hanover and the colleges position that the college does not need a special exception because it is an educational use building
4793707 in addition the court found that dartmouths plans for this new building exceed the towns site plan requirements dartmouth met numerous times with abutters and neighbors we modified the proposed building in response to neighbor concerns provided improvements to other buildings in its vicinity and will manage the construction activities in a way to ease the impact on the neighborhood im very pleased that the court recognized our efforts and i hope we can begin construction soon
4793708 im relieved that the courts confirmed that this is an educational building my colleagues and i are eager to get into this new space and get on with our work of teaching and exploring the scientific frontiers of the life sciences with dartmouth undergraduates and graduate students
4793709 it is as i have said a small podcast and yet there are those who love it

4793716 nick took two courses from me one of which consisted mostly of graduate students nick was one of only two undergraduates but was still the strongest in the class both intellectually and in grades so i was elated when nick approached me to do an honors thesis under my supervision nick got interested in failure detectors which is a research topic in the broader area of distributed algorithms over the last two terms we worked together to identify a certain failure detector that provides necessary and sufficient information to solve a fundamental problem in distributed computing known as mutual exclusion nick gave an excellent presentation of this research to a faculty committee and the computer science department awarded high honors to nick for his thesis research i am very impressed by nicks initiative perseverance ability and passion for research i am fortunate to have had him as my student

4793718 jean ellen is obviously highly intelligent but she is much more than that she brings a kind of curiosity imaginativeness and even exuberance to every project that made working with her both in the classroom and on her year long honors thesis a wonderful experience
4793719 jean ellen overflows with intellectual energy and curiosity ive always been impressed by how lightly she carries her many talents the renaissance referred to this quality as
4793720 gpa numbers do not begin to suggest the formidable intelligence the originality and the depth of intellectual curiosity and independence that inform margarets work the longer papers she wrote for me were potentially publishable every short response to the novels was a mini work of art all of her work fused sophisticated theoretical exploration with extraordinary attention to textual detail showing an agility of mind and a depth of perception that continue to amaze me she is about the most serious and engaged student i have ever taught and i do not say that lightly
4793721 dan is one of the most conscientious students with whom weve worked always willing to engage in an intellectual discussion and perhaps more importantly always prepared to extend and expand on themes and ideas presented in the course
4793722 he is an original and fearless thinker one who never slavishly reiterates what is expressed in lectures and readings but who instead carefully considers the material and forms his own reasoned opinion

4793738 it means your organization is really positioned to soar and you dont have to deal with daily dragging down of undefined problems or blame thrown both ways
4793739 agreement on governance up front is probably the thing i see thats missing in most nonprofit organizations
4793740 there are not clearly defined expectations clearly defined roles and responsibilities
4793741 if you have a working board who is going to be involved in the day to day activities of the organization then you probably shouldnt have somebody whose only reason to be on the board is because they want to tell their friends that theyre on the board of this exciting organization youre probably not going to get any work out of them
4793742 that makes sense when the arts organization is in fact an institution if youre dealing with a symphony or a large theater or an opera there youve got a board of directors which establishes the basic mission of that organization which is to provide an art form to the community
4793743 that may not be as appropriate for an organization that is built around the vision of a single artist
4793744 strategic planning and governance can set you free it means your organization is really positioned to soar
4793745 as an artistic director or an executive director essentially the board is your boss
4793746 but you have a lot of say in who those people are and they rely on you a lot to tell you how things are going its a bizarre relationship
4793747 we have an incubator program that houses about 40 emerging organizations none of whom have their 501 c 3 yet probably half of them are focused on doing that and are going towards that goal
4793748 and the other half just arent sure thats the model thats going to get their work done most effectively
4793749 those who dont worry too much about prices and like to spend their money on travel or dinners rather than new cars are generally happier than those who spend a lot on expensive purchases and carry credit card debt
4793750 understanding the demographics and the different influences that play into gambling can help psychologists tailor their interventions for people who get into trouble
4793751 moderate income x gamblers big fish are at the most risk for losing the most money and suffering the most overwhelming financial and psychological consequences the whales can afford to lose money and the jumbo shrimps dont have much money to lose
4793752 this type of time frame helps people see steady progress along the way while not feeling too much pressure
4793753 even though guilt and shame are often interchangeably used each is a distinct emotion
4793754 participants who felt guilty about the impulse buying used proactive coping strategies such as adjusting budgets and planning to reduce impulse buying in the future on the other hand shameful buyers used more avoidant emotion focused strategies such as denial and reframing the incident to be less injurious to the self
4793755 save tomorrow the effects of time frame duration and delay on personal savings estimates of consumers

4793757 it is as i have said a small podcast and yet there are those who love it
4793758 being recognized for our security work is quite an honor
4793759 i am pleased that dartmouth was selected as one of the first nsa centers of excellence in both education and research in information assurance this designation reflects the strength of the program built by dartmouths institute for security technology studies over the past decade
4793760 the designation acknowledges the strength of dartmouths teaching and research directed towards cyber security
4793761 these complex problems involve social as well as technical questions and benefit from the interdisciplinary approach dartmouth provides
4793762 welcomes dartmouth to the program and looks forward to working closely with students and faculty to benefit the security of the nation
4793763 duvas main goal right now is to support each other
4793764 many people helped me here at dartmouth and elsewhere and i wanted to establish a veteran network on campus so we can take care of each other
4793765 im pleased that our undergraduate veterans have come together with this common bond
4793766 the international nature of their group is distinctive and i think it fosters global awareness im proud of these veterans and i hope other dartmouth students find opportunities to learn from duva
4793767 i think we provide an official vehicle for talking about the needs and experiences of student veterans to the larger campus community
4793768 we also provide support for new veterans coming to campus or thinking about coming to dartmouth and we hope we can facilitate discussions where non veteran students and veterans can share perspectives
4793769 they are all working hard to situate themselves and get back into the stream of life again after serving in the military
4793770 it is as i have said a small podcast and yet there are those who love it
4793771 the village where my familys from was the first alaskan native village to use the act
4793772 throughout the 1940 50s 60s and 70s a much larger portion of indian and alaskan native children were taken away from their homes more than any other race and often with very little reason they were nearly always sent away to a non native family usually in a different state
4793773 the students who write articles or submit research for publication in the dujs do not have advanced degrees and decades of laboratory experience what they do have however is a genuine intellectual interest in the sciences and a strong academic grounding in their field of interest
4793774 i think undergrads use it to get an idea of what might be possible for them if they do research here
4793775 im impressed that it is student inspired student run and the students have kept it rolling and continued the high level of content
4793776 im really interested in science communication and in making scientific news accessible to everyone
4793777 i also enjoy collaborating with the other students it takes a lot of work to put each issue together and we rely on each other to complete all the writing editing and layout to meet our deadlines
4793778 i find the dujs to be a medium of personal growth for me
4793779 i am proud that a decades worth of dartmouth students have been impacted positively by the journals strong presence in their midst scientists here and elsewhere have been genuinely interested in the developments propagated by the journal as evidenced by the worldwide subscriptions
4793780 the credibility of the journal is enhanced by a devotion to ethical decision making and a focus on getting the facts right the first time around
4793781 the dujs serves to enhance scientific dialogue and inform students about each others work which in turn allows for collaboration and peer to peer learning
4793782 were sure that theres probably some facts and information thats just not available i mean you see a lot on the video but we need to make sure everything is revealed before we take any action

4793788 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4793789 you can make these up to one week in advance
4793790 theres no technological reason why you cant play cross platform but theres a philosophical reason why design doesnt want to do it if we have to compromise one platform to support both then we wont

4793810 achieving the gold certification for this and other recent construction reflects dartmouths broader commitment to energy efficiency and green technology
4793811 dartmouth is building green and renovating green both because it supports the institutional goal of sustainability and because it serves the mission of educating our community about the ways we can protect and conserve our resources
4793812 we can build the most efficient building in the world but if people fill them with energy hogging appliances or waste energy while living in the building the environment still loses
4793813 it is simple and easy to change our behavior in order to help save the environment sometimes all we need is some information and feedback to understand the results of each action we take

4793817 these endowments are made to honor the memory of my grandparents sir edwin and lady manton
4793818 i have fond memories of studying in the reserve reading room as a student at dartmouth because the space was made so much more alive by the murals our gift reflects my familys appreciation of the importance of the work and my grandparents lifelong support of the arts
4793819 i admired sir edwin immensely and i am so pleased that the manton foundation has made this generous gift in his memory
4793820 at dartmouth we stress a hands on experiential approach to learning whether its in the humanities the sciences or social sciences generations of students have studied the orozco murals or studied under them in baker library this gift will not only safeguard and promote one of our cherished artworks but will help advance our digital media program which is a major priority for the college

4793829 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4793830 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4793835 the news media play an essential role in how we learn about and use digital tools
4793836 im interested to learn what our guests think for example about how email text messaging and social networking websites have an impact on old fashioned face to face human interactions and whether online news and blogs could possibly replace print newspapers and magazines someday the participants at our summit will have a unique vantage point on these issues
4793837 in my time at the college in a variety of positions ive come to appreciate the importance of a dedicated and sustained effort around diversity issues and opportunities
4793838 in my new role as vice president i look forward to working with faculty staff and students so that together we can create the most inclusive environment for living learning and working
4793839 hollys involvement in diversity on this campus is well known
4793840 she has demonstrated an unrelenting commitment to making dartmouth an inclusive place for students faculty and staff and i look forward to her continued work in this area
4793841 president life long commitment to the advancement of human rights and the spread of democracy has had a profound impact on her nation of liberia and it is an honor to have her as this years commencement speaker her example is a powerful demonstration of the contributions that an individual can make and i know she will serve as an inspiration to dartmouth students

4793848 women constitute a majority of the population yet their lives achievements and contributions are underrepresented in museums less than five percent of the 2 400 national historic landmarks chronicle womens achievements and findings suggest that only 10 percent of the average u s history textbook is devoted to women we need a national womens history museum because womens history is largely missing from our nations memorials museums and textbooks
4793849 recognizing the achievements made by american women will promote a better understanding of our history and culture
4793850 the women who have persevered for years to develop the idea of a national womens history museum have shaped a vision that i am proud to co sponsor as legislation they deserve the support of the american people in the task of raising a museum in the nations capital that places the history of the women in our nation front and center in the nations capital

4793882 we thought this would stimulate the interest of the present day young offenders to investigate crime and punishment in the 19th century which it did
4793883 they were very interested in how young the children were who were sentenced and one of the offenders picked up on the case of sophia constable from whitby who was 11 when she was sentenced
4793884 it makes it possible to talk about these things in a slightly more distanced way because its all about the past
4793885 so theres stuff in there that allows them to talk about how things are now
4793886 some of these topics are in a sense too close to home but what the archives do is put that at a distance i think thats a way of using the archives very well because theres a resonance with their own situations
4793887 its been a great project i think its not only a first for this record office but its a first among record offices anywhere
4793888 were very pleased and very proud and a lot of my colleagues have been saying to me this is what i came to archives to do
4793889 the danger with archives is that it can have impacts like this and the outcomes can be there and we dont capture it
4793890 i think that one of the most impressive things about this process is the degree to which that capture process was an integral part of it
4793891 they sort of raised their game in relation to it and im not aware of any other projects that have such successful outcomes
4793892 i think its something archives can do on a very regular basis but i think the rarity is being able to capture it and pass it on so that people can actually see it

4793898 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4793899 about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4793900 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4793901 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4793902 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4793903 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4793904 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4793905 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis

4793943 even the arab minority in the city has shown its preference for living under israeli rule as many have moved to the israeli side of the security barrier being built around jerusalem their choice is reasonable as jerusalem offers the quality of life of a modern western city while only a few kilometers away the norm is a third world standard of living chaos and religious intolerance an undivided jerusalem is the best guarantee of a better life for all jerusalemites
4793944 those who believe that jerusalem should not be divided and mean by that that the arab neighborhoods should not be separated from the city should be the first to insist that an active policy be adopted by the government and the municipality to improve the lot of local arab residents barring that jerusalem will continue to remain a divided city

4793949 she should be careful of her health during this two year period as neptune transiting her house of health can possibly bring a health crisis
4793950 madonna should be focusing on altruistic activities otherwise it can create a lot of negative publicity this is not a good time for her to be seeking any accolade for its own sake its far better for her to perform acts of altruism that are for communities and the benefit of the world rather than spend time on projects which will get her noticed just for publicity if she seeks no rewards and does work for the goodness of the masses she will reap great benefits

4794098 for many people chinas performance here is something of an eye opener
4794099 coming into the games we felt china should be viewed as the favorite not only because its competing at home but also because of the significant investment being made in developing what will ultimately be one of the most sophisticated sports systems ever built

4794105 grotes writing is as likely to dabble in meta literary tricks as it is to trade in the sensationalism of science fiction comic books and supernatural yarns im very fascinated with that convergence between the heightened elements of genre entertainment and literary sophistication the bearded playwright said in a july interview in the woolly greenroom when the two sensibilities collide he added it illuminates both the mythical nature of these genre conventions but also the magical nature of the mundane and everyday that double edged approach to storytelling has impressed local theater power brokers hes one of our biggest thinking playwrights in america today says woolly artistic director howard shalwitz he doesnt write a play that doesnt have some gigantic idea embedded in it shalwitz points for instance to the spooky shape shifter whose haunting of the blood relatives in maria stuart invites you to think big thoughts

4794127 it is shocking to know that the u s is holding hundreds of juveniles in iraq and afghanistan and even more disturbing that there is no comprehensive policy in place that will protect their rights as children
4794128 juveniles and former child soldiers should be treated first and foremost as candidates for rehabilitation and reintegration into society not subjected to further victimization
4794129 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent

4794158 id like to correct an error in the above quotation from your web site i was one of the soldiers in battalion 52 which captured aker the village fell without a fight after we fired only a few shots the inhabitants were brought to the village square and asked to hand over their weapons they were given 24 hours to do so and in the interim we left when we returned at the time we had set to collect the weapons the village was empty the villagers left voluntarily no one was expelled im proud to have been a soldier in the givati brigade in 1948 the only one of the brigades in the war of independence in whose sector not a single arab remained without having expelled people from their homes

4794176 as we return to the masters house i want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path
4794177 did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of your path but not on the other pots side thats because i have always known about your flaw and i took advantage of it i planted flower seeds on your side of the path and every day while we walk back from the stream youve watered them for two years i have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my masters table without you being just the way you are he would not have this beauty to grace his house

4794212 well it was the first game of the season we had a physical game on wednesday night and i was worried before the game that we would not be sharp we made a good start were always in control but could not finish the game off
4794213 you have that old story in the game when you cannot finish the game off you feel you deserved to be punished when theres 10 minutes to go
4794214 i am pleased with the fact that we didnt concede a goal we scored two on wednesday one today so its better than the reverse overall it was a good week for us a winning start a win in the champions league so yes a good week
4794215 he has shown he is an intelligent player he has good technique and can integrate well with the team he also worked hard for the team he added something that people wanted from him in france and that was to score goals he started to score some goals towards the end of last season and had a scoring start here today
4794216 im not really worried about the lack of goals because i dont feel we were sharp enough to finish off what we created
4794217 we created many chances but its about converting them look at the amount we scored in the last 10 years and you can see we scored a few even last year we had a very good striking force it was not so much offensively we were punished last year it was defensively
4794218 we just started the season and i know ill hear that we must win a trophy 38 times and im prepared for that
4794219 he has shown in pre season he is a good player and he will take part in our team we have four strikers and he is one of them in a season like this one we have 60 games so he will play games but he is going to mexico tomorrow afternoon
4794220 they defended intelligently and played in a positive way you expected them at some stage to crumble but they never did and they kept going until the last second of the game they have fantastic spirit and a positive attitude towards the game they were not dirty they were resilient and well organised
4794221 we made 83 points last year and lost only three games we have stability in this club that allows us to feel that we can improve on last year we lost three games and in two of the games we were leading 1 0 with 20 minutes to go we lost some big names but what is important is what we produce on the pitch last year we were four points behind man united and we didnt win a trophy however we won the trophy of the most unlucky team we had injuries to players for very long periods too we lost tomas rosicky robin van persie and eduardo
4794222 is a trophy to finish 12th and win the carling cup for me a real quality of a team is to fight for the championship if you dont win it youre very frustrated but what is important for me is the consistency of the club and of the team you have to accept that the level is very high when you fight for a title two or three points difference in the end is not a big gap last year that is where we finished we were there until the end
4794223 it was our first game and i think we did a good job
4794224 we wanted to win our first game and start well
4794225 y para lograr eso hacen cualquier cosa menos mal que en venezuela esa tendencia es aun incipiente y no se ha esparcido pero estamos trabajando en ello es la moda de la celebridad y es gratificante para el ego

4794229 i am pleased with my team that we are so good in form we played well and got the ball forward quickly
4794230 we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a poition to put an opponent under pressure
4794231 our combination play isnt together yet but this will come automatically with improved fitness in the coming weeks
4794232 a lot has been changed at the club for the good of the players and for the staff but we know its of no use if the results dont come
4794233 however i think it was a good start because hsv hamburg were lively moved well and caused us a lot of problems so a draw was a fair outcome
4794234 the only negative thing was that we gave away a 2 0 lead
4794235 well done girl you are on top of my list as one of the greatest person ive ever known keep doing on what you have been doing right now and surely one day you are gonna be a great reporter or it wo man whatever and who knows maybe youll end up with something big just like what googleguys did

4794280 with the fall in oil and other commodity prices in the past month both the markets and fed officials had started to turn away from inflation risks and focus on growth risks
4794281 the view which we agree with is that with the usual long and variable lags falling commodity prices and rising unemployment will drive down inflation no need for the fed to get its hands dirty when the housing and credit crunch will do the job
4794282 the markets are in such a forgiving mood that both the stock and bond markets rallied on thursday despite what can only be described as an ugly cpi report

4794337 la gente est contenta con lo que estamos haciendo balada con un toque muy sutil de m sica mexicana pero lo que dice es que no quiere que deje la m sica mexicana o el traje charro
4794338 es dif cil al principio pero es parte del precio que se pague

4794342 yo estaba en la secundaria cuando ella salt al estrellato ahora que sus primeros fans tenemos m s de 30 vemos a madonna como una especie de precursora de lo que ser nuestro futuro y el futuro se ve muy bien
4794343 me parece que madonna es una gran empresaria una mujer visionaria que sabe lo que quiere y c mo obtenerlo sabe manejar al p blico y es muy segura de s misma en el escenario quiz no es la m sica que me guste escuchar pero le admiro su visi n empresarial
4794344 madonna es maravillosa un ejemplo de mujer controversial la admiro reconozco que no he vivido tan de cerca su carrera me gusta mucho pero no me vuelve loca la respeto ha impuesto modas en todo en la m sica en la ropa recuerdo el esc ndalo mundial que caus con el libro que sac sex la vi en concierto en miami me impresion su profesionalismo ahora que est en m xico tratar de ir a verla
4794345 creo que madonna es la reina la top no hay nadie arriba de ella yo creo que es la diva de divas creo que es la mujer que ha marcado la pauta es incre ble que una mujer de 50 a os tenga el cuerpo que tiene est ca n y que sea la que rige la moda el espect culo la m sica es bien dif cil ser el icono mundial porque no estamos hablando de que es el icono de los chavitos de los gringos no es un icono mundial y lo que ella se ponga hace moda lo que ella cante hace moda sus shows imponen estilo es una innovadora una punta de lanza en todo lo que hace y es bien dif cil que alguien logre ese impacto a nivel mundial por eso es la reina del pop
4794346 la amo tengo discos videos de ella sus espect culos lo que hace ella lo sigo yo

4794348 qu m s se puede decir que no se haya dicho me gustan algunas canciones pero no soy fan s qu discos saca y qu est haciendo me gusta cuando trabaja con gente que admiro como mirwais ahmadza y pues se me hace una empresaria impresionante creo que logr lo que muchos otros no hacer algo alrededor de ella muy grande la empresa madonna debe ser muy disciplinada para hacer eso su mejor poca fue o la que yo viv fue borderline porque yo estaba chico y me gustaban los videos

4794376 were definitely seeing continual shifts the great unwashed those people who have never sent a text message is getting smaller all the time
4794377 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4794378 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4794379 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4794380 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4794381 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4794382 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4794389 el compromiso para que ning n acto comprobado de corrupci n quede impune en la rep blica dominicana ni para que ninguna acci n dolosa o fraudulenta en perjuicio del inter s nacional quede sin ser ejemplarmente sancionada
4794390 una revoluci n moral que instaure como principio el criterio de que no puede haber mayor riqueza en el mundo que el sentido del honor y la satisfacci n del deber cumplido
4794391 esas reformas se han hecho tomando en consideraci n las mejores pr cticas internacionales y las condiciones particulares de nuestra econom a y en poco tiempo han contribuido a institucionalizar el manejo de las finanzas p blicas del pa s
4794392 todas esas reformas resultar an irrelevantes sin embargo si al mismo tiempo no logramos prevenir perseguir y castigar esa hidra de siete cabezas que erosiona la credibilidad y legitimidad del sistema pol tico democr tico la corrupci n
4794393 los hechos recientes de violencia acaecidos en el pa s han generado una gran consternaci n y constituyen una voz de alerta de que bajo ninguna circunstancia debemos decaer en el combate a las drogas y a la criminalidad

4794420 of course the democratic party is breathing a giant sigh of relief what if edwards had won the nomination theyd be looking at the prospect of their nominee engulfed in a sexual scandal that makes bill clinton look like a prude since edwards didnt win the only harm to the democrats is that yet another one of their heroes has been exposed as a lying lout he joins a large club
4794421 i am vetoing this proposal because it is unfair to raise the vehicle registration fee from 75 to 95 for only city of milwaukee residents at a time when residents are already grappling with increases in food and fuel prices a 26 increase in the vehicle registration fee and a complete elimination of the responsibility of other property owners is not the road to go down
4794422 if milwaukee dramatically increases the number of kids who take the act well no longer be in the number one or two in the country were going to drop if the state of wisconsin wants to be one or two in the act theyre going to have to figure out ways to help milwaukee kids do better
4794423 here we are in 2008 and its early august and were already seeing problems im very concerned that were going to see more problems throughout 2008
4794424 this is the very reason i have fought for photo id in order to receive a ballot we have added more names on the voter rolls and we still have no idea if the person that is handed the ballot is truly that person

4794506 la cual oper en cristo resucit ndole de los muertos y sent ndole a su diestra en los lugares celestiales
4794507 y juntamente con l nos resucit y asimismo nos hizo sentar en los lugares celestiales con cristo jes s

4794702 it is even more important now for people to have a professional looking resume since theres so much competition
4794703 you always think what could i have done different what could i have done better what could i have done to help more
4794704 shes one of those examples of not just talking but doing
4794705 she does a lot of things very quietly not for recognition and not for thank yous she does it because she genuinely believes in the community and sees good in everybody
4794706 its tough to scrounge up floor credentials but i did get in to see kemps acceptance speech and doles convention speech
4794707 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
4794708 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
4794709 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
4794710 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4794711 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4794712 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4794713 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4794714 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4794715 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4794716 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4794717 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
4794718 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4794719 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4794720 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4794721 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4794722 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4794723 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4794724 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4794725 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4794726 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4794727 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4794728 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4794729 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4794730 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4794731 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4794732 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4794733 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4794734 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4794735 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4794736 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4794737 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4794738 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4794739 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4794740 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4794741 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4794742 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4794743 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4794744 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4794745 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4794746 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4794747 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4794748 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4794749 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4794750 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4794751 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4794752 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4794753 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4794754 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4794755 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4794756 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4794757 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4794758 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4794759 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4794760 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4794761 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4794762 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4794763 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4794764 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4794765 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4794766 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4794767 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4794768 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4794769 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4794770 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4794771 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4794772 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4794773 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4794774 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4794775 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4794776 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4794777 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4794778 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4794779 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4794780 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4794781 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4794782 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4794783 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4794784 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4794785 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4794786 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4794787 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4794788 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4794789 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4794790 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4794791 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4794792 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4794793 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4794794 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4794795 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4794796 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4794797 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4794798 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4794799 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4794800 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4794801 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4794802 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4794803 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4794804 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4794805 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4794806 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4794807 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4794808 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4794809 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4794810 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4794811 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4794812 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4794813 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4794814 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4794815 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4794816 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4794817 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4794818 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4794819 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4794820 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4794821 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4794822 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4794823 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4794824 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4794825 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4794826 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4794827 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4794828 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4794829 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4794830 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4794831 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4794832 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4794833 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4794834 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4794835 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4794836 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4794837 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4794838 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4794839 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4794840 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4794841 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4794842 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4794843 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4794844 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4794845 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4794846 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4794847 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4794848 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4794849 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4794850 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4794851 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4794852 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4794853 esos cargos pueden convertir a sus protagonistas seg n su desempe o en sepulturas o pedestales
4794854 my name is vermin love supreme and im running for president
4794855 in some ways if you know youre going to lose expressing your true beliefs is more important i think thats what you have with some candidates
4794856 maybe you have an issue that you really care about or you get a story written about you
4794857 winning is a long shot but it is a realistic possibility
4794858 ronald reagan didnt have a great chance of winning when he first started running jimmy carter had very little chance of winning when he first started running
4794859 the republican party left me the republican party is no longer the one i joined and worked with for three decades
4794860 it is no longer the party of small government and lower taxes it is a party that very clearly is illustrated by the bush administration that believes in absolute power residing in the executives
4794861 remove our economic security blanket that is costing the american people billions of dollars every month
4794862 the libertarians have actually become much more of a factor
4794863 they win some local elections and the greens win some local elections in small towns but even in a state like georgia where hes most likely to do well i doubt he gets even 5 percent of the vote
4794864 theyre the greatest years america had they were the last years we balanced the budget until nixon if america knew that all of our problems were coming from alcohol they would go dry overnight again
4794865 hes running because this issue is so important to him
4794866 its an attempt to get an issue you care about and give it some life
4794867 i really see successful third parties as correctives to failures of the major parties
4794868 when a major party fails third parties serve as safety valves which alert the major parties about their failures and give them a chance to respond
4794869 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
4794870 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
4794871 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
4794872 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4794873 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4794874 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4794875 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4794876 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4794877 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
4794878 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
4794879 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4794880 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4794881 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
4794882 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
4794883 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
4794884 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
4794885 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4794886 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4794887 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4794888 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4794889 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4794890 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4794891 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4794892 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4794893 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4794894 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4794895 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4794896 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4794897 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4794898 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4794899 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4794900 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4794901 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4794902 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4794903 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4794904 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4794905 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4794906 what do you want your look to say to people
4794907 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4794908 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4794909 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4794910 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4794911 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4794912 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4794913 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4794914 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4794915 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4794916 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4794917 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4794918 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4794919 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4794920 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4794921 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4794922 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4794923 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4794924 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4794925 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4794926 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4794927 hed be a good man on a boat during a storm
4794928 obama does better against mccain with hunters and especially fisherpeople than did his two democratic predecessors vis a vis bush
4794929 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4794930 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4794931 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4794932 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4794933 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4794934 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4794935 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4794936 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4794937 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law
4794938 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4794939 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4794940 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4794941 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4794942 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4794943 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4794944 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4794945 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4794946 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4794947 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4794948 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who have crossed sarah
4794949 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4794950 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4794951 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4794952 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4794953 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4794954 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4794955 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4794956 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4794957 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4794958 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4794959 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4794960 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4794961 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4794962 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4794963 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4794964 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4794965 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4794966 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4794967 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4794968 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4794969 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4794970 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4794971 halal is relatively simple but industry and in particular the food industry has become increasingly complex and it has become progressively clearer that a new kind of discourse is needed to ensure that industrial producers remain within the parameters of syariah compliance
4794972 we came to chens residence and his office to investigate the case this morning the former president and his wife wu shu chen explained transactions of the funds

4794998 i hate the word fluke and since last year with my bronze medal my name has been associated with it
4794999 but shalane showed that the strength of u s running is no fluke
4795000 a guy in his stature what hes done in this league to be on a new team now it is going to be a media circus for that game
4795001 i dont know how im going to react when i see brett favre in a jets uniform
4795002 i fully expect our sideline to all be standing up
4795003 if we let down at all he could still throw the ball and the plays that he does know hell know how to execute them
4795004 hes only going to be in there for a bit so the fun will be over very quickly the festive like atmosphere will be over very quickly im getting ready for a game and our players have to do the same
4795005 we know who he is and his credibility in the league but its preseason and its not like we game plan
4795006 its definitely cool to play a hall of fame quarterback it will be interesting getting out there with the gunslinger
4795007 yeh im so going to buy a mountain bike seat extender for my grandmother too
4795008 the roth center lights our path it offers magnificent support for jewish life but it also teaches us that when rightful attention and respect are paid to the needs and strengths of each community within the whole the whole itself is strengthened dartmouth would be vastly diminished were this center not here
4795009 interdisciplinary work is invigorating and offers opportunities for originality at the boundaries between disciplines interdisciplinary thinking permeates our curriculum and dartmouth faculty members have been innovators in both interdisciplinary research and teaching
4795010 even going back to the 1950s president john sloan dickey sought to embed interdisciplinary thinking into dartmouths curriculum
4795011 the creative energy going into adding faculty and developing curriculum in cross cutting areas the digital humanities computational arts computational science ethics security studies policy studies sustainability science architecture urban studies and design and international studies is extraordinary
4795012 our history of innovation and success in interdisciplinary teaching and research places dartmouth at the leading edge of this mode of teaching and learning
4795013 dartmouth has a distinguished history of international and global thinking faculty from across the college share a sharp focus on international study research and deepening global understanding
4795014 nowhere is our leadership in this area more obvious than in our off campus programs
4795015 for todays dartmouth to become a truly global dartmouth will require strategic thinking not only about the cultural skills and competencies students of the new century require but also other types of knowledge and experiences they will need to prepare them for success and leadership in a global world
4795016 the most effective way to teach this is to place students with scholars who are themselves creating new knowledge art literature and working on complex and demanding problems
4795017 our challenge now is to find new ways to incorporate learning by doing practice with critical theory independent study and the tools of research across the curriculum
4795018 it is clear from the communitys input that we share a commitment to dartmouths mission to educate the most promising students and prepare them for a lifetime of learning and of responsible leadership through a faculty dedicated to teaching and the creation of knowledge
4795019 you have reminded us of dartmouths responsibility to educate leaders for a global society in which the challenges in our own times are as great or greater than those that led former dartmouth president john sloan dickey to tell the incoming class in 1946 the worlds troubles are your troubles
4795020 after interviewing several firms isaacson miller emerged as our clear choice
4795021 john isaacson knows dartmouth well and will bring tremendous wisdom to the search
4795022 i benefited so much from my colleagues and from how good the dartmouth students are
4795023 they just kept asking really thoughtful hard questions and they made me develop a view i could defend
4795024 what if a medical computer was proven to be more accurate than doctors would you trust it to save your life
4795025 sometimes we forget that philosophy is a living breathing debatable controversial and relevant topic
4795026 we hoped to provide a forum for students to wrestle with their own ideas
4795027 our class provides that link for the class of 2008 we connect them to the past but we can also start them thinking forward to their 50th reunion in 2058
4795028 the 58s and the 08s will be the first classes to have had this formal connection from freshman to senior year
4795029 in fact some 58s raided the 08 doc trips and cooked them meals in a cabin
4795030 it has been an absolute pleasure to get to spend time with the 58s and their spouses
4795031 i have received some of my best life advice from the 58s
4795032 theres no question that the class of 1958 is an inspirational model for us
4795033 i hope that i can have as lasting an impact on the class of 2058s dartmouth experience
4795034 our first year seminar program has long served as a leader among colleges and universities around the country
4795035 but faculty from all disciplines at the college felt that we could and should do even more to enhance our students critical communication skills the expanded course offerings and the cross fertilization of writing with speech is designed to provide dartmouth students with an exceptional opportunity to develop vital skills that will last them a lifetime
4795036 congratulations and thanks to our outstanding and hardworking staff board members contributors and of course our readers special thanks to a college administration that values an editorially independent alumni magazine
4795037 exhibit academic excellence demonstrate leadership skills and commit to health and well being
4795038 theres an opportunity for me to do that but usually i try to get ahead in my work so it doesnt pile up when i have a lot of training to do
4795039 with training sometimes you can feel good but sometimes you can just feel really tired and its hard to do work so its good to stay a little ahead
4795040 once in a while my parents would drag me out but i complained a lot
4795041 i realized i was actually good at this and decided to apply myself
4795042 i wanted to keep getting better because i knew there was the possibility that i could be really really good
4795043 the chance to study with some of the brightest minds in chinese paleography as well as the opportunity to live in china for a year
4795044 developing friendships with people who have lived very different lives from my own
4795045 in how people try to control their own lives when faced with limiting structural conditions they cannot control like government policies or racism
4795046 how muslims conceive of themselves and are conceived as citizens in germany and as a religious community in the public space
4795047 i hope to combine my interest in literature with my passion for gender studies as a professor i want to reach students like myself to challenge them to explore new cultures and ideas and to expand their visions of what they believe they can achieve
4795048 the village where my family is from was the first alaskan native village to use the icwa
4795049 throughout the 1940s 50s 60s and 70s a much larger portion of indian and alaskan native children were taken away from their homes more than any other race and often with very little reason they were nearly always sent away to a non native family usually in a different state
4795050 that describe the world students and faculty experience at dartmouth today the campus is exploding with their energy and optimism
4795051 we feel privileged by the students who come to dartmouth to study with us
4795052 before they even come to campus they have shown a passion for learning
4795053 our students should have learning experiences that are personalized and flexible
4795054 we want them to study with scholars from many different backgrounds in the arts and sciences and also increasingly with faculty from the
4795055 students and faculty work together to create new discoveries in all fields works of art music poetry they design new materials and computational tools they develop policy papers critically analyze theories and work toward new syntheses experiences that take students beyond classroom learning to being a person of that discipline
4795056 seasons often stand out for exceptional talent or exceptional leadership and this year we had both
4795057 the captains russell young 08 and damon wright 08 had a huge impact
4795058 those were grueling games mentally and physically when we ended the weekend with a split we knew had a shot at winning the conference
4795059 it was the most enjoyable and exciting year that i have been a part of
4795060 the only hostile environment in the ivy league for opposing teams
4795061 the member of the graduating class who has been four years in attendance who has been the best all around athlete regard also being had to moral worth and high standing in scholarship
4795062 to one male and one female of the junior class who have combined outstanding performance in athletics and significant achievement in academics
4795063 the team started its season the day after last season ended they documented their aspirations and how they were going to go about enjoying the competition it was long haul but a tremendous experience
4795064 in the ivies we stepped onto the field like we were the rightful champions and then played in a manner to prove it
4795065 i had the privilege of serving on the deans council when jim wright was dean of the faculty and the presidents leadership council before going on the board jims vision for the college closely mirrors my own to make dartmouth the best it can be
4795066 how to stay competitive in the sciences while expending necessary resources elsewhere in the college
4795067 these endowments are made to honor the memory of my grandparents sir edwin and lady manton
4795068 i have fond memories of studying in the reserve reading room as a student at dartmouth because the space was made so much more alive by the murals our gift reflects my familys appreciation of the importance of the work and my grandparents lifelong support of the arts
4795069 i admired sir edwin immensely and i am so pleased that the manton foundation has made this generous gift in his memory
4795070 at dartmouth we stress a hands on experiential approach to learning whether its in the humanities the sciences or social sciences generations of students have studied the orozco murals or studied under them in baker library this gift will not only safeguard and promote one of our cherished artworks but will help advance our digital media program which is a major priority for the college
4795071 this is a piece by gliere called the russian sailors dance
4795072 if youre old enough to remember that movie then youre very old
4795073 the men of my generation always stood when the alma mater was played and we always will
4795074 this was really relaxing its so perfect to have something like this during finals
4795075 were now relying on the collective wisdom of this leadership
4795076 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation we will do all we can to help
4795077 finally to make fully clear to robert mugabe that a new government in zimbabwe that must reflect the will of the zimbabwean population is necessary
4795078 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery

4795081 wir gehen mit geldern von kapitalgebern z b pensionsfonds diese sind oft gutgl ubig und hinterfragen nicht die herkunft unserer ber 20 prozentigen renditen in verschiedene l nder dort akquirieren wir von banken versicherungen etc npl s
4795082 unser interesse ist nicht die kredite ber bis zu 20 jahre lang einzutreiben sondern uns geht es um die m glichst schnelle verwertung der sicherheiten nach ca 4 jahren gehen wir dann in ein anderes land und es verbleibt nur eine kleine verwertungs und abwicklungsgesellschaft
4795083 damit wir die sicherheiten ver u ern k nnen arbeiten wir m glichst schnell auf eine k ndigung der zugrunde liegenden kreditvertr ge hin z b durch hohe zins und ratenforderungen auch r ckwirkend die der kreditnehmer nicht realisieren kann als wege der realisierung der forderungen bedienen wir uns zum einen der zwangsversteigerung aber sie ist nicht in jedem fall der beste weg denn viel h here erl se werfen sekund re ver u erungswege wie ber renommierte maklerfirmen und einzelmakler ab beiden bedienen wir uns massiv damit die immobilien so schnell wie m glich verkauft werden k nnen denn wir haben nicht viel zeit um ihnen eine vorstellung zu geben das sind im moment 320 maklerfirmen in ganz deutschland au erdem nutzen wir auch das internet z b immobilienscout24 um die immobilien so schnell als m glich zu verkaufen
4795084 wir verwerten die sicherheiten viel eher als eine bank tun w rde und stellen dem immobilienbesitzer viel h here geb hren in rechnung als ihre vormaligen banken
4795085 sie k nnen unsere firma nicht angreifen denn alles was wir machen ist zu 100 prozent legal gesetzlich jedenfalls moralisch ist es anders jedoch stimmen in einzelnen f llen die berechnungen der zinsen nicht doch daf r muss man finanzmathematiker sein um dass nachrechnen zu k nnen
4795086 wenn sie etwas gegen so eine heuschrecke unternehmen m chten und ihre immobilien sch tzen und behalten m chten bleibt ihnen nur der weg potentielle k ufer aufzukl ren kl ren sie sie auf was es mit immobilien die von diesen heuschrecken direkt und indirekt vertrieben werden auf sich hat
4795087 niemand sollte solche h user wohnungen und grundst cke kaufen denn sie stammen immer aus einer art enteignung eines ehrlichen sparers der durch die heuschrecke um sein hab und gut sein ganzes verm gen gebracht wird f r mich ist das eine art betrug und damit organisierte kriminalit t und damit m chte ich nichts mehr zu tun haben wenn die sicherheiten immobilien nicht mehr verkauft werden k nnen bricht das ganze gesch ftsmodell in sich zusammen und hnliche unternehmen werden schneller in ein anderes land gehen
4795088 ausserdem sollten sie potenzielle arbeitnehmer auf die zwielichtigen aktivit ten unserer nlp verwerter hinweisen damit sie nicht wie ich f r ein unternehmen anfangen zu arbeiten was sie kurze zeit sp ter bereuen wir schalten viel werbung bei vielen jobb rsen und portalen

4795099 if you flood people with noise and move towards them it increases their physical threat as the brain is subjected to a multi sensory impact
4795100 this does not evoke sympathy because there is acute threat and instead the reflective part of the brain is shutdown and you cant reason that it is not real
4795101 the extreme noise causes the brain to feel confused and i know some people who would be tipped over the edge from this show your reaction has been similar to that of a trauma victim
4795102 this is a violent very brutal and noisy show and people have found it too much and left

4795105 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
4795106 its the hardest decision ive had to make in my political life
4795107 id love to have done it but the simple truth is that i cant physically afford to move up there from west wales with my five children and give the seat my full time commitment
4795108 ive not been able to find a job since losing my seat in the welsh assembly a year ago and i dont have a pot of gold so i cant just go off and do what i want people dont like to employ ex politicians especially labour ones like me who might unionise
4795109 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
4795110 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
4795111 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
4795112 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
4795113 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
4795114 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
4795115 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
4795116 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
4795117 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
4795118 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
4795119 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
4795120 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
4795121 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
4795122 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
4795123 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
4795124 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
4795125 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
4795126 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
4795127 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
4795128 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
4795129 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
4795130 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
4795131 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
4795132 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
4795133 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
4795134 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
4795135 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
4795136 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
4795137 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
4795138 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
4795139 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
4795140 the 65 000 new donors to the obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the american people are looking to fundamentally change business as usual in washington we are proud of the millions of volunteers and more than two million donors to the obama campaign who will provide the backbone of our campaign to put america back on track and reject the old politics and failed bush policies which is all john mccain is offering
4795141 this is an impeccably crafted work by one of the most widely respected anthropologists of his generation i am quite confident that it will become not only the standard reference on the cultural study of alcoholism in mexico but also one of the very best overall social science contributions to the study of mexican culture produced in the last fifty years
4795142 he would rather sit down to a meal with an entertaining acrobat than a tedious duke

4795148 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4795149 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4795150 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4795151 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4795152 i have never heard of what youre talking about i will put my hand on a bible
4795153 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
4795154 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
4795155 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
4795156 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
4795157 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
4795158 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement
4795159 what possible difference could it make it was all 25 years ago

4795198 it sounds perfect and everybody working there has a certain air about them its an incredible environment to work in
4795199 nah you just run the same way ive been booed since i got in this sport so it hasnt really changed much
4795200 i tell you last week impressed the heck out of me
4795201 last week he beat one of the best there is out there in tony stewart he was solid all day long that shows me what kind of team they have and what kind of driver kyle is
4795202 i have worked with him as a teammate and have always know that he is a special special talent
4795203 i told him a couple of years ago once you figure out how to win you arent going to stop but you have to stop knocking the right sides off you cars and crashing in practice and taking unnecessary risks he has figured that out this year and he has been on fire i feel the same thing about championship form once he understands how to win a championship he is going to be tough to beat each and every year

4795209 you dont have to bring him back if its healing well
4795210 the vet wants to know if your cat has ever had an idiosyncratic reaction to tranquilizers before
4795211 thats the last thing id say he wresisted the tranquilizer and he riled up every animal in the building you heard it in there you hear anything now
4795212 apparently only for you he should still be sleeping off the anesthesia but here he is wide awake and alert ready to rip my head off if i move the wrong way
4795213 a dose of a little more than a teaspoonful of ether will produce a condition of inebriation lasting from one half to one hour but the dose must soon be greatly increased the after effects are if anything rather pleasant and the habit of ether drinking is certainly not so injurious as alcoholism
4795214 but if you had one of these mutations even as a 20 year old i would be concerned
4795215 i would say ive got some new strengths on the interior line
4795216 it could have been kind of predictable last year but hopefully ill get some change ups and weve got some new guys inside that we could definitely do more things with theres more possibilities
4795217 ive been working on a couple of different things and trying out some things some of it ill keep some of it ill probably throw away hopefully once we get into a game and i use them well see how it works
4795218 you do definitely need counters to moves that would be considered your key move
4795219 believers to sign with their blood an oath of allegiance to the imam mahdi
4795220 businesses needing help keeping their computer network safe and secure
4795221 they played a good ballgame and just did things when they needed to a little bit better than we did
4795222 i really didnt think about the home run too much
4795223 as far as them all being doubles or better thats extremely surprising ill keep trying but i doubt its going to last long but its been fun so far
4795224 we cant have a television or radio on in the store but we do bring in whatever we can find on the results after the fact
4795225 weve been looking forward to actually being able to watch her for a very long time
4795226 she would just go out there and have a good time
4795227 an arms race that few can even hope to compete in much less win
4795228 embracing open source development crowd sourcing content targeting different platforms such as the web or mobile phones all of these are valid
4795229 they arent responding to the changing market because they dont understand how to work things like web technologies into their current income models
4795230 so instead they keep doing the same things just more of them and with higher budgets
4795231 if it wasnt done the reality is he would be a college senior and this is the last big year with the leverage
4795232 i was a last second signing myself at the deadline so i kind of know what hes going through
4795233 i wasnt as advanced as he is i was deciding on which college to go to and i was deciding which sport to play
4795234 at the last minute i signed for pro ball after all those decisions
4795235 thats why they sent me to double a because that was the only league that was left at the time basically
4795236 we talked briefly im hoping we get it done most of thats out of my hands
4795237 i aint a lawyer dont ask me that my mom wanted me to be a lawyer thats too much school
4795238 the way our outfield is playing and jeff keppinger is playing every day
4795239 its the way i saw jerry moving at short compared to the outfield well have kepp back in there tomorrow and the next day
4795240 we dont have the power but we have more speed we have at any given time three to four center fielders in the outfield
4795241 we have more speed on the bases we can go first to third you manage more for contact were not waiting for a three run homer
4795242 they know each other on the field which is more important than the locker next to a guy
4795243 i think it probably helps them feel more comfortable being in the big leagues too
4795244 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4795245 a ver otra vez por favor que yo s lo he entendido el que
4795246 is really going to hurt the olympics parks were full at all times
4795247 the other two guys in the threesome were struggling on that hole especially around the green and i had probably five to 10 minutes before putting
4795248 i just really tried to see it going in the hole over and over again
4795249 i called him and told him id hopefully be joining him down there
4795250 sure enough i sent him a text message after i qualified and said see you down there
4795251 robs game has matured enough now that when he needs to make birdies when he needs to score he makes it happen
4795252 hes such a competitor he truly just wills the ball into the hole its an amazing thing to watch
4795253 he doesnt show virtually any emotion on the golf course and i think thats a huge advantage for him that keeps his emotions in check and it can also be intimidating for his opponents
4795254 its so nice to see their hard work being rewarded
4795255 i feel freelancing should be a path not a destination
4795256 you can only make as much money as you can literally work at one time
4795257 in the ongoing battle with the mpaa and riaa there seems to be an ongoing argument about who is to blame
4795258 an eye for an eye will make the whole world blind
4795259 we built gigantic buildings to kiss the sky we build gargantuan bridges to span the seas through our spaceships we were able to carve highways through the stratosphere through our airplanes we were able to dwarf distance and place time in chains through our submarines we were able to penetrate oceanic depths
4795260 even though youve done all of that i was hungry and you fed me not i was naked and ye clothed me not the children of my sons and daughters were in need of economic security and you didnt provide for them so you cannot enter the kingdom of greatness
4795261 if you do it unto the least of these my brethren you do it unto me
4795262 we are tired of smothering in an air tight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society we are tired of walking up the streets in search for jobs that do not exist we are tired of working our hands off and laboring every day and not even making a wage adequate with daily basic necessities of life we are tired of our men being emasculated so that our wives and our daughters have to go out and work in the white ladies kitchens cleaning up unable to be with our children to give them the time and the attention that they need we are tired
4795263 youre my man and im going to do the right thing for you if youll just come back on the job
4795264 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
4795265 we know that that check shouldnt have bounced because you have the resources in the federal treasury
4795266 you are even unjustly spending five hundred thousand dollars to kill a single vietcong soldier while you spend only fifty three dollars a year per person for everybody categorized as poverty stricken
4795267 is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there
4795268 there is a balm in gilead to make the wounded whole there is a balm in gilead to heal the sin sick soul
4795269 those guys are the best in the world and watching what they do to prepare for a big tournament watching how they warm up every day and play their practice rounds hopefully that experience should make it easier next week to not get overwhelmed about how big the u s amateur is
4795270 being at the u s open it doesnt get any bigger than that
4795271 he basically did the opposite of what we asked him to do
4795272 campbell was telling me to just go at him go at him go at him
4795273 im not that type of fighter if i do that im going to take big punches my dad told me to call him as soon as im done i feel like i let him down
4795274 we even put money on their phone so we can get in touch with them and they call home what happens is they get instructions all the way from the united states and you can tell the difference because once the bell rings they start to do other things
4795275 i didnt even know id got the record till i did my victory lap
4795276 when we conceded the one goal we all just looked at each other and just regained our composure and stood tall and pushed forward
4795277 then we went back on the attack and executed some really nice penalty corners
4795278 the skipper barber put the hand up thank goodness and made the save thats as good as knocking another one in at the other end i was very proud of the way they defended that final corner
4795279 im a little bitter that i lifted 10 kg 22 1 pounds heavier before the competition
4795280 i am a big girl but thats a lot of weight
4795281 with over a hundred gods in my pantheon i can always find one when i need to and theres no waiting
4795282 whether its the homey glow of vespas eternal flame the whimsical mirth of loki or the howling blood lust of mars i can always get what i want with polytheism
4795283 we believe that the netwrok of simi was behind the blasts indian mujahideen which claimed the responsibility of the blasts is connected to simi
4795284 today is the big day for gujarat police which has been able to crack the ahmedabad blasts case
4795285 the planning of the blasts was done in ahmedabad by simi joint commissioner of police of city crime branch ashish bhatia who is heading the inquiry said
4795286 all three of her daughters including elisabeth mccutcheon a former volleyball olympian have also returned to the united states
4795287 you know what i do is sit on the sideline and fire up the boys
4795288 i think it was comforting just getting back in the normal rhythm of the team all teams have a culture and im certainly a part of ours so it was great to be back into the game and get going again
4795289 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states
4795290 i think i wanted the medal more than the others thats why i won
4795291 ive been here before just taking part but today i came for the gold
4795292 in the heptathlon you have to take the good with the bad the bad with the good and ive had a lot of that this week
4795293 that is all in the past i made a mistake but i returned
4795294 those who say i should be banned should look in the mirror
4795295 he was actually the one that kind of calmed me down at the end of that hungary match
4795296 i was looking at him in the crowd he just told me to stay calm focus
4795297 shes had such a tough year with my mom and me being sick and having to deal with all that and really not having any time for herself
4795298 now she can really relax and enjoy the rest of the olympic experience
4795299 theyre exceptionally tall so to try to get touches on them can be extremely difficult
4795300 i dont think we even expected this to turn out as it did
4795301 we were the underdogs going into all of our matches some other countries didnt expect us to be as strong as we were
4795302 last time around my parents they knew how close keeth was one point
4795303 this is what they wanted they wanted us to finally medal it feels like a family medal to me

4795312 cos a sibling knows that he she is never really alone
4795313 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4795314 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4795315 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4795316 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4795317 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4795318 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4795319 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4795320 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4795321 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4795322 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4795323 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4795324 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4795325 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4795326 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4795327 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4795328 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4795329 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4795330 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4795331 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4795332 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4795333 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4795334 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4795335 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4795336 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4795337 with over a hundred gods in my pantheon i can always find one when i need to and theres no waiting
4795338 whether its the homey glow of vespas eternal flame the whimsical mirth of loki or the howling blood lust of mars i can always get what i want with polytheism
4795339 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4795340 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4795341 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4795342 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4795343 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4795344 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4795345 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4795346 who are open to doing something on the production side
4795347 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4795348 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4795349 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4795350 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4795351 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4795352 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4795353 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4795354 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4795355 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4795356 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4795357 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4795358 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4795359 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4795360 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4795361 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4795362 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4795363 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4795364 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4795365 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4795366 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4795367 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4795368 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4795369 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4795370 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4795371 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4795372 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4795373 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4795374 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4795375 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4795376 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4795377 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4795378 to me i cant think of another word than exciting
4795379 its exciting and fires me up that people think that about our program the football world thinks weve got a shot and holds us in high esteem thats a very good positive statement for georgia football
4795380 i told them what i said to you almost verbatim its exciting its an honor and theres a responsibility that goes with it
4795381 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4795382 and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers

4795385 additional security measures taken by the russian peacekeeping contingent which will be strengthened as these measures of addition security are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4795386 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4795387 there questions are not decided by condoleezza rice or somebody else they are decided first of all by the side that has suffered in the conflict
4795388 what peacekeepers from what countries are needed for the people of south ossetia to feel comfortable is a primarily up to the people of south ossetia
4795389 to be honest id felt i was a little bit too far back
4795390 but now i would definitely think about changing my schedule because i was going to take next week off

4795405 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4795406 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

4795423 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4795424 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4795425 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

4795428 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4795429 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4795430 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4795431 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4795432 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4795433 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4795434 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4795435 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4795436 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4795437 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4795438 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4795439 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4795457 it feels good to be here to be part of history

4795547 this here a song is about john w smoke junior its about bein in love and lovin the love thats hatin the love the love and the love and the hate thats lovin with all its around the love thats hate thats the hate thats the love and the love is the love that is the hate thats hatin the love its lovin the hate its about john w smokes mom its with his mom its about his mom its about his mom its about lovin his mom and bein without his mom and lovin the hate thats hatin the love and his mom and all the time theyre there hatin the hate thats lovin the hate its love its the love thats hate and it goes somethin about like this john e smoke oh john e smoke john smoke oh john e smoke whaoh john e smoke john e john e john e john john john smoke john e smoke here we go john john was a little crippled midget lesbian boy but he stood ten foot tall with a knife pretty soon the mole had appeared on johns left leg and rope like it extended out 469 different miles and verily verily it was 69 different nuns speaking simultaneously to john in 69 different languages and then it evolved itself and it was the legless dog that become a cyclone out of johns fathers fore head and there it was like a twinkie with a halo storm in it and it revolved down into the sky and talked to john like he was a little puppy himself and john said that i am not the magma i am not the crust and i shall evolve when the rain had come down here and washed on john and he said that i will be a cigarette butt before its all done with and they said no you are the flame itself and you shall burn pure in the south american sky where the blooddogs worship the stairway
4795548 why did you come to a party if you dont want to dance
4795549 the media hasnt really gotten on board with the whole global war on terrorism issue
4795550 iraq war it is a front in a global war people think that if we just up and go that well be happy and safe at home and the reality is that thats probably not true these psychos are everywhere in the world and we are going to have to find them and get them everywhere in the world if the bullets stopped flying in iraq today my guess is that wed be off to somewhere else real soon to fight the same war against the same enemy on a different front during world war ii there were many fronts but you didnt see politicians protesting the war in japan or women chaining themselves to the white houses fence because theyre son died on iwo jima they understood that we were fighting a battle that needed to be fought and because we were the only ones that could do it it wasnt about american pride or arrogance or money it was much simpler than that bad people in charge equals a bad world i am not bragging about the us military as i will occasionally do i am merely stating a fact that we have the largest most hi tech sophisticated fighting force on the planet and as such it is our moral obligation to fight the bad guys in this war thats in my opinion why we came here in the first place and why well go on to the next front when it pops up
4795551 the world is a dangerous place to live not because of the people who are evil but because of the people who dont do anything about it
4795552 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body
4795553 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4795554 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
4795555 we go into the fall if nothing else a tested organization
4795556 this is like a high stakes trapeze act that these guys have because mistakes and gaffes matter oh so much in these contests
4795557 he has the energy and the forward looking vision to lead
4795558 he has to deal with the ghost on the stage and probably has to do that in a dramatic way
4795559 people will be looking for obama to demonstrate a mastery of the questions
4795560 keeping him on an even keel at all times and not letting the situation rattle him in any way
4795561 he very seldom lets his emotions get the better of him which i think is very helpful
4795562 is a very nuanced thinker and thats good but sometimes in the expression of that it bogs him down a little bit so hes not as direct a speaker or performer as the best debaters have been
4795563 you bring a young kid up to play and youre basically hoping that he makes the plays and knows how to play the game and things like that
4795564 all of a sudden it seems like hes getting a big hit every time he comes up and there seems to be men on base and his production has been off the charts its been a welcome addition in maybe an area where you dont have a right to expect that much its been great
4795565 i just think thats the type of hitter he is
4795566 i think it bodes well especially if youre a left handed hitter at fenway if you have the ability to hit that wall
4795567 were now relying on the collective wisdom of this leadership
4795568 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation we will do all we can to help
4795569 finally to make fully clear to robert mugabe that a new government in zimbabwe that must reflect the will of the zimbabwean population is necessary
4795570 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery
4795571 serious blot on the culture of democracy in our subregion
4795572 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4795573 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4795574 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4795575 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4795576 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4795577 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4795578 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4795579 we do not believe that the baby that the 3 year old is dead
4795580 we believe that she casey misplaced her did something wrong but we dont believe that shes dead however if it turns up that something happened nothing is lost it means shes going to be under 24 hour surveillance
4795581 abbiamo giocato un tennis fantastico e ci siamo meritati questo risultato ed stato anche pi divertente vincere in due perch hai qualcuno con cui condividere la gioia eppoi cos ho dimostrato a me stesso che gran doppista sono anche se in passato non ho giocato molto la specialit vivo un momento davvero grande nella mia carriera
4795582 non pensavo che saremmo stati testa di serie fra tutte quelle coppie inusuali che cerano al via ce ne siamo avvantaggiati
4795583 the latest super duper hollywood flick and how it is better than all others
4795584 it is one of the blessings of old friends that you can afford to be stupid with them
4795585 to the ancients friendship seemed the happiest and most fully human of all loves the crown of life and the school of virtue the modern world in comparison ignores it we admit of course that besides a wife and family a man needs a few friends but the very tone of the admission and the sort of acquaintanceships which those who make it would describe as friendships show clearly that what they are talking about has very little to do with that philia which aristotle classified among the virtues or that amicitia on which cicero wrote a book
4795586 my dear friend if you are reading this know that i cherish our friendship you gave me the best and the most beautiful moments of my life i still admire your patience to put up with me for hours and to put a smile on my face

4795592 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4795593 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4795594 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4795595 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados

4795597 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4795598 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4795599 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4795600 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4795601 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4795602 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4795603 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4795604 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4795605 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4795606 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4795607 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4795608 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4795609 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4795610 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4795611 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4795612 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4795613 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4795614 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4795615 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4795616 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4795617 la mejor forma de honrar la memoria de esta gran mujer es continuar y fortalecer su legado el ministerio de cultura mantendr su apoyo al festival iberoamericano de teatro que en 20 a os se convirti en uno de los eventos culturales m s importantes del mundo gracias a la labor de esta pionera
4795618 fanny mikey nos demostr a trav s de su vida y obra que el arte y la cultura pueden movilizar a la sociedad colombiana gracias a su importante labor colombia se mostr ante el mundo a trav s del festival iberoamericano de teatro y del teatro nacional entre otras de sus obras como un pa s diverso e infinitamente creativo fanny fue una artista con visi n empresarial que nunca perdi el amor y la pasi n por el teatro y que siempre busc la excelencia la competitividad y la cohesi n social
4795619 las artes esc nicas del pa s tuvieron en fanny mikey un gran motor y un gran aliento de vida fanny fue el amalgama de una serie de polos opuestos que rara vez se van a volver a dar una gran actriz que necesitaba de las tablas una gestora y administradora excepcional y una mujer sensible y en rgica que nos deja un legado muy grande no solo a los artistas sino a todos los colombianos
4795620 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4795621 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4795622 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

4795627 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4795628 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4795629 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4795630 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4795631 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4795632 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4795633 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4795634 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4795635 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4795636 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4795637 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4795638 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4795639 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4795640 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4795641 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4795642 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4795643 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4795644 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4795645 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4795646 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4795647 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4795648 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4795649 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4795650 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4795651 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4795652 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4795653 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4795654 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4795655 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4795656 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
4795657 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
4795658 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
4795659 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
4795660 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
4795661 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
4795662 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4795663 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4795664 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4795665 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4795666 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4795667 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4795668 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4795669 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4795670 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4795671 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4795672 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4795673 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4795674 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4795675 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4795677 it is a great pleasure to celebrate the accomplishments of these faculty members
4795678 they each enrich the lives of our students and the intellectual vitality of our campus with their scholarship creativity and personal drive i congratulate them all
4795679 it goes without saying that being named to an endowed chair is an honor but the daniel webster professor how could any member of dartmouths faculty not be thrilled to be named to that particular chair
4795680 in keeping with what i consider to be the dartmouth ideal my teaching and research remain closely connected and mutually reinforcing when i edited five shakespeare plays and the narrative poems for the pelican shakespeare a few years ago undergraduate research and editorial assistants were crucial to the project i look forward to working with them again
4795681 in my advanced seminar in international economics i expose my students to cutting edge research on financial crises and they undertake a major research project in each of the last five years three to five of my seminar students have been among the 50 chosen in a national competition to present their work at carroll round an undergraduate economics research conference held at georgetown university they return to dartmouth energized about economics and economic research
4795682 we met in classrooms and thats where it began learning and living took place discussion questioning challenging are part of the vehicle through office hours there was room for personal instruction my role was to help the student through the thinking process not to impose or propose but to keep the student thinking
4795683 i derive a lot of satisfaction from research collaborations with my where teaching and research come together in a unique way its very gratifying to be a part of the process of helping talented students mature as thinkers and writers
4795684 one delightful feature of my current project has been the opportunity to involve the james o freedman presidential scholars classics majors leslie shribman 09 karen laakko 10 brian howe 11 and john kee 11 have all been instrumental in fine tuning the translation and adding student friendly notes
4795685 i enjoy it when students questions take my research in unexpected directions for example stacie payne 09 was a student in my spring term emotion course in which we studied how explicit choices can be implicitly affected by emotional cues in the environment stacie is interested in the law and will write an honors thesis assessing whether implicit priming of emotional neural systems can affect jurors explicit guilty not guilty verdicts
4795686 this award is deeply gratifying not least because of how it honors karen wetterhahns inspiring example wetterhahn was professor of chemistry and the albert bradley third century professor in the sciences she co founded the women in science project wisp and was founding director of dartmouths toxic metals research program i look forward to continuing to teach cultural and intellectual history and to developing new research on the nuanced historical development of anglo american liberal feminism
4795687 i have always been grateful to the professors who served as wonderful teachers and mentors during my student years this award embodies what they conveyed to me about teaching and supporting students as well as my desire to pass on their passion and love for history literature and knowledge they simultaneously inspired and challenged me over the years i hope that in some small way i too have been able to create such moments with my own students
4795688 i firmly believe that students benefit significantly from participating in the research and scholarship activities of our faculty the integration of research experience and classroom learning is important for the development of critical thinking skills as well as a comprehensive understanding of subject material in turn i learn a great deal from the undergraduates who work in my laboratory
4795689 the medical community has lost a faithful advocate and dartmouth has lost a loyal friend

4795739 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence

4795748 what do you want to be when you grow up
4795749 the us army developed high grade weaponised anthrax in order it said to work out what would happen if someone else did the same no one else was capable of producing it the terrorist who posted envelopes of anthrax in 2001 took it from one of the armys laboratories now us researchers are preparing genetically modified strains of smallpox on the same pretext and with the same likely consequences
4795750 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
4795751 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
4795752 and despite continued white house denials four well placed and separate sources have told abc news that initial tests on the anthrax by the us army at fort detrick maryland have detected trace amounts of the chemical additives bentonite and silica
4795753 the discovery of bentonite came in an urgent series of tests conducted at fort detrick maryland and elsewhere
4795754 this news about bentonite as the additive being a trademark of the iraqi biological weapons program is very significant partly because theres been a lot of pressure on the bush administration inside and out to go after saddam hussein and some are going to be quick to pick up on this as a smoking gun
4795755 on the critical issue of who sent the anthrax its time to give credit to the abc website abcnews com for reporting rings around most other news organizations heres a bit from a comprehensive story filed late last week by gary matsumoto lending further credence to the commonsensical theory resisted by the white house that al qaeda or iraq and not some domestic ted kaczynski type is behind the germ warfare
4795756 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
4795757 there is also tremendous evidence that subsequent anthrax attacks are connected to iraq
4795758 the iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade
4795759 im not sure if panic is quite the right word but it is close enough anthrax played a role in my decision to support the bush administrations desire to take out saddam hussein i linked him to anthrax which i linked to sept 11 i was not going to stand by and simply wait for another attack more attacks i was going to go to the source hussein and get him before he could get us as time went on i became more and more questioning but i had a hard time backing down from my initial whoop and holler for war
4795760 anthrax remember anthrax it seems no one does anymore at least its never mentioned but right after the terrorist attacks of sept 11 2001 letters laced with anthrax were received at the new york post and tom brokaws office at nbc there was ample reason to be afraid
4795761 the attacks were not entirely unexpected i had been told soon after sept 11 to secure cipro the antidote to anthrax the tip had come in a roundabout way from a high government official and i immediately acted on it i was carrying cipro way before most people had ever heard of it
4795762 for this and other reasons the anthrax letters appeared linked to the awful events of sept
4795763 in the following days as the horror started to be airbrushed no more bodies plummeting to the sidewalk the anthrax letters started to come some to people i knew
4795764 that more or less is how i made my decision to support the war in iraq
4795765 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
4795766 today we frequently admonish people who oppose abortion euthanasia assisted suicide or capital punishment to keep their religious moral and philosophical beliefs to themselves
4795767 before dispensing such admonishments in the future perhaps we should gratefully consider some of our countrys most courageous historical figures who refused to do so
4795768 rabbi morris kosman is entirely correct in summarily rejecting the demands of the frederick imam for a dialogue
4795769 by blood and faith jews are gods chosen and have no need for dialogue with any gentile
4795770 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
4795771 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
4795772 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
4795773 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab
4795774 i believe in 10 years we would ask why didnt we do this it will be 10 times more expensive and the cost of gas will be unaffordable
4795775 we have to compete for talent and for place of national prominence
4795776 resolution in support of a four lane project for state hwy 133 from albany to valdosta this is the same resolution that was before
4795777 were just engineers and software people out of silicon valley with mortgages to pay and kids in school but we want to do something besides sell products to the west more than just the next gizmo that goes on a cell phone
4795778 true we never have all the facts when doing a case study but it is instructive to imagine ourselves as the executives and board members in a situation and ask ourselves what obvious mistakes we seem to have made what might have been the extenuating circumstances and whether we should really be forgiven for the mistake even given those imagined constraints
4795779 timing a prestigious sporting event gives real credibility to our brand
4795780 my small team who i picked myself is 100 trustworthy
4795781 no employee can be trusted and well make sure they never get anything over on us
4795782 true we never have all the facts when doing a case study but it is instructive to imagine ourselves as the executives and board members in a situation and ask ourselves what obvious mistakes we seem to have made what might have been the extenuating circumstances and whether we should really be forgiven for the mistake even given those imagined constraints

4795789 making that connection is absolutely in bounds and we would be remiss if we didnt
4795790 we werent going to win every game for the rest of the year so we have to regroup and try to come back out and win tonight
4795791 when youre going against a guy like webb its going to be tough anyway we just didnt play well
4795792 the way im going every home run feels kind of special right now so i cant really say that one feels extra special
4795793 obviously it was a good game webby was great and it was sure nice to get him a big lead and i was happy to be able to tack on
4795794 i was missing every pitch i threw i didnt know what was going to happen it was very difficult
4795795 just not a good night of attacking the strike zone wandy had problems putting it in the zone and didnt have his curveball either it was a tough night for him and when youre facing a guy like brandon webb its awfully tough
4795796 i was getting ahead of most of the hitters and if not i was coming right back and evening up the count i was pretty aggressive in the strike zone and i was able to keep the ball on the ground for the most part i dont know if it was my best outing but it was pretty good
4795797 he got through the second inning pretty good and we got one run in the bottom of the first half and i was like here we go

4795808 heute haben wir einige kleine probleme an den maschinen entdeckt
4795809 zu beginn habe ich nicht so viel riskiert weil ich gedacht habe dass die strecke so lange austrocknet aber stattdessen wurde es immer schlimmer und ich musste mich beim rest des qualifyings zu dem zeitpunkt reinh ngen als die strecke wie ein fluss aussah
4795810 gegen ende der session haben wir einen guten kompromiss gefunden der es mir erlaubt hat in die top 10 vorzusto en
4795811 heute hatten wir mit den streckenbedingungen nicht so viel gl ck wir dachten dass es von runde zu runde besser werden w rde aber der regen wurde immer st rker und hat unsere arbeit noch komplizierter gemacht

4795813 ein schwieriger tag f r uns mit diesen wetterbedingungen haben sich neue schwierigkeiten aufgetan und auch heute haben wir es nicht geschafft richtig schnell zu sein wir haben wohl einen strategischen fehler gemacht als wir zu beginn wo die strecke noch trocken war nicht genug runden gefahren sind wir haben von sylvain unter diesen umst nden etwas mehr erwartet der bei solchen streckenverh ltnissen immer sehr schnell war aber auch er hatte heute mit problemen zu k mpfen

4795842 i wasnt sure how bad it was i didnt know what was going to happen was i going to live
4795843 the main reason i have come across is that people are either older and want to protect their own assets or they have been through a separation before and they want to make sure they are protected
4795844 people are more savvy these days perhaps they have less expectation that their relationship is going to last forever
4795845 the finance part is the binding part but many people think they might as well work out lifestyle clauses
4795846 it wouldnt surprise me if fidelity or weight was a clause it depends on the personalities involved and the relative positions of those involved

4795874 vereinzelt waren wenige minuten vor der pause und dann mehrfach ab der 70 spielminute im stadion juden jena sprechch re zu h ren gewesen gegen ende der partie waren es 400 bis 500 leute die vom u eren bereich der haupttrib ne aus die rufe von sich gaben
4795875 als dann im verlauf der zweiten spielh lfte die sprechch re erneut aufkamen und dies in stark erh hter intensit t erfolgte zeitgleich zur kommunikation zwischen den sicherheitsbeauftragten beider vereine eine ansage des erfurter stadionsprechers derartige rufe zu unterlassen
4795876 es ist leider nicht vermeidbar dass es in jedem stadion immer ein paar bekloppte gibt aber die intensit t von 400 bis 500 personen hat mich best rzt
4795877 beide vereine sind ganz klar daran interessiert dass aufkl rung betrieben wird
4795878 klar spielt bei solchen vorf llen sicher auch die besondere derbyatmosph re eine rolle
4795879 trotzdem d rfen wir sowas nat rlich nicht zulassen solche ges nge gehen gar nicht
4795880 egal ob das wenige sind oder viele solch ein verhalten werden wir nicht akzeptieren
4795881 last i heard they were starting to write it and they were thinking about setting it in the eighties
4795882 but i know when we were shooting it director adam mckay said if they ever did something it would have to be really weird like we were on the moon or something i think it has to go even further if it was to work
4795883 i dont know if its a throwaway comment adam mckay had made at some io9

4795891 we have estimated the damage to be between 1 200 and 1 500 acres
4795892 i feel that we have businesses up on the highway that would definitely see a benefit from that from the increased traffic and hopefully we can pull some of that traffic into our downtown businesses to support our businesses down on the square
4795893 canadians are pretty good about having their documents when they travel

4795900 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4795901 we should lend authority and credibility and provide a stage more often to the young people of our city and world because their voice can be just as holy strong and maybe even more necessary

4795912 because in it the social character of mens labour appears to them as an objective character stamped upon the products of that labour because the relation of the producers to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as a social relation existing not between themselves but between the products of their labour
4795913 connecting the labour of one individual with that of another appear not as direct social relations between individuals at work but as what they really are material relations between persons and social relations between things

4795918 pakistan will not negotiate with terrorists but it will not refrain from talking to insurgent tribesmen whose withdrawal of support could help drain the swamp in which terrorists fester and grow yet no talks will be held with anyone refusing to lay down arms

4795937 the taliban does not practice the anti u s style of fundamentalism practiced by iran
4795938 we should be willing to offer recognition and humanitarian assistance and to promote international economic reconstruction
4795939 the hidden stakes in the war against terrorism can be summed up in a single word oil the map of terrorist sanctuaries and targets in the middle east and central asia is also to an extraordinary degree a map of the worlds principal energy sources in the 21st century it is inevitable that the war against terrorism will be seen by many as a war on behalf of americas chevron exxon and arco frances totalfinaelf british petroleum royal dutch shell and other multinational giants which have hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in the region
4795940 the state department is exploring the potential for post taliban energy projects in the region which has more than 6 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves and almost 40 percent of its gas reserves

4795960 to me it just validates my belief that god botherers are weak weak individuals so weak in fact that they require a bearded old dude holding a lightening bolt over their head to make them do the right thing
4795961 if someone believes they have been molested by little green men does that make it true
4795962 a bearded old dude holding a lightening bolt over our heads
4795963 don t atheists berate christians or muslims or jews for their arrogance in believing that theirs is the only true faith
4795964 well simply because you believe there is no god does that make it true

4795969 you see it has been our misfortune to have the wrong religion why didnt we have the religion of the japanese who regard sacrifice for the fatherland as the highest good the religion of mohammed too would have been much more compatible with us than christianity why did it have to be christianity with its meekness and flabbiness
4795970 the dis array of modern moral theories have arisen in a milieu of the denial of theistic roots
4795971 show me a marxist state that hasn t persecuted christians and banned the freedom of religion
4795972 when you condemn all religions and say they are a fairytale that is wrong said rich stormes a nearby business owner
4795973 show me a marxist state that hasn t persecuted christians and banned the freedom of religion
4795974 anyone who quotes freerepublic com a well known anti american christian fascist web site becomes very suspect
4795975 i would counter with show me a christian theocracy that hasn t persecuted semites and also banned freedom of religion and mandated their own waring religion over the masses
4795976 maybe the fact that religious studies read roman catholic doctrine is still a subject taught in all maltese schools has something to do with it even though personally i see turning something which should be one s own belief into an academic subject which you can sit exams and get grades for as utterly bizarre
4795977 but if we look to the truth in g d who is christ jesus he will set you free from your sins and see the truth that you see in all people that we are sinners and there is not one who is righteous
4795978 moral depravity has been demonstrated in the atheist community through history and through various studies
4795979 those with whom you make an agreement and then they break theirt agreement every time and they do not gaurd against punishment

4795981 i am in no position to challange my lord if i truely believ the quarn is the word of god and that muhammed is his finbal messenger and that he is the almighty then i have to accept everything he commands is for mankind s benefit and everything he forbids is in one way or another not beneficial for us

4795984 all religions believe god is infinite in power with an infinite number of qualities and infinite in time and space and knowledge
4795985 for godels theorem to apply the formal system must be sophisticated enough to formulate its own consistency
4795986 religions have beliefs which is not the same as an axiom
4795987 you mentioned that you find it hard to believe that people think god is infinite in time that is beyond time and infinite in intelligence and is basically indescribable except for the fact that he is indescribable
4795988 we as rational thinkers the world over have to join our voices with those brave souls willing to speak out against religious delusion there can be only one goal if we are to save humanity and that is to beat religion back into the holes it has crawled out of and make it a shameful thing to proclaim belief in any fool thing you have no evidence for
4795989 all religions believe god is infinite in power with an infinite number of qualities and infinite in time and space and knowledge
4795990 i find that to be hard to swallow for one thing infinite in power would remove the concept of free will which is inherent in most religions
4795991 subjectively we must acknowledge our experiences for them to be of any use

4796002 true enough but their pillowy soft preconference schedule was what made the jayhawks school record 12 1 mark suspect in the eyes of many it wasnt the teams they played in the league that happened to be through no fault of the jayhawks going through down years but none of that is a problem now once again in fact mangino may wind up using the schedule to psyche up his troops the road is about to get much much tougher despite the loss of several key players the jayhawks could be better than last year and not have nearly as fine a record
4796003 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months

4796018 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4796019 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4796020 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4796021 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4796022 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4796023 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4796024 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4796025 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4796026 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4796027 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4796028 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4796029 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4796030 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4796031 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4796032 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4796033 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4796041 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4796042 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4796043 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4796044 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4796045 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4796046 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4796047 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4796048 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4796049 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4796050 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4796051 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4796052 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4796053 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4796054 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4796055 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4796056 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4796057 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4796058 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4796059 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4796060 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4796061 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4796062 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4796063 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4796064 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4796065 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4796066 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4796067 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4796068 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4796069 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4796070 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4796071 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4796072 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4796073 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4796074 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4796075 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4796076 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4796077 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4796078 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4796079 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4796080 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4796197 are wide of the mark for everyone agrees that we must follow the quran and the sunna of the prophet allah bless him and give him peace
4796198 these continued efforts both by iraq army and mnd b soldiers provide the local residents iraq security forces and coalition forces an opportunity to pursue peace
4796199 this is invaluable for these people this country right now
4796200 these series of operations are directed toward thwarting terrorist and criminal activities as the government of iraq demonstrates a determination to bring those operating outside the law to justice
4796201 this attack was far off of the main pilgrimage routes due to the security efforts of the 42nd brigade 11th division of the iraqi army and the local police
4796202 the iraqi army continues to develop capability and will not be set back by these types of senseless attacks on innocent civilians
4796203 detention of this individual has limited special group members access to the munitions from a weapons cache that was controlled by him and prevents future attacks that potentially result in the deaths of civilians
4796204 we want to train and work with the u s army
4796205 we like our job here of running the traffic control point and providing security at the entrance of the patrol base
4796206 right now the iraqi soldiers have taken over the responsibility of the traffic control point but we are going to train them to be able to take over the entire patrol base go and do presence patrols and set up temporary traffic control points in our area
4796207 we are integrating with the isf to make us a better fighting force
4796208 they have stepped up to the plate and their partnership is why we are able to take over the mission that the georgians had to leave behind with no change in the security and safety of the iraqi people
4796209 i want to fight fiercely alongside the u s army
4796210 i get more training to be able to do the job
4796211 your father sir he went to meet with the constable
4796212 your father gave me instructions to make sure you didnt leave sir and
4796213 i went past him and turned on the garden walk
4796214 then it dawned on me that durant hadnt gone with my father either
4796215 help me dump these antoine and well have a talk
4796216 your fathers gone to talk to the constable talk to the mayor
4796217 aye going to explain what happened last night and other things
4796218 father says his sons are bastards that hes a criminal along with his whole family
4796219 now dont get all spirited about it antoine i wasnt thinking a thing like that
4796220 because a man wants to know if his intentions are fair
4796221 if a mans going to die for something young master then it should be for the right reasons
4796222 looks like ill have to face his sons instead and
4796223 he should be all of them should be punished for humiliating clarissa
4796224 also for hurting my mother i couldnt believe still cant believe they just walked in and did that i could shoot all three of them
4796225 today though youll just have to be a better shot
4796226 man named tom wilkes was the constable just before you was born your father and some men were going with the constable to round up one of alberts cousins wanted in illinois country for horse thieving this was before the morris family bought that house on charing street lived on the algernon land that old plantation wilkes and your father and the rest of the company all of them ambushed on the way down that track to the plantation two men killed including tom wilkes nobody went looking for the morris clan after that
4796227 not after what happened to old tom then the thewliss family took up their guns the father first now his son the present constable aye your father knows well enough what that wicked bunch may do and hes gone to make sure the morris boys dont set an ambush
4796228 no young master not like that quite the opposite i think
4796229 shes different than them others seen her going to church all the time with her aunt
4796230 why dont the rest of the family go to st elizabeths for mass
4796231 because they arent catholics antoine like most of this town
4796232 theyre good old fashioned english protestants straight from the old country why the morris familys been fightin catholics all the ways back to oliver cromwell family still has lands in ireland given them by that old roundhead warrior himself
4796233 the aunt muriel downright defied her brother albert and word has it she threatened to expose the whole clans dirty activities if not allowed to convert not a big thing in the end you see for albert and that bunch dont take to religious matters too much
4796234 defied her father just like her aunt became baptized in the faith goes to church every chance she gets
4796235 old albert was going to send her up to a private school in st louis away from these heathen idolators as he called the catholics but the poor girl ran away since she was his only daughter and he does have a soft spot for the ladies the old man promised to let her convert to the faith and go to st elizabeths just to make her stay this was when you were just a lad about nine or ten years old
4796236 you see antoine girl has spirit i give her that but shes also a pure blood of his
4796237 them boys like you said are bastards she is the only legitimate heir to all his lead mines and shipping fortune
4796238 just like the matter of love not so simple just to want something antoine
4796239 he gazed at me from a wiser time all those years he had passed and experienced
4796240 the honor of a woman is an even better one the particulars dont matter except to yourself
4796241 just that i was wondering if you knew anything about victor lagrange
4796242 i was i was just wondering if youd seen him lately
4796243 as far as i understand antoine he doesnt know what happened out there neither do many others in this town
4796244 the constable took me with him to go look at it
4796245 guess he thinks i know how to fight his father and i go back a ways
4796246 i didnt find lagrange out there i didnt find a body just that whole place all torn up
4796247 no looked up and down those parts not a hair of him
4796248 never by yourself not even with another person just leave it alone
4796249 take it anyway tuck it in the back of your pants hide it under your coat
4796250 dear lord you done took so many of my people im just wondering why you havent taken my life like what the hell am i doing right
4796251 get out of my head no its moist and spacious
4796252 berperang dalam bulan itu adalah dosa besar tetapi menghalangi manusia dari jalan allah kafir kepada allah menghalangi masuk masjidilharam dan mengusir penduduknya dari sekitarnya lebih besar dosanya di sisi allah

4796254 islam khususnya iran akan tetap diberi label buruk yang negatif dan dianggap sumber pengganas oleh as walaupun bercanggah dengan konsep dan peraturan pertubuhan bangsa bangsa bersatu
4796255 pengganas dan dasar keganasan bukan jadi amalan dasar mahupun budaya iran sebaliknya kami berpegang dengan prinsip islam yang menjamin keamanan seluruh isi alam
4796256 apa yang diusahakan oleh iran adalah untuk pembangunan ekonomi keselamatan dan menjaga kepentingan rakyat negaranya serta umat islam keseluruhannya
4796257 tindakan as ke atas afghanistan kerana pasukan taliban serta pencerobohan ke atas iraq kerana al qaeeda adalah alasan semata mata
4796258 faktor utama tindakan kuasa besar as itu adalah kerana agama dan mahu menguasai ekonomi serta keselamatan di asia barat
4796259 walaupun kuasa bush berakhir november depan dan sama ada barack obama atau john mccain yang menerajui as selepas ini dasar luar white house tidak banyak akan berubah
4796260 iran sangat perlukan sokongan secara kolektif dari seluruh rantau teluk dan negara negara islam dalam usaha mempertahankan keselamatan dan kesucian agama islam
4796261 cuma kemungkinan untuk lebih fleksibel dalam perlaksanaan dasar luarnya boleh berlaku sekiranya obama memenangi kerusi presiden
4796262 be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them if you do you will have no reward from your father in heaven
4796263 when you fast do not look somber as the hypocrites do for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
4796264 the eye is the lamp of the body if your eyes are good your whole body will be full of light
4796265 no one can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other
4796266 and why do you worry about clothes see how the lilies of the field grow they do not labor or spin
4796267 establishmentarian religion serves to bless convene and otherwise hold a sacred umbrella over the community at large when consensus has to be built it is there to build it when a common goal has to be achieved it is there to hallow it nationally in the first part of the 20th century the presiding bishop of the episcopalians or the bishop of the methodists or the stated clerk of the presbyterians were there to do the job after world war ii a more interfaith approach came to the fore perhaps the greatest contribution of establishmentarianism in american history was to set its seal on the civil rights movement but the lesson mainstream religion took away from that era was not of its own role but of the prophetic one incarnated in martin luther king jr and ever since it is the image of the prophet not the priest that has mesmerized the imaginations of american religious leaders that goes of course for those evangelical leaders who modeling themselves on the black civil rights clergy they had once reviled created the religious right a generation ago

4796279 the world needs to help georgia maintain its sovereignty its territorial integrity and its independence

4796297 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4796298 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4796299 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4796300 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4796301 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4796302 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4796303 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4796304 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4796305 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s

4796307 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4796308 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4796309 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4796310 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4796311 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4796312 but i also accepted it because for me doesnt matter
4796313 i just want to enjoy this moment because its a huge moment in my career
4796314 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site

4796323 i remember our first fight your skeletons were all up over you i can still taste that night when you told me youd been beat up and abused
4796324 but theres something ive gotta know before we say goodbye will i see you again somewhere in another life

4796360 i want to have a dialogue with the russians i want them to get out of georgian territory as quickly as possible and i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
4796361 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4796362 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4796363 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4796364 russia rolls over georgia hillary clinton does the same to barack obama now we know whos boss obama blinked and stands guilty of appeasing clinton by agreeing to a roll call vote for her nomination it was supposed to be his party now its theirs his and hers
4796365 what if you have an 18 year old daughter who has a breakdown in one of these dark zones
4796366 nearly four out of every 10 streetlights along i 794 and the lake parkway are burned out leaving motorists to drive without the guidance of that familiar orange glow spilling down from above as they cruise the expressway late at night
4796367 you tell your kids not to jump into a strangers car alone and why thats dangerous tell them why they shouldnt travel the internet highway alone and why it is dangerous
4796368 of course the democratic party is breathing a giant sigh of relief what if edwards had won the nomination theyd be looking at the prospect of their nominee engulfed in a sexual scandal that makes bill clinton look like a prude since edwards didnt win the only harm to the democrats is that yet another one of their heroes has been exposed as a lying lout he joins a large club
4796369 i am vetoing this proposal because it is unfair to raise the vehicle registration fee from 75 to 95 for only city of milwaukee residents at a time when residents are already grappling with increases in food and fuel prices a 26 increase in the vehicle registration fee and a complete elimination of the responsibility of other property owners is not the road to go down
4796370 if milwaukee dramatically increases the number of kids who take the act well no longer be in the number one or two in the country were going to drop if the state of wisconsin wants to be one or two in the act theyre going to have to figure out ways to help milwaukee kids do better
4796371 here we are in 2008 and its early august and were already seeing problems im very concerned that were going to see more problems throughout 2008
4796372 this is the very reason i have fought for photo id in order to receive a ballot we have added more names on the voter rolls and we still have no idea if the person that is handed the ballot is truly that person
4796373 unfortunately the gop will use any excuse to call for the use of voter id if it rains too hard theyll say its because people arent required to show their drivers licenses when they vote

4796383 some people view my accent as a weakness i view my weaknesses as strengths when i wanted to become a body builder i had the wrong type of body i had to work twice as hard as the other body builders who naturally had the good body type in hollywood there are thousands of football players bouncers stunt men body guards and former military veterans each of them wants to be the big action star my accent will make me stand out from the crowd it will differentiate me from the others nobody else sounds like i do it makes me unique someday people will even imitate my accent

4796387 kita memang tinggal di negara dengan mayoritas muslim tetapi masalah makanan tetap harus berhati hati
4796388 pada zaman jahiliyah dulu aku pernah mendukuni seseorang dan tiadalah aku melakukan perdukunan itu melainkan hanya tipu daya
4796389 lalu orang itu datang kepadaku dan memberikan barang barang itu kepadaku barang itulah yang tuan makan tadi
4796390 barang siapa makan makanan halal berperilaku sesuai sunnah dan manusia lain selamat dari gangguannya niscaya ia akan masuk surga
4796391 ya rasul apakah orang semacam itu di tengah umatmu banyak jumlahnya
4796392 akan ada orang orang seperti itu dalam kurun kurun waktu sesudahku

4796395 was recording studios without any room reverb or ambience the playing room at windmill lane studios was designed to be totally dead and you can hear it on the drums it wasnt until the boy sessions that we figured out that we had to pull the drum kit into the entrance hall after the receptionist had gone home to get a decent drum sound with its three story stairwell and stone and tiled surfaces it was a great live room
4796396 rebecca starts with r rrrrr batman starts with b buh joker starts with j juh
4796397 it was hard to decide what to wear i doubted there were any etiquette books detailing how to dress when your vampire sweetheart takes you home to meet his vampire family
4796398 you can use the cars one and when they get more ariels we will get you one
4796399 i grew up in the projects of st louis so as you can imagine i didnt make it to broadway by myself
4796400 i asked the kids why they wanted to learn english and one of them said that it is the language of the educated man
4796401 these kids were on their vacation and this is what they were doing taking in everything we gave them it reminds me of the yearning and excitement for education that african americans had coming out of slavery
4796402 i grew up in the projects of st louis so as you can imagine i didnt make it to broadway by myself
4796403 its my responsibility as a father and son as a brother and partner to give a hand wherever i can
4796404 this play resonates in a lot of directions and i think about it in my own relationship to my father and my son
4796405 how do we forgive people who love us and who we love even though they hurt us bad
4796406 jay dub and i go back a ways and i tell you he has developed into something special
4796407 in the last 10 years or so he has found the power that he has in that really unique instrument that he has he has come into an understanding of who he is with his craft seeping deep in and all his life experiences bubbling up through his characters its been wonderful to watch
4796408 shakespearean actors can be presentational the artifice in fact often serves the work
4796409 but that doesnt fly in wilson it has to seem completely unaffected so you dont wear craft on your sleeve jay dub does that
4796410 you have to understand that when i was growing up i had a counselor tell me that she didnt believe i would make 21
4796411 a lot of people prayed for me went the extra yard so when i go onstage its a tribute to those people and if the opportunity comes for me to get my butt on a plane and help a street child in nairobi or wherever ive got to do it my life is not my own
4796412 bersuci dari hadats besar merupakan salah satu amanah diantara amanah amanah antara hamba dengan rabbnya wajib baginya untuk menjaganya memperhatikan hukumnya agar ia mampu melaksanakannya berdasarkan cara yang disyariatkan sesuatu yang bermasalah baginya diantara hukumnya dan konsekuensinya maka dia ditanyakan janganlah perasaan malu menghalangi dirinya dari hal itu karena allah tidak malu dari kebenaran jadi malu yang menghalangi bagi pemiliknya dari bertanya tentang urusan agamanya merupakan malu yang tercela itu sebenarnya sifat pengecut dari setan agar dia bisa merintangi manusia untuk menyempurnakan agamanya dan mengenal hukum hukum yang wajib baginya perkara bersuci merupakan perkara yang amat agung dan dia amat penting karena terakibatkan sahnya sholat yang merupakan tiang agama
4796413 wahai rasulullah sesungguhnya allah tak malu karena kebenaran apakah wajib bagi seorang wanita untuk mandi junub bila ia mimpi basah
4796414 jika engkau menyemburkan memancarkan air mani maka mandi junublah jika tidak menyemburkannya maka jangan mandi
4796415 dalam hadits ini terdapat peringatan bahwa sesuatu yang keluar tanpa syahwat entah karena sakit atau dingin maka hal itu tidak mengharuskan mandi
4796416 jika ia suami telah duduk diantara empat anggota tubuhnya yaitu kedua tangan dan kedua kaki pen lalu ia menggaulinya maka wajib baginya mandi sekalipun ia tidak mengeluarkan mani
4796417 dari qois bin ashim bahwa ia telah masuk islam lalu ia diperintahkan oleh nabi shollallahu alaihi wasallam untuk mandi dengan air dan daun bidara
4796418 jika masa haidh datang maka tinggalkan sholat jika telah pergi usai maka cucilah darah yang ada pada dirimu dan sholatlah
4796419 mandi junub memiliki bentuk bentuk yang mencukupi dan bentuk sempurna yang disebutkan al khiroqi disini adalah bentuk yang sempurna sebagian shahabat kami berkata bentuk yang sempurna datang disebutkan di dalamnya sepuluh perkara niat membaca bismillah mencuci kedua tangan dua kali mencuci sesuatu yang terkena gangguan mani berwudhu menciduk air dengan telapak keatas kepala sebanyak dua kali sehinnga bisa membasahi pangkal rambut mengalirkan air keseluruh badan memulai dengan bagian kanan badan menggosok badan dengan tangan berpindah dari tempat mandinya lalu mencuci kaki dan dianjurkan untuk menyela nyelai pangkal rambut kepala dan jenggotnya dengan air sebelum mengalirkan air ke badan
4796420 dulu rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam apabila mandi junub maka beliau mulai dengan mencuci kedua tangannya lalu beliau tuang air ketangan kirinya dengan tangan kanannya seraya mencuci kemaluannya kemudian dia berwudhu seperti ketika ia mau sholat lalu mengambil air seraya memasukkan tangannya ke pangkal rambutnya setelah itu dia menciduk air ke atas kepalanya sebanyak tiga kali cidukan lalu dia mengalirkan air keseluruh tubuhnya berikutnya ia mencuci kedua kakinya
4796421 dari maimunah ia berkata bahwa nabi shollallahu alaihi wasallam pernah mandi junub lalu ia mencuci kemaluannya dengan tangannya kemudian ia menggosokkan tangannya ke dinding lalu mencucinya dan berwudhu sepertinya ketika mau sholat tatkala usai mandi maka beliau mencuci kedua kakinya

4796437 hanya satu negeri yang menjadi negeriku ia tumbuh dari perbuatan dan perbuatan itu adalah usahaku
4796438 bagi diri saya tidak timbul perasaan rendah diri kerana isteri saya memahami yang saya bekerja sendiri dan bukannya makan gaji
4796439 sebagai seorang kontraktor saya menghargai pengorbanan isteri yang adakalanya membelanjakan wangnya dahulu untuk perbelanjaan keluarga kami jika gaji saya lambat masuk kerana wang lewat dijelaskan oleh pelanggan
4796440 elok juga jika gaji isteri lebih besar daripada suami sekurang kurangnya ekonomi rumah tangga tidaklah terjejas
4796441 yang penting pemberian isteri itu harus ikhlas dan tidak mengungkit segala bantuannya kepada suami
4796442 sepatutnya kita harus bersyukur dengan keikhlasannya meringankan bebanan kita dan apa yang diperlukan sekarang ialah hormat menghormati antara satu sama lain
4796443 jika saya berada di tempat isteri saya sudah tentu saya tidak akan melayan suami yang mengambil kesempatan sedemikian
4796444 tambahan pula apabila isteri membeli rumah atau perkakas perkakas rumah seperti sofa meja makan dan set televisyen jika berlaku perselisihan faham isteri akan mengungkit pembeliannya
4796445 jangan fikir mereka boleh tunjuk kuasa dan ego terhadap suami semata mata mereka bergaji besar

4796452 christ reign in us no matter what no matter what
4796453 what has happened to me prison has really served to advance the gospel
4796454 and i will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith
4796455 for me to live is christ and to die is gain
4796456 paul asserts that living has no meaning apart from christ he is the object motive inspiration and goal of all that the apostle does
4796457 christ reign in us no matter what no matter what comes
4796458 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus
4796459 i have no one else like him who takes a genuine interest in your welfare for everyone looks out for his own interests not those of jesus christ
4796460 honor men like him because he almost died for the work of christ risking his life
4796461 so warm in pursuing their own interests but they were cold in the work of the lord
4796462 may the mind of christ my savior live in me from day to day by his power and love controlling all i do and say
4796463 may the love of jesus fill me as the waters fill the sea christ exalting self abasing this is victory
4796464 may his beauty rest upon me as i seek the lost to win and may they forget the channel seeing only him
4796465 watch out for those dogs those men who do evil those mutilators of the flesh
4796466 if you have any encouragement from being united with christ if any comfort from his love if any fellowship with the spirit if any tenderness and compassion
4796467 look not only to your own interests but to the interests of others
4796468 this is what im thinking but id love to know what you think help me understand your point of view
4796469 estou feliz porque joguei bem e a equipe superou os erros que teve contra a r ssia foi um jogo duro e a chave para nossa vit ria foi a efici ncia do nosso ataque
4796470 sacaram todas as bolas em mim e eu tive que virar 43 bolas
4796471 eu poderia ter jogador melhor mas tive dificuldades em atacar eles sacaram forte e bloquearam bem mas consegui me superar agora podem continuar fazendo isso que estarei mais preparado e com confian a total
4796472 nunca tive um jogo t o emocionante estou muito feliz e nem quero pensar no pr ximo advers rio agora s quero ligar para minha fam lia e para os meus amigos com certeza eles sofreram muito
4796473 controlamos nossos nervos no primeiro set apesar do placar o jogo foi duro no segundo e terceiro sets o brasil botou press o neles nosso ataque funcionou muito bem al m do passe e da defesa tivemos volume de jogo
4796474 um novo circuito sempre abre um campo e d oportunidades para um piloto ter algum impacto ent o nosso feedback ser muito importante para achar o acerto correto
4796475 estamos bem preparados e estou esperan oso em nosso potencial de marcar pontos no fim de semana
4796476 and tho this world with devils filled should threaten to undo us we will not fear for god hath willed his truth to triumph through us the prince of darkness grim we tremble not for him his rage we can endure for lo his doom is sure one little word shall fell him that word above all earthly powers no thanks to them abideth the spirit and the gifts are ours through him who with us sideth let goods and kindred go this mortal life also the body they may kill gods truth abideth still his kingdom is forever
4796477 not that i have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect but i press on to take hold of that for which christ took hold of me
4796478 blameless and pure children of god without fault in a crooked and depraved generation
4796479 by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another
4796480 foi grande o esfor o durante toda a partida que faltou gua no final
4796481 gostoso vencer por toda a hist ria que tinha as coincid ncias que juntaram estava 0 a 0 um expulso passou o filme daquele jogo mas no intervalo da prorroga o tive a certeza de que vencer amos
4796482 continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling
4796483 this passage is an exhortation to common action urging the philippians to show forth the graces of christ in their lives to make their eternal salvation fruitful in the here and now as they fulfill their responsibilities to one another as well as to non christians
4796484 give me one pure and holy passion give me one magnificent obsession give me one glorious ambition for my life to know and follow hard after you
4796485 your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus
4796486 humbled himself by becoming obedient to death death on a cross
4796487 humble yourselves therefore under gods mighty hand that he may lift you up in due time
4796488 he made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of god in him
4796489 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4796490 its a pity that when we are still faced with a most complicated situation to work on the united states is further aggravating the situation in relations with russia
4796491 russia is strong and russia has to be reckoned with
4796492 returned to sender because the addressee could not be found at this address
4796493 its good to be back in the premier league we are disappointed with the result but we showed great character and showed what a good team we can be at times
4796494 in the second half we went out and gave arsenal a good game in the first 25 minutes we showed them a little bit too much respect
4796495 when you are a goal down against arsenal you are chasing the game but we gave a brave performance we can hold our heads up high now and look forward to the rest of the season
4796496 i thought it was going in but the keeper made a great save and then there was a great block on the line by eboue
4796497 i was just about to celebrate and then it was turned out for a corner but these things happen
4796498 he was a quality defender in the right place at the right time it wasnt just about giving a good account of ourselves because we know as a group of players what we want to achieve this year
4796499 we want to carry on from last year with the style of football that we play and today we did that
4796500 whomsoever god desires to guide he expands his breast to islam
4796501 today i have perfected your religion d n for you i have completed my blessing upon you i have approved islam for your religion
4796502 have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon
4796503 i was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of israel
4796504 it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs
4796505 yes lord yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
4796506 woman great is your faith let it be done for you as you wish
4796507 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4796508 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4796509 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
4796510 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
4796511 the homes are still evacuated and they will be until the water recedes completely but the water has gone down substantially
4796512 the homes are probably about 300 metres away from the trans canada highway and we were scared the highway might move with all the water behind it
4796513 if the culverts happen to let go all of a sudden it could be like a tsunami and flood the whole area
4796514 their know how their experience their ability in co ordinating in kosovo i expect will make a real difference
4796515 there are different levels of personnel contribution from different countries this specific request was made and we responded
4796516 im moment gehen wir noch davon aus dass das jahr 2009 etwas besser wird als 2008
4796517 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the republican party
4796518 because we just give more opportunity to folks who are hard working people who are immigrants and come from members of minority groups
4796519 howard deans comments on race and gender today are disappointing and wrong
4796520 his efforts to divide americans are an insult to all our nations citizens and have absolutely no place in the national dialogue
4796521 thanks i did but i need a rest now all that dancing on top of all the running earlier has worn me out
4796522 do you want to go then or we could get some rooms and stay here tonight
4796523 i dont see why not when youve finished your drink well go and see whats what
4796524 my legs are its probably my own fault for running and dancing so much in these shoes
4796525 come on then lets go to your room and i can give you that foot massage i promised
4796526 jenny luke smith first time for both of them and possibly theres a risk of someone walking in on them also luke is at least 18 insofar as hes 14 now
4796527 yes the doctor loves her and he makes mum happy
4796528 is that why she is making those sounds because she is happy
4796529 bits and pieces i suppose but thats just from things i pick up i know daddy has sex with people donna martha river but ive never really heard so much before i wouldnt even know for sure that he was having sex with all those women but i snuck by his room once when he was with martha and heard them plus ive overheard things hes said to them all and they sound like things men say on television when they are being seductive
4796530 i know im probably not as exciting as those girls on the television but i want to know what it feels like i want to make noises like them
4796531 neither of us have but theres a first time for everything and i think it should be now so how do we start
4796532 does that mean that were done that we cant have sex now ive heard that things end after the man orgasms
4796533 i can still have sex it might take a few minutes but ive certainly got more than one orgasm in me
4796534 do you know how to give a girl an orgasm too luke
4796535 well i want to have one i want to make those pretty sounds
4796536 look at me luke i like when you look at me
4796537 stay right there you can hold onto my shoulders if you need
4796538 i think i want you inside me now luke will you put your cock inside me
4796539 i heard that being on top hurts less for your first time
4796540 uh yes i think it hurts a bit is that normal
4796541 yes from what i understand it should pass otherwise we can stop
4796542 luke im going to need you to get up early tom
4796543 doctor somehow i dont think this is london circa 6002
4796544 well i guess that narrows down when we are considerably
4796545 you never forget your first time as much as you might like to
4796546 hey look at you and whos that with you there
4796547 you mean to say you two right there in the play park in public
4796548 well we cant leave now youll hear us itll ruin your time
4796549 oh believe me it could not possibly get worse than it actually was
4796550 no it wasnt come on it never is the first time
4796551 i dunno it just isnt no one knows what theyre doing
4796552 dont you lot have books you can read about it some instructions that seems like it would be the sensible thing
4796553 but that chap you were with he looks quite a bit older than you not that theres anything wrong with that mind
4796554 so naive doctor just because a blokes done it a million times before doesnt mean he knows what hes doing and if its your first time its not like you know to tell him different
4796555 so what did he do that was so objectionable youre both looking rather clumsy i must say
4796556 i used to call him worm lips to my girlfriends
4796557 you like it better when someone kisses you like this
4796558 youre right rose and whats more he does look a bit handsy
4796559 look at him pawing at you you cant have liked that can you
4796560 how can he enjoy how smooth your skin is just kind of flapping around like that
4796561 i i think one time he ripped my shirt trying to get it off me yeah
4796562 thats right he ripped one of my favorite tops the prick
4796563 taking the time to undress you its part of the anticipation he doesnt know what hes missing

4796569 that jimmy stone was the kind of man who would leave a lady at a disadvantage nudity wise thats so unfair
4796570 being without ones clothes youre so vulnerable its just bad form to not share in the experience
4796571 he probably never even wanted you to touch yourself so he could watch while he undressed am i right
4796572 so what else do you think you can do better
4796573 i reckon wee jimmy stone never thought to bring you off long before himself
4796574 if jimmy stone had ever done that i bet hed never let you get warmed back up again before taking his own pleasure
4796575 jimmy stone never did any of those things and as a result i never did this to him

4796602 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
4796603 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
4796604 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
4796605 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
4796606 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position

4796638 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4796639 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4796640 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture

4796653 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website

4796716 im not special it was just a little jump it was cool with me
4796717 i dont want to compare myself to either one of those great quarterbacks i want to play my game and see what i can do i have to keep my head up
4796718 he still has a long way to go he cant get complacent
4796719 i didnt do it right i wasnt close to where i should have been rausch needs to enjoy it but he still has to work
4796720 head coach greg mcmackin said alexander and funaki are the co no 2 quarterbacks alexander did not practice yesterday morning because of an in grown toenail on his right foot and a tender left ankle mcmackin said alexanders ailments are not considered to be serious
4796721 to keep improving because our no 2 guys are going to keep forcing him its like any other position as youre competing if you fall off theres somebody else there to take your place our other quarterbacks are going to push him into greatness
4796722 hes not really a double clutcher he comes over the top with it he controls the nose of the football he knows where the ball is going its on that plane
4796723 hes a competitor hes got some fire hes responded when we put him in difficult situations
4796724 what does it sound like its all palm trees its not like that its straight desert its hot sometimes it gets to 120 but i was cool with that i had dirt bikes i had an off road truck i could live with it it was good
4796725 this is awesome this is winter back in palm springs
4796726 rausch was told of his selection during a closed door meeting thursday with mcmackin alexander and funaki
4796727 my family found out before i did my pops was crying my mom was crying
4796728 rausch justified the coaches decision with another dazzling performance yesterday morning he was particularly sharp on red zone drills when the defense went to the okie scheme three linebackers five defensive backs to create a 5 on 8 matchup rausch still managed to find the open receiver
4796729 weve evaluated him a lot and it was a tough decision but he knows we believe in him were going with him the more positive reps he can get with the guys against the no 1 defense that helps him
4796730 it was a lot different today it was a lot of stress off my shoulders
4796731 im just real happy with the way the guys are working not just the qbs brents really stepping it up and has a great feel for what were doing
4796732 there was a running back on my team in jc who said youre going there watch i was like dude youre crazy i wish id go there he gave me a call about a month ago and said i told you he totally called it
4796733 weve evaluated them very closely and hes just been getting better and better we started noticing that when other guys would go up then have a bad day he never went backwards to me a quarterback is just like any other position we have guys competing at receiver we have guys competing at all positions the thing is here we throw the ball so much that the quarterback position is a focus point it is on most teams but here its really a focus point
4796734 i give it to coach mack and coach ron lee that was probably a tough decision the past couple of days rausch has really been turning it up it seems like hes really been catching up with the reads and the plays i think we can start moving and make greater improvements now that weve got everything set
4796735 i can read the playbook but inoke told me the reads going to be there or the reads going to here he taught me this offense
4796736 i had a little more confidence more relaxed i was making good throws a lot better than i did yesterday
4796737 i remember the first thing i told him once you get the confidence everybodys going to follow you youre the guy with the rock hes in control of the game so once he gets confidence in himself its going to spread to everybody else
4796738 as for playing at ben hill griffin stadium capacity 88 548 rausch said the biggest crowd hes played in front of was
4796739 the thing i like about brent rausch is hes not afraid of anything i dont think hes going to be scared at all i think hes going to go in there be excited playing the heisman trophy guy tim tebow across from him playing in the swamp against a top five team hes that kind of a guy hes got it

4796751 la normativa es injusta y solo conseguir acabar con las zonas de marcha santiaguesas
4796752 la gente no deja de salir tarde de las casas y tenemos menos tiempo
4796753 nosotros nos dedicamos al tema de los ru dos y los locales las denuncias las llevan a cabo la polic a local a trav s de las normas de la comunidad aut noma
4796754 los hosteleros no est n contentos pero no podemos complacer a todo el mundo nosotros velamos por la vida en la ciudad y si la gente necesita dormir necesita dormir aunque tambi n divertirse por eso necesitamos un equilibrio entre la diversi n y el descanso
4796755 el otro d a la pol cia entr en nuestro local a las 5 menos diez y ya me dijeron que me pod an multar porque estaban tres personas dentro pero eso depende de los ayuntamientos porque por ejemplo en ordes o santa comba no pasa

4796757 ni siquiera tendr an que cerrar si no hubiese las molestias que hay
4796758 de nada sirven las leyes que se hagan si no se hacen cumplir
4796759 lo que no se puede hacer es pasar de divertirse a romper todo y molestar a todo el mundo
4796760 excesiva en algunos art culos pero permisiva en otros es una normativa gen rica y hay que valorar art culo por art culo
4796761 el problema de los ruidos y de estar abiertos hasta una hora u otra no es ni siquiera importante lo que es importante es que los locales cumplan las normativas de insonorizaci n que la gente no est a ciertas horas en las puertas de los establecimientos porque los dem s ciudadanos tambi n quieren dormir creo que esto es m s importante que la limitaci n de los horarios y estoy seguro de que si dejaran los horarios libres algunos establecimientos incluso cerrar an antes de la hora que est n cerrando ahora
4796762 hace unas semanas entramos a las cinco y media de la ma ana en un pub que sol a cerrar a las ocho pagamos los diez euros de la entrada nos dejaron pasar sin decirnos nada y a los diez minutos cerraron
4796763 es horrible ya casi no tienes a donde ir si esto fuera como otros pa ses europeos que acaban la fiesta a las dos de la ma ana tendr a su l gica pero aqu no
4796764 la normativa esta promovida por las quejas de los vecinos por los ruidos a altas horas lo cual entiendo pero creo q los controles deber an hacerse sobre la insonorizaci n de los locales y dejar los horarios como estaban
4796765 con cerrar a las 6 de la ma ana en vez de a las ocho no solucionan nada yo vivo encima de pubs y s que para los vecinos los ru dos m s molestos son los que se producen antes de esas horas
4796766 la normativa es injusta y solo conseguir acabar con las zonas de marcha santiaguesas
4796767 la gente no deja de salir tarde de las casas y tenemos menos tiempo
4796768 nosotros nos dedicamos al tema de los ru dos y los locales las denuncias las llevan a cabo la polic a local a trav s de las normas de la comunidad aut noma
4796769 los hosteleros no est n contentos pero no podemos complacer a todo el mundo nosotros velamos por la vida en la ciudad y si la gente necesita dormir necesita dormir aunque tambi n divertirse por eso necesitamos un equilibrio entre la diversi n y el descanso
4796770 el otro d a la pol cia entr en nuestro local a las 5 menos diez y ya me dijeron que me pod an multar porque estaban tres personas dentro pero eso depende de los ayuntamientos porque por ejemplo en ordes o santa comba no pasa
4796771 la convivencia de bares vecinos y juventud que debe disfrutar los a os que tiene para divertirse
4796772 ni siquiera tendr an que cerrar si no hubiese las molestias que hay
4796773 de nada sirven las leyes que se hagan si no se hacen cumplir
4796774 lo que no se puede hacer es pasar de divertirse a romper todo y molestar a todo el mundo
4796775 excesiva en algunos art culos pero permisiva en otros es una normativa gen rica y hay que valorar art culo por art culo
4796776 el problema de los ruidos y de estar abiertos hasta una hora u otra no es ni siquiera importante lo que es importante es que los locales cumplan las normativas de insonorizaci n que la gente no est a ciertas horas en las puertas de los establecimientos porque los dem s ciudadanos tambi n quieren dormir creo que esto es m s importante que la limitaci n de los horarios y estoy seguro de que si dejaran los horarios libres algunos establecimientos incluso cerrar an antes de la hora que est n cerrando ahora
4796777 hace unas semanas entramos a las cinco y media de la ma ana en un pub que sol a cerrar a las ocho pagamos los diez euros de la entrada nos dejaron pasar sin decirnos nada y a los diez minutos cerraron
4796778 es horrible ya casi no tienes a donde ir si esto fuera como otros pa ses europeos que acaban la fiesta a las dos de la ma ana tendr a su l gica pero aqu no
4796779 la normativa esta promovida por las quejas de los vecinos por los ruidos a altas horas lo cual entiendo pero creo q los controles deber an hacerse sobre la insonorizaci n de los locales y dejar los horarios como estaban

4796793 er hat sich entschuldigt gefragt wie es uns geht und sich nach sch den bei uns erkundigt
4796794 wir m ssen die situation beenden dass wir in wilmington an jedem tag f nf mill dollar verlust machen

4796802 it is crucial that we undertake this task to review and strengthen what has been implemented to date to ensure access to quality education for all in the years to come

4796804 all children with special needs can be valued contributing members of society if given appropriate educational programmes facilities and support
4796805 the idea is to play our game as similar as brazil in football but i have english football players and the character of each player is different
4796806 but we have some players who play similar to those who play in brazil
4796807 i want to know if my players are as excited about the game and this season as me in training it is okay but in the game it is different
4796808 i expect some mistakes i dont want the mistakes but i know it is impossible after six weeks to go to the field and play 100 percent
4796809 these market leading projects we have in california are something that can be extrapolated around the world

4796814 must be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of georgia
4796815 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4796816 georgia is a member of the united nations and south ossetia and abkhazia lie within its internationally recognized borders
4796817 georgias borders should command the same respect as every other nations
4796818 it is set to be one of the most mind blowing spectacles ever

4796831 it was wrong and we now have to move forward and learn from our mistakes
4796832 i think the board should apoolgise for bringing this festival to the brink of disaster if it hadnt been for the box office of our venue and the other three big venues everyone would have been in trouble
4796833 its not acceptable to say they cannot answer these questions till after the review this is a whitewash
4796834 there are lots of different issues to be considered including the work of the fringe society itself but we have to work together all the various people who make this festival what it is
4796835 i just dont think the board realised what a serious situation this is for all the people who put so much work into this festival they need to look at moving this festival forward and if they cant do that they should let someone else do the job

4796943 i am vetoing this proposal because it is unfair to raise the vehicle registration fee from 75 to 95 for only city of milwaukee residents at a time when residents are already grappling with increases in food and fuel prices a 26 increase in the vehicle registration fee and a complete elimination of the responsibility of other property owners is not the road to go down
4796944 if milwaukee dramatically increases the number of kids who take the act well no longer be in the number one or two in the country were going to drop if the state of wisconsin wants to be one or two in the act theyre going to have to figure out ways to help milwaukee kids do better

4797011 i am vetoing this proposal because it is unfair to raise the vehicle registration fee from 75 to 95 for only city of milwaukee residents at a time when residents are already grappling with increases in food and fuel prices a 26 increase in the vehicle registration fee and a complete elimination of the responsibility of other property owners is not the road to go down
4797012 if milwaukee dramatically increases the number of kids who take the act well no longer be in the number one or two in the country were going to drop if the state of wisconsin wants to be one or two in the act theyre going to have to figure out ways to help milwaukee kids do better
4797013 here we are in 2008 and its early august and were already seeing problems im very concerned that were going to see more problems throughout 2008
4797014 this is the very reason i have fought for photo id in order to receive a ballot we have added more names on the voter rolls and we still have no idea if the person that is handed the ballot is truly that person

4797037 absentee voting can be done by mail there are also some alternatives that weve been working with the states for electronic alternatives for our voters

4797048 we have people from the zeriko coming to talk to the commando leadership to thank the government for going into the valley
4797049 they are extremely happy that the commandos got rid of the tyranny theyve been living with
4797050 the operation was a testament to their hard work and dedication to this country we couldnt have reached this level of effectiveness without the combined joint task task force eagle air assets landing us right on top of the taliban the element of surprise took the wind out of their sails before the fight even started

4797249 en un par de momentos en el reporte se habla de autocensura y despu s se habla del manejo de la publicidad
4797250 s es un elemento que nosotros estamos considerando que puede llevar evidentemente a un control de contenidos en la l nea editorial de medios de comunicaci n hay un n mero muy importante de medios de comunicaci n otra vez por lo general en los estados que viven de la publicidad oficial y la ausencia de una regulaci n clara de este financiamiento hace que los gobiernos utilicen el dinero como premio o retirar el dinero como un castigo por la l nea editorial conocimos de casos claros por ejemplo el de am en guanajuato el cual es evidente y ellos lo tienen muy bien documentado cuando el gobierno de guanajuato decide retirarle la publicidad oficial al diario m s importante del estado simplemente por su l nea editorial evidentemente lo que est pidiendo la misi n es una regulaci n clara transparente como sucedi en el caso en argentina donde la scjn dijo no este dinero es p blico y tiene que tener unos criterios establecidos para poderse repartir al mismo tiempo el asunto de la autocensura es un tema important simo y al mismo tiempo muy sutil porque no hay una definici n clara de autocensura sino lo que se est viviendo en m xico es un miedo a decir lo que se tiene que decir por diversas razones que t las haz mencionado y no quiero repetirlas pero el diagn stico es que este nivel de autocensura es decir por miedo en un contexto determinado ciertos periodistas o editores han decidido retirarse del debate o de informar asuntos de inter s p blico a m me gustar a mencionar que sta es la primera vez en la historia de todas estas organizaciones que nos juntamos en un pa s hacemos un reporte pues de la extensi n que es este reporte y m xico en efecto est en la mira de la comunidad internacional

4797323 vereinzelt waren wenige minuten vor der pause und dann mehrfach ab der 70 spielminute im stadion juden jena sprechch re zu h ren gewesen gegen ende der partie waren es 400 bis 500 leute die vom u eren bereich der haupttrib ne aus die rufe von sich gaben
4797324 als dann im verlauf der zweiten spielh lfte die sprechch re erneut aufkamen und dies in stark erh hter intensit t erfolgte zeitgleich zur kommunikation zwischen den sicherheitsbeauftragten beider vereine eine ansage des erfurter stadionsprechers derartige rufe zu unterlassen
4797325 es ist leider nicht vermeidbar dass es in jedem stadion immer ein paar bekloppte gibt aber die intensit t von 400 bis 500 personen hat mich best rzt
4797326 beide vereine sind ganz klar daran interessiert dass aufkl rung betrieben wird
4797327 klar spielt bei solchen vorf llen sicher auch die besondere derbyatmosph re eine rolle
4797328 trotzdem d rfen wir sowas nat rlich nicht zulassen solche ges nge gehen gar nicht

4797358 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy
4797359 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4797360 i came here just to win and i did just that i didnt even know id broken the world record until i did my victory lap
4797361 now im just concentrating on my two races coming up i came here prepared and im going to try and do it the 100 and 200m double
4797362 when i did take that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race im really lost for words
4797363 now russia needs to honor that agreement and withdraw its forces and of course military operations
4797364 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4797365 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4797366 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states fully recognizes this reality
4797367 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done but i would just note there are already consequences
4797368 there have been universal concern within the eu european union the united states about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4797369 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4797370 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4797371 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4797372 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4797373 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4797374 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4797375 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis

4797377 the tibia is a bit dislocated and the doctor would like to correct this
4797378 hed also like to operate on his knee as theres a big compression there
4797379 for germany we would like to keep the bike free because it will be difficult to find anybody
4797380 but our idea for laguna would be to put one of our american based riders on the bike maybe jamie hacking roger lee hayden or chaz davies
4797381 after i knew how bad johns injuries were i told marco that we have a bike free for the next two events but that he would have to find a solution with ducati to get out of his contract
4797382 toseland stuff is by far the biggest seller hes even outselling valentino rossi
4797383 ive been doing donington for 20 years and this year is going to be better than most because of him
4797384 the biggest seller is the toseland flags weve only got a few thousand of them left and theyre going to sell out pretty quickly
4797385 this is the first time weve come away to watch
4797386 this is my fourth time here because its easy to get to and i love england
4797387 bike racing is not big back home but i know there are a few of us who have come over
4797388 i used to race myself and im here to watch a young norwegian in one of the rookie competitions i used to be his mechanic
4797389 casey looks very strong he has been going incredibly fast but rossi has won here before from bad qualifying positions if it rains on race day anything can happen
4797390 ive liked motocross bikes since i was young but in the last few years ive really got into roadbikes and superbikes its great to come here
4797391 its in my contract that im not allowed to ride bikes but id love to if i fell off that could be the end of my footballing career so its not worth it
4797392 when newcastle striker alan smith and i get together with england we talk about bikes a lot im surprised hes not here today
4797393 were supposed to be camping out but it depends on the weather i dont know if we can get the tent up
4797394 when i play football everyone looks at me but now its my turn to look at the likes of toseland and rossi
4797395 well why dont you tell him to give us something we can use to make our case
4797396 new announcements regarding new displaylink products are coming in at a fairly alarming rate and i must say this is one of the few technologies out now that deserves all the attention its getting

4797400 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4797401 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4797402 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4797403 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4797424 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4797425 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4797426 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4797427 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4797428 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4797429 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4797430 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4797431 as an evangelical i am much more interested in his list of questions than in either of their answers

4797439 of course the democratic party is breathing a giant sigh of relief what if edwards had won the nomination theyd be looking at the prospect of their nominee engulfed in a sexual scandal that makes bill clinton look like a prude since edwards didnt win the only harm to the democrats is that yet another one of their heroes has been exposed as a lying lout he joins a large club
4797440 i am vetoing this proposal because it is unfair to raise the vehicle registration fee from 75 to 95 for only city of milwaukee residents at a time when residents are already grappling with increases in food and fuel prices a 26 increase in the vehicle registration fee and a complete elimination of the responsibility of other property owners is not the road to go down
4797441 if milwaukee dramatically increases the number of kids who take the act well no longer be in the number one or two in the country were going to drop if the state of wisconsin wants to be one or two in the act theyre going to have to figure out ways to help milwaukee kids do better
4797442 here we are in 2008 and its early august and were already seeing problems im very concerned that were going to see more problems throughout 2008
4797443 this is the very reason i have fought for photo id in order to receive a ballot we have added more names on the voter rolls and we still have no idea if the person that is handed the ballot is truly that person
4797444 unfortunately the gop will use any excuse to call for the use of voter id if it rains too hard theyll say its because people arent required to show their drivers licenses when they vote

4797456 518 exhibitors have already booked space compared to 130 exhibitors last year
4797457 we hold dear the firm view that robert mugabe and mswati iii are not legitimate leaders of their various countries
4797458 they cannot claim any amount of legitimacy to rule their countries for they have not been democratically elected by the peoples of their countries
4797459 therefore as representatives of civil society we condemn the behaviour of these two leaders and take it upon ourselves to expose them and their unacceptable behaviour before the eyes of the world

4797469 all the parties appear to be agreeable to reaching an agreement this weekend but its a wait and see situation

4797473 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4797474 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4797475 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4797476 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4797477 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4797479 the mail is shipped by truck between the two facilities and the extra travel time would add an automatic one day to the delivery process in the best case scenario
4797480 the employees here at emp amp df do not feel that is in the best interest of the customer
4797481 although the usps maintains that these changes will result in little or no delay local business owners who havefirsthandd experience with similar modifications believe delays could reach 3 to 5 days
4797482 these extensive delays would be expensive and impractical for both businesses and individual customers
4797483 we arent happy that they are going to move processing im not sure how it makes sense to send mail down to southern maine only to have to send it back

4797501 the 65 000 new donors to the obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the american people are looking to fundamentally change business as usual in washington we are proud of the millions of volunteers and more than two million donors to the obama campaign who will provide the backbone of our campaign to put america back on track and reject the old politics and failed bush policies which is all john mccain is offering
4797502 this is how theyd overdo a storm in a mel brooks film
4797503 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4797504 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4797505 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4797506 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4797507 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4797508 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4797509 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4797510 obviously more of this water will be traversable in more parts of the year so we want to find it before hollywood
4797511 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4797512 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4797513 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4797514 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4797515 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4797516 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4797517 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4797518 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4797519 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4797520 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4797521 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4797522 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4797523 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4797524 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4797525 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4797526 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4797527 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4797528 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4797529 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4797530 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4797531 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4797532 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4797533 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4797534 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4797538 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4797539 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4797540 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4797541 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4797542 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4797543 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4797544 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4797545 yes there is media board event in the west building 3rd floor from one to three so i need the biggest amplifier and speaker system you have

4797547 the restaurant is located across from the boston common actually the part which is a historical graveyard it is close to the theater district and not far from beacon hill either troquet has two floors and the restaurant is located on the second floor the first floor has a small bar as well as
4797548 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4797549 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4797550 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4797551 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4797552 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4797553 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4797554 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4797555 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4797556 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4797557 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4797558 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4797559 los principales mercados son estados unidos y pa ses de europa y el precio internacional del caf oscila en los 125 d lares por quintal que si bien no es el justo responde a los costos de producci n y con ello la actividad sigue siendo rentable
4797560 lo cierto es que no hay da o ni a la calidad ni al volumen ni incide en el valor de la producci n
4797561 si todos los chiapanecos consumi ramos diario una tasa de caf tendr amos resuelto el mercado se garantizar a un mejor precio y los ingresos a la econom a estatal
4797562 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4797563 this is a planning took where all things are going
4797564 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4797565 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4797566 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4797567 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4797568 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4797569 the president issued an order to the relevant authorities to start the adoption of extra security measures envisaged in the six point plan
4797570 as these security measures are implemented the withdrawal of forces sent to carry out this reinforcement operation will be carried out
4797571 a major issue is russias contention that the region of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be part of georgias future
4797572 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so theres no room for debate on this matter
4797573 i am telling you with all responsibility that this could not have happened
4797574 when we were involved in combat actions as part of the peacekeeping operation bridges were our targets indeed but now when there is peace why should we blow up bridges it is us who would have to restore them we are working hard there
4797575 our units are on the outskirts of gori now where large arsenals of georgian weapons including 15 tanks have been discovered
4797576 were now relying on the collective wisdom of this leadership
4797577 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation we will do all we can to help
4797578 finally to make fully clear to robert mugabe that a new government in zimbabwe that must reflect the will of the zimbabwean population is necessary
4797579 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery
4797580 serious blot on the culture of democracy in our subregion
4797581 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4797582 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4797583 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4797584 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4797585 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4797586 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4797587 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4797588 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4797589 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4797590 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4797591 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4797592 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4797593 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4797594 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4797595 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4797596 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4797597 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4797598 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4797599 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4797600 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4797601 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4797602 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4797603 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4797604 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4797605 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4797606 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4797607 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4797608 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4797609 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4797610 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4797611 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4797612 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4797613 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4797614 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4797615 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4797616 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4797617 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4797618 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4797619 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4797620 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4797621 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4797622 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4797623 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4797624 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4797625 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4797626 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4797627 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4797628 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4797629 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck

4797643 we no longer know the limits of the invading russian army russia seems intent on overthrowing the democratically elected government of georgia and occupying the country
4797644 as a consequence the national security council has just decided to bring the georgian army to tbilisi in order to defend the capital and prevent the fall of georgia
4797645 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

4797651 no eye has seen no ear has heard and no mind has imagined the things that god has prepared for those who love him
4797652 i happen to believe in god because here and there over the years certain things happened not one particularly untoward thing happened just certain things to be more accurate the things that happened never really were quite certain and hence i suppose their queer power

4797656 how do you receive a full plate of food from a friend isaac whom you know didnt eat three days the week before
4797657 you do not understand how important it is for my family and i that you share this meal with us
4797658 i have a friend who has a big pancake face and feathery brown hair with patches of scalp showing she has peasanty patato features and shes too tall and totally inelegant but she loves her life shes chosen a life of prayer service and travel shes always in a sort of infuriating state of wonder of appreciating what is instead of fretting about what she wishes was but shes great looking everyone thinks so because of the expressions on her face and the way she looks at you she is radiant with spirituality and humor she was dealt the same basic cards we all were but somehow she could see that the cards were marked so she put them down and refused to play you cant win with marked cards
4797659 pride gets no pleasure out of having something only out of having more of it than the next man it is the comparison that makes you proud the pleasure of being above the rest once the element of comparison has gone pride has gone

4797661 living with mentally handicapped people was and in many ways is still the most important experience of my new life because it forced me to discover my true identity these broken wounded and completely unpretentious people forced me to let go of my relevant self the self that can do things show things prove things build things and forced me to reclaim that unadorned self in which i am completely vulnerable open to receive and give love regardless of any accomplishments i am telling you this because i am deeply convinced that the christian leader of the future is called to be completely irrelevant and to stand in this world with nothing to offer but his or her own vulnerable self that is the way jesus came to reveal gods love the greatest message that we have to carry as ministers of gods word and followers of jesus is that god loves us not because of what we do or accomplish but because god has created and redeemed us in love and has chosen us to proclaim that love as the true source of human life
4797662 a miracle is when the whole is greater than the sum of its parts a miracle is where one plus one equals a thousand
4797663 when you find something in a human face that calls out to you not just for help but in some sense for yourself how far do you go in answering that call how far can you go seeing that you have your own life to get on with as much as he has his
4797664 you may have it all just maybe not at the same time
4797665 it seems that the prodigal had to lose everything to come into touch with the ground of his being

4797683 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make
4797684 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
4797685 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
4797686 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
4797687 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it

4797695 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
4797696 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control
4797697 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars

4797700 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4797701 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4797702 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4797703 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4797704 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4797711 i felt as if the vast majority of people in our church had less access to my thoughts vision and life blogging was a great way to help them feel connected to me and also give me the opportunity to hear whats going on in their life
4797712 blogging is a great way for me to find creative ways to cast and recast the vision of cross point church ive found its very effective
4797713 people often felt like we didnt inform them about all the opportunities that were out there and they were right we just couldnt fit it all into the 60 minute service once a week blogging now allows us to extend our communication time with them
4797714 blogging and twittering have been a very effective and sometimes immediate way to get feedback on whats working and whats not
4797715 i know you wont be able to do it all at first but just start somewhere its an incredible way to connect with the people you are trying to establish relationships with and eventually lead into a life changing relationship with christ

4797727 the world needs to help georgia maintain its sovereignty its territorial integrity and its independence

4797740 he jumped out of the bed with no clothes on too he was all scared and he jumped out of the back window and into the swimming pool but i guess he didnt know that you took out the water last week to clean it he hit the bottom of the pool and i think hes dead

4797750 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
4797751 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
4797752 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
4797753 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
4797754 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
4797755 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
4797756 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
4797757 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
4797758 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
4797759 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
4797760 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
4797761 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
4797762 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
4797763 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
4797764 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
4797765 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
4797766 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
4797767 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
4797768 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
4797769 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
4797770 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
4797771 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
4797772 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
4797773 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
4797774 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
4797775 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
4797776 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
4797777 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
4797778 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
4797779 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
4797780 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
4797781 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
4797782 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
4797783 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
4797784 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
4797785 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
4797786 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
4797787 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
4797788 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
4797789 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
4797790 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
4797791 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
4797792 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
4797793 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
4797794 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
4797795 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
4797796 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
4797797 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps

4797816 i am writing to reassure the arizona department of public safety that redflex traffic systems inc wants to make things right given our discovery that the radar units we used in the pilot program were not certified by the federal communications commission
4797817 of course as soon as we learned that the unit we were using had not yet received certification we removed the 2 speed enforcement vehicles under this program using this radar
4797818 at worst redflex would be subject to a civil penalty by the fcc
4797819 we respect and will abide by dpss decision on whether to vacate any citations generated through the use of the radar unit and to refund corresponding fines

4797838 pdp is considered as pro india party but they lead march to muzafarrabad despite knowing fully well about the baltal land they are busy misleading the people
4797839 this proposal was considered by the government for three long years and finally cleared by two cabinet ministers belonging to pdp later the pdp jumped on the bandwagon with extremists to fuel communal sentiments

4797841 we have arrested nine suspects who are involved in the serial bomb blasts in the city on july 26 the master mind behind these blasts mufti abu bashir was also arrested this morning from azamgarh district of uttar pradesh
4797842 there are indications that bashir a simi activist may also have links to the jaipur hyderabad and bangalore blasts abu bashir will be brought to ahmedabad in a day or two for further interrogation
4797843 those arrested are active workers of the banned organisation simi and were deeply involved in its activities
4797844 arrest of a mastermind in the citys serial blasts case is a very important event and we believe that it will uncover many unsolved links to bomb blasts that took place in other parts of the country
4797845 their strategy was to place small explosives in different places to create panic among people and then have a powerful explosion at a hosptial where all those injured in the small explosions would be rushing to so they targeted the city civil hospital
4797846 there were few local and more oustiders involved in the serial blasts in the city and planting of bombs in surat we also believe that the bombs that were planted in surat were placed between july 25 and july 27
4797847 it is a moment of pride for the gujarat police who have been able to crack the serial blasts case all credit goes to the ahmedabad cime branch and the vadodara police who have been instumental in this case

4798048 im a big sight fisherman and im really good at it but if you told me id be sight fishing on lake murray in the middle of summer i would have told you that you were crazy but thats what ive been doing all week
4798049 and i have to see them before they see me basically if the fish see you its over its pretty frustrating actually
4798050 if its sunny out i can see the fish a little bit better and if its overcast ill probably have a better topwater bite but no matter what im not going to change it up now not when i see 50 fish over 3 pounds every day i really want to win this tournament and now i know what i have to shoot for lets put it this way im either going to win 1 million or im going to zero but im not changing a thing
4798051 i started the day by fishing some of the stuff i fished yesterday and it didnt work out so at about 9 oclock i gave up everything i was doing and just completely started over
4798052 i hit one little stretch put three decent fish in the boat and finished out a limit by noon from there i just drove around the lake looking for new stuff to fish
4798053 every time i catch a fish or two off a spot its done
4798054 im slowly learning that there is no reason to return to places where i have caught fish i can find consistency in fishing new water so thats what im going to continue to do
4798055 the patterns seem to change every day and the only way i can adapt to that is to fish each hour with an open mind even if that means completely starting over every couple of hours
4798056 i went to the spot that produced the big bass yesterday fished for two hours and only caught two keepers
4798057 from there i ran way up the river and caught two more
4798058 im going to return to my best spot tomorrow and camp
4798059 i know there are some big fish in there and all i want is just three bites from that place
4798060 im fishing both shallow and deep but the better fish seem to be coming shallow ive had a 4 pounder each day which is why im in the top 10
4798061 im probably hitting about 10 to 30 spots per day
4798062 some of the stretches ive caught fish off of before others are just random new places im not familiar with
4798063 i came here in pre practice fished four days of practice and i still have nothing solid to key in on i honestly have no idea when or where my next bite is going to happen
4798064 i fished deep for 90 percent of practice and it was terrible
4798065 so when the tournament started yesterday i just went shallow and treated it like another day of practice and the way i look at it im still practicing just fishing whatever looks good
4798066 im burning a lot of gas and covering a lot of water
4798067 so far the only key for me has been to fish new water now that ive caught a few fish off some spots those little gremlins in my head are starting to tell me to go back to those places but im not so sure that i would not be better off to keep fishing all new stuff because thats been the best
4798068 its like the patterns change drastically from day to day i could not catch a fish the way i caught them yesterday so i changed up to a topwater and just went fishing
4798069 i did key in on a special kind of grass today
4798070 its that same kind of bank grass thats all over the lake but what im looking for has to do with where the grass is positioned along a bank the only problem is i have only found that unique combination in a couple of very select areas so duplicating it is tough
4798071 the way this lake is fishing ill be doing something completely different tomorrow
4798072 the excitement that is being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp its going to be fun come saturday
4798073 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4798074 you can do it all you want out here in practice but theres no substitute
4798075 its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4798076 i did tell eric the day before i came up i want to play as soon as possible
4798077 i would have played three plays the other night in cleveland but that would have been ugly
4798078 i dont know i think well just play it by ear i think the smart thing to do is just get your feet wet try to get something going like i always said in preseason youd love to win the game but there are other things
4798079 we can translate things to him and help him get a good feel for what were trying to do offensively i think thats been going very well
4798080 its definitely cool to play a hall of fame quarterback it will be interesting getting out there with the gunslinger
4798081 its cool that a preseason game has more hype its going to be intense its going to be a big game up there
4798082 with a deal that is as big as the deal is in fremont anything could go wrong
4798083 i want to continue to keep the door open so that we can keep the as the best case scenario would be that they stay in oakland i would like to try to help them stay in oakland

4798177 expect to be in a class of mostly chinese students in the day classes they will be mostly wives of taiwanese businessmen at night they will be mainland chinese and the class may be larger dont expect to find a textbook learning is a challenge but its primarily up to the individual individual participation in those night classes moves slowly sounds like tuition has doubled as well but thats still a bargain for a term of study take at least two terms
4798178 eric i hate to be a bearer of bad news about the spanish program at the uofp irina is one of the few and only english speakers who had a good class there that i know of these classes are usually packed with chinese after i was sent to the wrong classes three times by the administration of the language department they sent me to an advance class twice once to a english class irina bought my book for her class finally after the fourth try i had a classroom and an instructor to work with this only took five trips to language department to correct this would be funny except i had a native born panamanian educated in the usa with me to translate for me on my adventures with the uofp every time i went no one there speaks english in the language department funny no i then had to make copies of the instructors book because she did not like the book the the uofp used then she did not show up over half the time to teach they really have serious problems there cheap yes but you must have a lot of free time and be willing to get the run a round for your money their is one instructor that i think irina had that is the one i wanted i do not remember his name the administration of the language department told me his classes were full that was almost a year ago he is real popular and it is hard to get into his classes his english is not great but he really tries to work with you may be irina can tell you his name spanish classes here are not what you would expect it seems they are more of a high school variety private lessons here should never be more than ten usd per hour if you are a gringo they always try to charge 20 to 30 usd per hour so good luck i still love it here

4798186 tensions between the united states and russia sharpened as the bush administration suggested that russias objective is the ousting of president mikhail saakashvili who has close ties to the united states and is seeking admission to nato
4798187 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
4798188 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4798189 as far as the georgians are concerned south ossetia and abkhazia are simply part of their national territory to be recovered at all costs promises by nato leaders to bring georgia into the alliance and ostentatious declarations of support from washington have emboldened saakashvili to launch his military offensive against the two provinces south ossetia and abkhazia saakashvili and likely dick cheneys office in washington appear to have miscalculated very badly russia has made it clear that it has no intention of ceding its support for south ossetia or abkhazia
4798190 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
4798191 the new cold war has long since been instigated by the usa through the americans so called missile defence shield in the czech republic and poland
4798192 i think were going to come back from these games and push our guys even harder than we did before to improve on what the ticketing standard has been for past olympics
4798193 if its not managed well and the seats arent full that could be one of our biggest negatives in 2010
4798194 if youre sitting far away at the top of the arena and you see all those empty seats or you see them on tv when you wanted to be at the actual event you are not going to be very happy even just from a public relations standpoint this is a potential headache and a real tough area to manage
4798195 those sections are far too big we need to shrink them down to size i was at swimming the other night you look across at the media section and you feel half the arena is taken up its a big atmosphere killer
4798196 but we will have a strategy to manage tickets on the ground at game time
4798197 we will know what tickets are in and what tickets are out at each venue every day this is something we are actively working towards and hopefully we will set a new olympic trend for tickets
4798198 were getting the message out to businesses because they are the ones being targeted by these unsanctioned ticketing companies
4798199 a ticket that was valid 10 minutes ago and looks valid and feels valid and even the hologram is right isnt necessarily valid when you go in because we may have killed the barcode
4798200 ticket brokers are going to be selling some tickets that are invalid i dont think theres any doubt about that
4798201 and thats the risk people take when they buy from those brokers
4798202 were not going to try to police people trying to unload a few tickets or something like that were trying to put most of our effort into the bigger places where were seeing a lot of fraud people out misrepresenting what tickets theyve got and what access they have

4798206 we are not planning to attack anyone but our partners should clearly understand that the armed forces will be used if necessary to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the russian federation and its allies including on a preventative basis including with the use of nuclear weapons
4798207 military force can and must be used to demonstrate the decisiveness of the top leadership of the country
4798208 what baluyev sky means is the enhanced deterrence doctrine which was created in the united states
4798209 soon we will not be able to maintain missile defense
4798210 under these conditions a potential enemy will gain the ability to carry out high precision strikes coordinated in terms of time and space on practically any target on russian territory
4798211 as for our allies we will see whos ready to join our nuclear umbrella
4798212 a new offence of causing death by careless driving comes into force across the uk next week it means motorists who kill while avoidably distracted could for the first time face prison historically careless driving has only been punishable with a fine whatever the consequences the new offence means uk motorists who kill after allowing themselves to lose concentration can be imprisoned for up to five years so what sort of distractions might count against a driver who causes a fatal crash the ministry of justice gives these examples reading a text message glancing at a map eating drinking tuning a radio putting on make up

4798216 i was introduced to the world of graphic design by my elder brother who was studying interactive media design at the time when i was around 10 to 11 years old when all the boys my age were out in the sun playing soccer i chose to stay inside and face the old bulky monitor screen i can still recall the times when i was playing around in 3d studio max amp jasc paint shop pro back then i was obviously making horrible images those horrid pixelated low res spiky things that you use the lasso tool with and then use the wind effect to create awful swirly blob graphics then slowly i began to mould and adapt myself to photoshop and from there i began to explore the immense possibilities thats when i fell in love with graphic design especially the feeling that you get when you see something beautiful i am still exploring and learning aspiring to become a fashion photographer and not just stick to graphic design maybe one day i will start my own designer clothing line or make music i dont know yet but i am looking forward to bigger things that will be in store for me in the future

4798218 women choose to wear a two piece bathing suit because it is the least restrictive uniform possible its because the sand doesnt get trapped as much with a one piece the sand collects in the bottom of the suit and gets caught when male players train they traditionally choose to wear a longer boardshort to their knees and go shirtless but the governing international body for the sport prefers a cleaner look with their country names and numbers on their shirts during competition
4798219 what we have here from rachel in her latest book is something that we believe has its finger on the pulse of the country today
4798220 its time for the stigma of not cooking and relying on pre packaged food to be banished in this country what rachel ray is saying is that its okay to stand up and say i dont cook without the shame that usually comes with such a bold proclamation
4798221 and contrary to what all those government health agencies are saying its not a bad thing to eat the kind of food that rachel talks about in just heat it up i mean this countrys post war expansion was built upon high fat high salt preservative laden meals and we just think its time to stop acting like its a bad thing
4798222 we built this so we would have a very stable structure
4798223 pg amp e is finally doing what a bunch of us have said back in 1987
4798224 i think this is a very positive thing in the community
4798225 once the fuel is out then the rest of the plant can be dismantled thats a whole other ball game

4798230 portanto um tema importante e ser abordado com a aten o merecida
4798231 todo cen rio ser muito simples e o foco estar na palavra
4798232 i was really quite shocked and saddened by what the prince had to say it was really rather ill informed and very negative
4798233 and im saddened that the prince of wales who is in a leadership role and able to solve some of the problems he identifies by bringing scientists technicians and agricultural and climate change experts together instead tried to blame the problems of the planet on a technology he clearly does not understand
4798234 he has a lot of understandable concerns about the way the planet is going but it would be good to see him looking broadly and objectively at how those concerns can be addressed and leading a constructive debate rather than dismiss something out of hand that we need to keep the door open on
4798235 gm is not a silver bullet but it is one of many things we need to look at to produce sustainable crops in the future obviously we have to take cautious rational decisions in developing that technology
4798236 crops at the moment are not going to sustain themselves in this time of unprecedented change we need to have crops which can survive and will have less impact on the environment
4798237 really astute businessmen who would not have anything foisted upon them
4798238 i think it is extremely short sighted to blame gm crops for everything that is going on in the world as far as the environment is concerned
4798239 whomsoever god desires to guide he expands his breast to islam
4798240 today i have perfected your religion d n for you i have completed my blessing upon you i have approved islam for your religion
4798241 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate
4798242 youll be able to walk past fruit at the supermarket scan an apple and see when it was picked and where it came from
4798243 while buying hair dye youll be able to scan the code on the signage and see instructions you can create your own code put it on a t shirt and then let people scan your shirt and link directly to your myspace page
4798244 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4798245 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4798246 it is solely intended to provide political cover to democrats that are losing more ground by the day on this issue
4798247 denn das wichtigste war nicht zu sturz zu kommen gerade im regen passiert es ganz schnell dass man hinf llt also fuhr er ein bisschen konservativer als sonst er wollte n mlich keine weiteren verletzungen seiner linken hand riskieren
4798248 ich verst rkte heute meine bandage aber durch das kalte wetter waren die schmerzen trotzdem st rker
4798249 die strecke war nass ich habe versucht meine zeit zu verbessern aber der regen nahm zu und eine verbesserung war nicht m glich jetzt stehe ich in der vierten reihe dar ber bin ich nicht gl cklich denn es wird uns im rennen nicht helfen sollte es morgen trocken sein dann w nsche ich mir auch ein trockenes warmup damit wir noch an radaufh ngung und reifenwahl arbeiten k nnen
4798250 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4798251 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4798252 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record
4798253 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4798254 you gotta be fucked up if you think im driving this damn road
4798255 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4798256 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4798257 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4798258 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4798259 id rather go along with the vet check up than have you crying all night

4798266 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4798267 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4798268 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4798269 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot

4798271 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4798272 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4798273 as an evangelical i am much more interested in his list of questions than in either of their answers

4798284 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
4798285 there doesnt have to be an environmental catastrophe for air pollution to cause injury were talking about very modest increases air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
4798286 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
4798287 i guess china is obsessed with winning olympics gold medals and we should take inspiration from it in india there is no dearth of talent but a lot needs to be done to utilise it in a proper manner

4798305 the worlds migration body said friday that daily life has improved little for thousands of iraqis living in tent camps despite a slowdown in the number of people in iraq being uprooted

4798307 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier
4798308 the 65 000 new donors to the obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the american people are looking to fundamentally change business as usual in washington we are proud of the millions of volunteers and more than two million donors to the obama campaign who will provide the backbone of our campaign to put america back on track and reject the old politics and failed bush policies which is all john mccain is offering
4798309 he can be called the best olympian of all time
4798310 not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and in the way hes actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure
4798311 im so excited i can hear my national anthem play im so proud itll be exciting back home
4798312 toward the finish line i couldnt tell if i made it to the finals or not
4798313 i looked up there and realized i didnt it was kind of devastating i may have needed more races but i dont really have any excuses i just didnt make it
4798314 when i get back to the village its really probably going to set in

4798316 when you race in the olympics and the trials you peak your body two times i was prepared to peak my body twice but the injury set me back three or four weeks
4798317 iraqi security forces will partner with the 41st fires brigade and occupy several checkpoints and patrol bases previously manned by the 1st georgian brigade
4798318 right now the iraqi soldiers have taken over the responsibility of the traffic control point but we are going to train them to be able to take over the entire patrol base
4798319 the georgian forces had no experience they didnt know how to fight they didnt follow army orders thats why their duties were to man checkpoints and search cars
4798320 the departure of the georgians is a good thing theyre just the same as the other occupation forces the iraqi forces are quite capable of taking care of security

4798322 unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains alone but if it does it bears much fruit he who loves his life loses it and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life
4798323 what kind of god is he who allows the many who are worthy and just to suffer and without lifting a finger finds satisfaction in their sufferings is it his will that these islands continue in miserable condition
4798324 the vessel must be shaken or broken to release the perfume the stone must be struck to raise a spark there is something providential in the persecution of tyrants
4798325 who improves with his punishments and grants happiness only to those who have merited it with their exertions the school of suffering tempers the sprit the fighting arena strengthens the soul
4798326 love what is just what is good what is great to the point of dying for it
4798327 god provides the weapon and the idols and the tyrants fall like a house of cards and freedom shines in the first dawn
4798328 were to see us less tolerant of tyranny and readier to fight and suffer for our rights spain would be the first to give us freedom because when the fruit of conception reaches the time of birth woe to the mother that tries to strangle it
4798329 as long as the filipinos do no have sufficient vigor to proclaim head held high and chest bared their right to a life of their own in human society and to guarantee it with their sacrifices with their very blood as long as we see our countrymen feel ashamed privately while in public they keep silent and even join the oppressor in mocking the oppressed as long as we see them wrapping themselves up in their selfishness and praising with forced smiles the most despicable acts begging with their eyes for a share of thebooty why give them independence
4798330 what is the use of independence if the slaves of today will be the tyrants of tomorrow and no doubt they will because whoever submits to tyranny loves it x x x why give the bride to the groom if he does not love her enough and is not ready to die for her
4798331 when you think all is lost the greater reward often follows all is not lost though some things happen contrary to your will you should not think of yourself wholly foraken by me though i send you for a time some grief and trouble for this is the surer way to the kingdom of heaven

4798336 we got up at 6 30 a m and left home at 7 but didnt get here until after 9 the subway was crowded with olympic spectators and we had to wait in long queues for the security check
4798337 we made online reservations last summer some people ended up with 10 or even 20 while others didnt get anything its a pity i didnt get a ticket for the finals
4798338 i was so excited last night that i kept awake at 3 a m and got up again at 6

4798348 and with trade pundits predicting a first week run of rs 40 crore for the akshay stunner the singh is kinng juggernaut might just steamroll competition with collections mounting to nearly rs 100 crores at the end of a three four week run
4798349 we believe that the film will beat oso and welcome by 30 in its second week which have been the highest grossers till date the film was made for rs 50 crore we expect the film to make profits to all stakeholders from the second week
4798350 this year has not been so entertaining for the audience so far singh is kinng is a complete entertainer for the mass and the music was a hit even before the film was released which has boosted the box office as well
4798351 jesse just noticed your email address on the dashboard um odd one no

4798364 over dat eerste halfuur ben ik ook tevreden toen hadden we de wedstrijd onder controle daarna waren we echter niet in staat om hamburg vast te zetten er zijn bij ons inderdaad enkele mensen afwezig door blessures maar dat mag geen excuus zijn
4798365 we zijn niet tevreden want we hadden deze wedstrijd moeten winnen normaal geven we een 2 0 voorsprong zelden of nooit weg het voordeel is wel dat we ons nu enkel nog kunnen verbeteren

4798379 when we saw that chopper there was a lot of tears and screaming
4798380 i have always been aware of how dangerous it can be and how vulnerable you can be out there because i think at times im a bit invincible
4798381 but no i would never give up going out climbing or walking
4798382 i was so shocked when i heard from him he just said im safe now im just calling you to say im safe
4798383 we could see the chopper but you cant make contact or get help
4798384 then it goes away and you know it will be night time soon and were stuck here for another night

4798388 i could not bear the thought of this suffering child dying alone in a soiled utility room so i cradled and rocked him for the 45 minutes that he lived

4798395 whether its a racing suit versus a training suit or a new style of helmet theres always some new technological development
4798396 its a part of the world we live in but because theres so much money tied to the research and development of trying to find the next great thing its more on the radar than ever
4798397 incredibly simple no excessive stylistic plastic to add any additional weight
4798398 these shoes are more responsive than any shoes i have worn i took them out on their first test drive during an interval workout in big bear my legs felt like they were popping off the road and yet still had the support of a marathon shoe
4798399 prohibits the incorporation of any technology which will give the wearer any unfair advantage such as a spring
4798400 it doesnt return more than 100 percent of energy you put into it its not spring loaded
4798401 the fundamental difference with our technology over traditional footwear is that instead of using compressive materials such as foam the midsole is mechanical and works off of deflection not compression
4798402 its just like the battle with the oversized tennis racket or the metal driver
4798403 they were banned once too now thats all you see rules can never keep pace with technological change
4798404 you can no longer just look at a static body structure
4798405 everyone pedals a bike differently so one guy who is 6 feet tall is going to pedal a bike differently from another guy who is 6 feet we record movement we adjust the bike to maximize power and improve aerodynamics
4798406 ten years ago no one thought of wearing something like a heart rate monitor to work out
4798407 now most of my clients wear them the technology eventually trickles down to the mass market which is great
4798408 if it is something that is going to give women better protection then we should see if that is something we can get hold of
4798409 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4798410 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4798411 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4798412 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4798413 we didnt know what to do they weighed about 5 tons they were just huge
4798414 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4798415 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4798416 we dont want to have any doubts about the decision and the integrity of fina
4798417 they say this is how it happened and we assume everybody was treated equally in the race
4798418 were satisfied with the silver medal it would have been nice to win gold but we only wanted silver for this race
4798419 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4798420 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4798421 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4798422 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4798423 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4798424 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4798425 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4798426 im not about fighting it im not angry at all

4798430 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4798431 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations
4798432 there are entire magazines with no commentary no criticism clearly not a case of classic fair use
4798433 the first sale doctrine says that once i buy a physical copy of something i can do whatever i want with it except copy it
4798434 we take our intellectual property seriously and are considering appropriate action on this matter
4798435 esfu rzate y s muy valiente para cuidar de hacer conforme a toda la ley que mi siervo mois s te mand no te apartes de ella ni a diestra ni a siniestra para que seas prosperado en todas las cosas que emprendas
4798436 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4798437 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
4798438 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
4798439 the city does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests
4798440 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4798441 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing
4798442 the excitement that is being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp its going to be fun come saturday
4798443 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4798444 you can do it all you want out here in practice but theres no substitute
4798445 its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4798446 i did tell eric the day before i came up i want to play as soon as possible
4798447 i would have played three plays the other night in cleveland but that would have been ugly
4798448 i dont know i think well just play it by ear i think the smart thing to do is just get your feet wet try to get something going like i always said in preseason youd love to win the game but there are other things
4798449 we can translate things to him and help him get a good feel for what were trying to do offensively i think thats been going very well
4798450 its definitely cool to play a hall of fame quarterback it will be interesting getting out there with the gunslinger
4798451 its cool that a preseason game has more hype its going to be intense its going to be a big game up there
4798452 were going to have a lot of the basics on the menu some really nice salads at lunchtime thai chicken salad and shrimp salads
4798453 and some of the pizzas we made popular at corleones flatbread pizzas are a big seller for us and some nice corned beef and french dip sandwiches
4798454 for dinnertime im hoping well get into a harry carays kind of place
4798455 expect to find 20 big screen tvs a draft beer system featuring at least 15 to 20 specialty drafts and local brews as well as a radio transmission area where golic can do live broadcasts
4798456 but i heard the deal was on the table for a while
4798457 i appreciate the organization for moving me if they werent going to have a significant role for me in the last year of my contract at the same time im upset they werent able to find a role for me
4798458 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4798459 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4798460 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4798461 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4798462 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4798463 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4798464 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4798465 as an evangelical i am much more interested in his list of questions than in either of their answers
4798466 youre the most polite well behaved sensible calm person who ever rocked a sweater set and matching pearls
4798467 building this white tower over the white city is a dream come true
4798468 building this white tower over the white city and ask people for 13 000 a square metre is a dream come true
4798469 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today
4798470 now russia needs to honor that agreement and withdraw its forces and of course military operations
4798471 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4798472 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4798473 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states fully recognizes this reality
4798474 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done but i would just note there are already consequences
4798475 there have been universal concern within the eu european union the united states about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4798476 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4798477 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4798478 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4798479 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4798480 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4798481 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4798482 que lo mejor que le ocurri en el a o pasado sea lo peor que le ocurra en este nuevo a o
4798483 no one will talk on the record about any potential move of tribe prospects from buffalo to columbus
4798484 the process has been outlined well go through september and then people will talk
4798485 but i would have my head in the sand to think there arent some back channel things going on
4798486 ive seen him up in the zone a lot more with everything and because of that his secondary stuff is not playing
4798487 well have to re evaluate him and see how we can get him going again
4798488 ya know jhonny i liked you so much better when you were just a ballplayer if you wanna be an interior decorator now thats none of my business but some of us still need this team now you listen to me this is my last shot at a winner and for some of the younger guys it could be their only shot i dont know what happened to you but if you ever ever tank another play like you did today im gonna cut your off and stuff em down your throat
4798489 danny ferry has been one of the most vilified figures in cleveland sports through the last 5 years
4798490 lebrons gonna go to ny lebrons going to go to europe etc
4798491 i am certain that such a scenario is not possible in ukraine
4798492 prosperity peace and calm in crimea is the very foundation on which the interests of ukraine and neighboring russia coincide everything else is of secondary importance
4798493 if we complete this stage and go on to the next one we can be confident that there will be no russian or any other destabilization scenario in crimea
4798494 i have therefore sent an urgent proposal to the president of russia to start talks on signing an agreement that would regulate our relations in the event of military action like that which we saw at the beginning of august
4798495 in other words we need to come up with clearer rules that would ensure ukraines national security in such situations
4798496 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4798497 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared
4798498 in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
4798499 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4798500 were in talks with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4798501 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4798502 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4798503 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles
4798504 this is an acid test for him to prove his commitment to democracy
4798505 as these measures of addition security are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4798506 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4798507 these questions are not decided by condoleezza rice or somebody else they are decided first of all by the side that has suffered in the conflict
4798508 what peacekeepers from what countries are needed for the people of south ossetia to feel comfortable is a primarily up to the people of south ossetia

4798510 a doctor at tskhinvali regional hospital who was on duty from the afternoon of august 7 told human rights watch that between august 6 to 12 the hospital treated 273 wounded both military and civilians the doctor also said that 44 bodies had been brought to the hospital since the fighting began of both military and civilians the figure reflects only those killed in the city of tskhinvali but the doctor was adamant that the majority of people killed in the city had been brought to the hospital before being buried because the city morgue was not functioning due to the lack of electricity in the city

4798512 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4798513 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4798514 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party

4798519 frantic campaign has targeted many charities and service organizations by storming closing and confiscating the belongings of these organizations
4798520 without any legal justification just under the claim that they were closeto hamas in many cases the campaign targeted private businesses under a shameless accusation that the owners receive money from hamas

4798527 theres not enough food for a humpback whale in the baltic sea
4798528 the baltic sea is a connecting sea to the north sea fish and the whale could have easily followed the current flowing into the baltic sea
4798529 it is also possible that the whale became confused because of underwater noises
4798530 we believe that the network of simi was behind the blasts
4798531 today is a big day for the gujarat police who have been able to crack the ahmadabad blasts case
4798532 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
4798533 his contribution to our improvement has been very important for the team
4798534 toseland stuff is by far the biggest seller hes even outselling valentino rossi
4798535 ive been doing donington for 20 years and this year is going to be better than most because of him
4798536 the biggest seller is the toseland flags weve only got a few thousand of them left and theyre going to sell out pretty quickly

4798567 the tibia is a bit dislocated and the doctor would like to correct this
4798568 hed also like to operate on his knee as theres a big compression there
4798569 for germany we would like to keep the bike free because it will be difficult to find anybody
4798570 but our idea for laguna would be to put one of our american based riders on the bike maybe jamie hacking roger lee hayden or chaz davies
4798571 after i knew how bad johns injuries were i told marco that we have a bike free for the next two events but that he would have to find a solution with ducati to get out of his contract
4798572 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4798573 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4798574 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4798575 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4798576 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4798577 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4798578 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4798579 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4798580 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4798581 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4798582 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4798583 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4798584 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4798627 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4798628 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4798629 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4798630 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4798631 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4798632 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4798633 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4798634 executive privilege claims that form the foundation of the executives resistance to the committees subpoenas are not foreign to federal courts either
4798635 in the thirty four years since united states v nixon was decided the courts have routinely considered questions of executive privilege or immunity
4798636 is not merely an investigation into the executives use of his removal power but rather a broader inquiry into whether improper partisan considerations have influenced prosecutorial discretion
4798637 defies both reason and precedent to say as the executive does that the committee which is charged with oversight of doj generally cannot permissibly employ its investigative resources on this subject
4798638 unique ability to address improper partisan influence in the prosecutorial process n o other institution will fill the vacuum if congress is unable to investigate and respond to this evil
4798639 the 110th congress expires on january 3 2009 unlike the senate the house is not a continuing body
4798640 on the committees side the entire house and thus any outstanding subpoenas will lapse on january 3 2009 and the basis of this lawsuit will cease to exist to be sure the incoming house of representatives may elect to re issue similar subpoenas but that remains speculative at this juncture similarly the incoming executive administration may decline to pursue the assertions of immunity and executive privilege that form the foundation of this dispute
4798641 a former president may still assert executive privilege but the claim necessarily has less force particularly when the sitting president does not support the claim of privilege
4798642 as with the incoming congress there is no way to predict whether the new administration will support the assertions of privilege made in this case there is also the likelihood of appeal of this decision and given the significance of the issues involved a stay pending appeal is at least possible thus although proceedings before this court could be concluded prior to january 2009 any appeals process may not run its course before that date at that point the case would arguably become moot nevertheless the court concludes that this concern does not counsel against entertaining this case
4798643 lets get all this behind us so that the congress will not be fooling around with bush once the new president arrives
4798644 some people may say bad things about me even my own village is against me
4798645 it was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout by doing what he did

4798647 its my marabout that did this to me it forged me it allowed me to learn that i can overcome difficulty

4798649 ask yourself what is this money used for the kids are not fed so its not for food they wear rags so its not for clothes they dont have mattresses so its not for their beds
4798650 this is a sham on a grand scale under the cover of religion
4798651 the parents of these children believe in these men so completely that when they hand over their sons they relinquish all control
4798652 they swear allegiance to the marabout and say that whatever happens to their son is for the childs good
4798653 my grandson can say whatever he wants but i know the truth
4798654 he was hit because he was lazy and refused to memorize his verses

4798802 the 65 000 new donors to the obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the american people are looking to fundamentally change business as usual in washington we are proud of the millions of volunteers and more than two million donors to the obama campaign who will provide the backbone of our campaign to put america back on track and reject the old politics and failed bush policies which is all john mccain is offering
4798803 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
4798804 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
4798805 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
4798806 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
4798807 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
4798808 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use

4798810 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
4798811 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
4798812 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
4798813 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
4798814 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
4798815 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
4798816 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
4798817 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
4798818 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
4798819 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
4798820 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
4798821 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
4798822 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
4798823 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
4798824 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
4798825 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
4798826 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
4798827 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
4798828 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
4798829 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
4798830 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
4798831 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
4798832 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
4798833 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
4798834 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
4798835 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
4798836 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
4798837 the best education i received was working with people in the community on a grassroots basis because what it taught me was that ordinary people when they are working together can do extraordinary things
4798838 during the past eight years our energy policy has been directed by the two oil men in the white house their failed policy has increased our dependence on foreign oil damaged our economy and left consumers paying record prices at the pump when it comes to energy as my children would say lets get real
4798839 the seven count indictment charges sen stevens the former chairperson of the senate committee on appropriations with engaging in a nearly eight year scheme to conceal his receipt of more than 250 000 in things of value from veco corporation formerly a multi national oil services company based in alaska and bill j allen the chief executive officer of veco at the time
4798840 specifically charges stevens with making false statements on his financial disclosure forms for calendar years 2001 to 2006 the indictment alleges that during each of those years stevens knowingly failed to report his receipt of anything of value from allen veco or two other individuals despite the fact that the forms required stevens to report his receipt of such things of value

4798865 if those are not your values if you want a country which has sharia law or a theocratic state then australia is not for you
4798866 id be saying to clerics who are teaching that there are two laws governing people in australia one the australian law and another islamic law that is false if you cant agree with parliamentary law independent courts democracy and would prefer sharia law and have the opportunity to go to another country which practices it perhaps then thats a better option
4798867 clear off basically people who dont want to be australians and who dont want to live by australian values and understand them well then they can basically clear off
4798868 immigrants not australians must adapt take it or leave it i am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture since the terrorist attacks on bali we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of australians
4798869 however the dust from the attacks had barely settled when the politically correct crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others i am not against immigration nor do i hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to australia
4798870 however there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country and apparently some born here need to understand
4798871 this idea of australia being a multi cultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity and as australians we have our own culture our own society our own language and our own lifestyle
4798872 this culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom
4798873 we speak mainly english not spanish lebanese arabic chinese japanese russian or any other language therefore if you wish to become part of our society learn the language
4798874 most australians believe in god this is not some christian right wing political push but a fact because christian men and women on christian principles founded this nation and this is clearly documented it is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools if god offends you then i suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home because god is part of our culture

4798954 with the fall in oil and other commodity prices in the past month both the markets and fed officials had started to turn away from inflation risks and focus on growth risks

4799018 if mapping conversion theory shows anything it shows the need for grace humility and openness to one another as we listen to and learn from one anothers stories the sincerity of each converts often opposite experience underscores the need to learn from ones anothers experience rather than denounce the others experience
4799019 all conversions are apostasies and all apostasies are therefore conversions
4799020 they doubt or deny the truth of the previous system of beliefs they criticize the morality of the former life they express emotional upheaval upon leaving a former faith and they speak of being rejected by their former community
4799021 each for a variety of reasons encountered issues and ideas and experiences that simply shook the faith beyond stability
4799022 drove christine wicker a journalist who covers the religious scene in milwaukee wisconsin from the faith seen in her well written memoir
4799023 i am now an atheist one major reason why i have become an atheist is because i could not answer the questions i was encountering
4799024 while on the mission field he became convinced the bible could not be inerrant or infallible walked away from the mission field and became an agnostic
4799025 became a skeptic and at the heart of his departure from orthodoxy was a critical approach to scripture
4799026 was the bibles record of jesus predictions and pauls own expectations that he think did not come true that undid the truthfulness of the bible
4799027 encounter the empirical evidence of the sciences particularly concerning evolution and the origins as well as development of life as we now know it a rigid view of scripture collapses for some the whole ship sinks
4799028 became disillusioned with christianity and the bible because of the lack of evidence for what was considered so central to the faith the scientific accuracy of a simplistic theory of creation
4799029 a simplistic theory of origins along with special pleading theories that are designed to explain away that evidence when combined then with knowledge of the ancient near east parallels to both the creation accounts and the story of noahs flood not infrequently are the collision point for many who leave the orthodox christian faith
4799030 for many the failure of christians to be transformed by the claimed grace of god and the indwelling power of the spirit obliterates the truthfulness of the christian claim
4799031 as i looked at the secular students gathered there i suddenly thought listen is there really that much difference between them and us i had always accepted the qualitative difference between the saved and the unsaved until that moment then in a flash we were all just people
4799032 belief in hell has led some to contend the christian faith is inherently unjust and morally repugnant
4799033 far more fundamental to those who leave the faith than is normally recognized
4799034 the whole notion of a punishment after we die is sick and barbaric the whole concept of hell developed among superstitious and barbaric peoples and tells us nothing about life after death
4799035 ones faith is more shaped by ones social location than by ones personal choice
4799036 the demand put on ones life by jesus by the orthodox faith and by a local churchs expectations can provoke a crisis on the part of the person who wants to go her or his own way i am suggesting that behind some of the stories is a desire to live as one wants to break certain moral codes that are experienced as confining and that were either forgotten when telling the story or were an unacknowledged dimension of the experience
4799037 one might summarize the entire process of leaving the faith as the quest for personal autonomy freedom and intellectual stability these factors seem present at some level in nearly all the stories i have studied
4799038 they abandon their faith so that they can go out and sin freely
4799039 less rancor but still finding a need to tell that story in losing faith in faith
4799040 the anti rhetoric or the rhetoric that is so negatively against what they formerly believed is both a characteristic of all kinds of conversion but especially those whose conversion is leaving orthodox christianity not all however are as white hot in their antipathy to orthodoxy
4799041 it was like tearing my whole frame of reality to pieces ripping to shreds the fabric of meaning and hope betraying the values of existence and it hurt bad it was like spitting on my mother or like throwing one of my children out a window it was sacrilege all of my bases for thinking and values had to be restructured add to that inner conflict the outer conflict of reputation and you have a destabilizing war
4799042 fine collection of stories of those who have left the faith demonstrates an interlocking relationship at times babinski himself was influenced by william bagley and by robert price while others were influenced by dan barker there is presently then a connection for those who are reconsidering their faith a connection that is filled with folks who have already traveled that path know its rocks and its cliffs and who can guide the pilgrim away from faith
4799043 harry mccall a biblical scholar who voluntarily chose to leave bob jones university chose to abandon his faith because jesus is so obviously a product of human imagination coupled with arbitrary faith that i chose to simply acknowledge the obvious rather than remain religious
4799044 i had to swallow hard after twelve years as an evangelical but almost immediately life began to open up in an exciting way i felt like a college freshman thinking through important questions for the first time the anxiety of doubt had passed into the adventure of discovery it was like being born again
4799045 when it is resolved i mean the underlying conflict it must be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of georgia
4799046 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4799047 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4799048 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4799049 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4799050 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4799051 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done but i would just note there are already consequences there have been universal concern within the eu the united states about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4799052 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4799053 i figure if im ever gonna do this this is the day to do this
4799054 my story is not really fantasy football a unique story at all
4799055 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4799056 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4799057 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4799058 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4799059 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4799060 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4799061 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4799062 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4799063 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4799064 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do
4799065 when the car conditions are very suitable for felipe his abilities are 110 but once the car is not so good his abilities are 90
4799066 but kimi could get the package performance at 100 even if the car condition is not so good
4799067 i really dig this spot because it reminds me of that little market i used to go to as a kid run by a family small enough to have really

4799075 im pleased to announce that negotiations are complete and that we have initialed an agreement
4799076 president bush has said that we recognize the need for the polish armed services to be modernized and we have offered to help in that regard
4799077 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
4799078 i believe that one of the reasons weve seen the proliferation of these missiles in the past is that there has historically been no defense against them
4799079 so they are of a lot of value to nations like iran and north korea if we join together united states nato russia and field effective missile defenses i believe it will have an effect on the value of these weapons it will devalue them in the eyes of some of these countries
4799080 yeah our guy screwed up royally but their guy did too our gm is no more of a screw up than crows agent

4799248 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4799249 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4799250 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4799251 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4799252 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation
4799253 i have done everything i can to comply with the law and be a good citizen
4799254 i would never hurt anyone but none of that matters now
4799255 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4799256 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4799257 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4799258 are you kidding me this makes apw look amazing foo fighters and alison krause as headliners haha

4799321 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4799322 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4799323 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4799324 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4799325 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4799326 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4799327 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4799328 as an evangelical i am much more interested in his list of questions than in either of their answers
4799329 little rock had a strong mayor and council system from 1830 to 1958 citizens then voted to change to a city manager form 2 0of government it operated like a corporate board of directors where the ceo was hired by an elected city council
4799330 when i decided not to seek re election mark stadola the current mayor was elected he and the city b oard continued discussions and implemented the recommendations we had set forth
4799331 its a traditional system in which the mayor enjoys additional power in essence a chief executive with limited chief executive authority
4799332 the difference is that his powers a s chief executive are governed by the mayor who is responsible for hiring and firing the city manager and city attorney before that it was the city board and council that hired and fired the city manager and attorney
4799333 98 of government in arkansas is a pure council form of government including north little rock
4799334 in most systems there is a mayor that hires his own department heads and does not have to seek approval in the little rock hybrid the city manger does that and does not have to seek approval of the mayor or city council influence can depend a lot on political dynamics
4799335 consider legislation which says depending on how you interpret it that a mayor should be paid no less than the highest city employee if that person gets a pay increase then the mayor should get an increase that is not happening
4799336 the other part of this relates more to bruce moore who was just fired and our national search for a new city manager instead of hiring one at 150 000 lets say we hire one at 260 000 whatever we hire the person at it is the mayor who makes the choice subject to the approval of the city council
4799337 all i am telling you is that the evolution of change is something that has some real interesting interpretations and outcomes that is what little rock is going through a transition to a system that had begun to evolve in the early 90s to a stronger position in which a person is elected directly
4799338 little rock has always maintained the city manager form of government
4799339 tulsa has a pure strong form of city government dallas also has a city manager form of city government although there are multimillion dollar campaigns for mayor there
4799340 there has been an evolution to get away from giving too much power to the city manager without balancing that with some real power for the mayor the public wants to know that who they elect can call the shots therein lays the real conundrum
4799341 i didnt try to abuse the position what i did was make myself available 24 hours a day so that i would there if needed and i worked with the manager to make sure i knew what was happening
4799342 i would say the mayor council system is one of the best forms in todays world because it is very clear who is the boss who is elected and who is held accountable
4799343 ultimately it comes down to the people they make the determination when elections come around
4799344 people in maumelle got upset because they didnt like the way the city manager was doing something in zoning and they held a petition drive when individuals realized that they could not elect or unelect him they decided to turn the thing over and elect someone
4799345 that is that direct accountability and the public saying we want more connection
4799346 it usually results from some board member that felt like they did not get the attention they needed to get something done
4799347 there was no major dissatisfaction in little rock until the late 80s at the time we had a very strong city manger named tom dalton because he had the ability to get his team together and get things done he was a 2 0hot button and that resulted in marches at city hall from labor groups and other special interests
4799348 maumelle is the kind of community that could get divided and ways to preserve the idea that there is benefit to this professional management should be considered
4799349 there are more people that have a masters of public administration and more governments hiring these people to be part of their staff the hybrid flux in this situation lends to accountability a mayor can hire someone smarter than they are to run operations and market that as part of their work
4799350 as mayor one could say when issues arise that the matter will be brought to the attentio n of the city manager accountability then falls on him and it may or may not involve a directive from city council members
4799351 united we stand divided we fall i espoused that the entire time and remained committed to regional thinking we accomplished a lot on a regional basis under that umbrella
4799352 i believe were all in this boat together if it springs a link we better all be bailing that is really what a community is all about
4799353 they may want to toss the manager or mayor but i say toss them at election time not the form of government in general that is not the answer i think it was the answer for little rock but i wish we would have done it differently
4799354 the way we did things however kept people at the table together in an evolving process
4799355 so i will give you an opinio n on anything
4799356 where there is an elected official he seems to be more responsive than an appointed official they need to be accessible or there is a price to pay at election time or perhaps in the grocery store the people see you at that office and they will tell you what they think
4799357 the second observation is that people want government like a business i think there are ways to bring a more business type of model one of the great limits is that business takes a lot of risks
4799358 public officials make homeruns and sometimes they strike i dont think a lot of times the general public is on board with the government taking risks and that keeps the status quo in existence things dont change and agency heads dont want to take big risks
4799359 we accomplished a lot in little rock because people are willing to collaborate although i am not one for praise i like that we have made progress in this city even as we have evolved united we stand

4799380 a lot of religious voters are trying to make up their mind about how theyll vote
4799381 a lot say they have some preference for mccain but a lot of that preference is soft and many are still open the candidates faith and how they connect to issues is important to those voters
4799382 as a pastor i believe in the separation of church and state but i dont believe we can separate religion from politics because ones faith determines ones worldview which informs ones decisions and determines how one would lead
4799383 some secularists think i am going to make this a christian or religious litmus test for the presidency while many religious people assume i am going to wimp out and not ask about issues involving sanctity of life and the family including abortion stem cell research and traditional marriage neither is reflective of my position or purpose in this process
4799384 i will ask all the tough questions but this is a conversation not a confrontation and i am going to be civil in our discussion people know where i stand on the critical issues however this forum is not about me and what i believe but to give a place for america to hear the candidates hearts by going beyond moral issues and their virtues to also share their values and vision for leadership

4799408 600 000 tons of proven thorium oxide reserves various estimates indicate additional probable reserves of as much as 1 8 million tons or more of thorium oxide contained within these claims
4799409 vein deposits of thorite thsio 4 such as those that occur in the area of the lemhi pass present the highest grade thorium mineral and are believed to contain approximately 25 to 63 percent thorium oxide tho 2 per ton of raw ore thus one ton of thorium ore could potentially yield as much as 500 1 200 lbs of high grade thorium oxide tho 2 as compared with less than one percent of raw uranium ore that is typically utilizable the deployment of lemhi pass thorium represents a more economically feasible source of nuclear grade ore than uranium deposits
4799410 the core size is related to factory manufacture of the vessel and transportation to the reactor site which is a favorable factor for diameters up to about 5m at 10m the constructionis likely an expensive eld operation or more elaborate transportation to the site by barge for example
4799411 in the course of development of the msr and during the early deployment of the rst few power plants the size of the vessel will not be a concern but extensive deployment is expected to be highly driven by market pull
4799412 the msr has so many favorable features many discussed here that one is at a loss to explain why the reactor has not already been developed once a program has been killed there is a stigma attached that creates a legacy of its own several decades ago reactor accidents low number of orders for new reactors low uranium prices and low cost natural gas have discouraged reactor development such as the msr but all these things have reversed i strongly recommend independent thinkers to re look at and invest in the msr china and india could take on this task to their great advantage even a philanthropist or venture capitalist could breathe new life into this concept as mall 10mwe or even much smaller test reactor would provide relevant information useful to proceeding on to a commercial power reactor and represents a low risk low cost rst step

4799464 a year ago two years ago one bank said no
4799465 the message from investors to corporates is that if we are headed for a recession they should clean up their balance sheets and prepare a financial buffer
4799466 as banks de lever non financial corporates will have to wake up a to far less flexible world of credit
4799467 the market appears to have overreacted to a fall in the oil price and investors have turned a blind eye to second round effects of inflation such as rising wages

4799470 we see a danger that european banks will have to raise new capital though how bad it will be depends on what happens to us house prices
4799471 we are concerned about their starting level of capital and the low level of mark downs on structured credit
4799472 having successfully obtained 4bn of fresh capital this makes hbos the best capitalized of any major uk bank and one of the best capitalized in europe

4799638 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways

4799640 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful

4799909 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers when 107 countries nations came together to ban the weapon this may they showed the best of what humanity can be russias use of cluster bombs in the face of this international action shows a government at its most inhumane
4799910 the united kingdom took a strong positive stand this year in dublin in may supporting the establishment of a new norm in international humanitarian behavior and outlawing forever the use of cluster bombs

4799933 the disposal of human wastes is a subject normally buried in euphemism and avoidance at least in public privately every single person on the planet is intimately concerned on a day to day even hour to hour basis with the need to relieve themselves in a congenial place and fashion the physiological necessity of excretion cannot be averted even if it cannot be spoken of no one can attain the purity of the perfect saint who manages to digest every single thing he or she consumes a power that certain holy men in the ancient world were believed to possess even the most rigid toilet training can enable a person to postpone their visits to the rest room only for a certain length of time every day each human being emits an average of slightly less than 100 grams of feces and roughly one and a half litres of urine even though this regular process of bodily evacuation may not be thought of as dishonourable and base a phrase from victorian england it is nonetheless regarded as noxious and unmentionable by most of the human race this is an unspoken subject in almost every culture except in the context of ribaldry and scatological humour the organs of defecation are close to or identified with those used for sex another delicate subject the subspecies of engineers who preoccupy themselves with mire are viewed askance as if they were mildly touched and in the uk plumbers earn more than other kinds of household fixers because of bravery in the face of ordure the very word toilet at least upon the anglo saxon tongue has an awkward and embarrassed ring and its use is often regarded as vulgar that there is a worldwide sanitary crisis is indisputable over 40 per cent of people in the developing world still depend on a bucket a bush the banks of a stream a backstreet or some other sheltered place for their several daily emissions

4799947 with the fall in oil and other commodity prices in the past month both the markets and fed officials had started to turn away from inflation risks and focus on growth risks
4799948 the view which we agree with is that with the usual long and variable lags falling commodity prices and rising unemployment will drive down inflation no need for the fed to get its hands dirty when the housing and credit crunch will do the job
4799949 the markets are in such a forgiving mood that both the stock and bond markets rallied on thursday despite what can only be described as an ugly cpi report

4799954 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy
4799955 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4799956 i didnt come here to run the world record because i was the world record holder
4799957 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4799958 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4799959 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4799960 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4799961 in every way qualified to receive the honour and dignity of knighthood
4799962 caused by blood clotting caused by factors related to taking the oral contraceptive pill
4799963 we want the precautions for the pill written on the outside of the pill packaging
4799964 we want youngsters to know how important it is to read the awareness notices
4799965 if we had read the pills directions more carefully maybe we would still have tanya here
4799966 my daughter wasnt a vain person but shed had acne for 13 years and just wanted to clear it up
4799967 she was smart the dux of her school and she was always the person who organised everyone else
4799968 extremely high risk of having a baby that is severely deformed
4799969 the main reason i have come across is that people are either older and want to protect their own assets or they have been through a separation before and they want to make sure they are protected
4799970 people are more savvy these days perhaps they have less expectation that their relationship is going to last forever
4799971 the finance part is the binding part but many people think they might as well work out lifestyle clauses
4799972 it wouldnt surprise me if fidelity or weight was a clause it depends on the personalities involved and the relative positions of those involved
4799973 we just thought it makes good sense that in the event of a separation not that we think its going to happen that what we bought into the relationship is protected
4799974 i was scared because i didnt know what happened to my head i just felt my head bleeding
4799975 i wasnt sure how bad it was i didnt know what was going to happen was i going to live
4799976 its everything that we usually see in a three or four week period packed into about two days
4799977 the bpe is not delaying the privatisation exercise it is a matter of perception rather than reality so far we have fully privatised 180 entities within two and half years with only two reversal so it is a credit on our part what is happening is the sectorial review of policies and without the sectorial review no investors would come in to invest in an enterprise that will not flourish given the hostile operating environment again since the change of government the national assembly through its various committees have been engaging the bpe to verify the processes and see how far we have gone in the privatisation exercise which i think is okay
4799978 it is an enduring exercise privatistion exercise has time lag we cannot continue to privatize for ever we have to allow investors to settle down and do their job so all this while there have been reviews going on and we have been working all along for the past three and half years handling the issue of reforms and drafting bills which has led to the completion of the abuja sheraton hotel
4799979 to show our transparency and our commitment to ensure that all nigerians participate in the exercise we have mapped out to sell these shares through the floors of the nse that are spread in the six geographical areas of the country the sale of the shares in lagos commenced today august 14 2008 abuja will take place on august 21 2008 kano and portharcourt will take place on august 28 2008 and yola onitsha and ilorin will take place on september 4 2008
4799980 if infrastructure facilities are available in the country investors would be attracted to the privatisation exercise and we would not have the issue of people complaining that the exercise is being delayed
4799981 i would like to express my gratitude to president mbeki for his tireless efforts that he has shown in helping the zimbabwean brothers overcome their differences and to take on in the interest of zimbabweans the new challenge that confront their country
4799982 we need to double our efforts to promote good governance and the rule of law for the sake of people of zimbabwe
4799983 i would like to take this opportunity to salute the leaders of zimbabwe and in this way extract the masses of the people from the dire conditions in which they find themselves in
4799984 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve a national healing and reconciliation
4799985 the zimbabweans are waiting for a positive outcome from our deliberations we will do everything in our power to help the zimbabwe parties to strike a deal on peace negotiations
4799986 this whole village was covered with unexploded cluster munitions they were on peoples rooftops hanging from trees even in playgrounds
4799987 weve managed to clean up about half of the known cluster munition strike sites in this village we hope to have the whole village completely cleared by the end of the year
4799988 our goal is to address the worst of the problem by the end of this year i dont want even one more civilian to have to fall victim to these horrible weapons well do everything we can to make the area safe and let people resume their normal lives
4799989 theres been a huge human toll but the economic toll has also been very high most people in south lebanon earn a living from agriculture people cant farm when the land is full of cluster munitions
