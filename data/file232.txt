2320071 although it has strong defenses to these claims deloitte concluded that it was in the best interests of the firm and its clients to settle this matter now rather than face the burden expense and uncertainty of continued litigation
2320072 the combined settlement of over 300 million is impressive just by its size and also by the fact that we were able to accomplish this is just 2 1 2 years of litigation some of these cases can go on for many years

2320075 his price is about 15 million a year for six seasons what about our top pitching prospect chris perez he throws 98 miles per hour he was an impressive closer in the minors
2320076 well how is he going to get experience unless you give it to him you had the chance in 2008 your team had the worst save percentage in the history of the franchise and you kept running isringhausen and franklin out there to fail and you never at any point gave perez a chance and now im supposed to spend 90 million on a closer to make up for your error in judgment
2320077 rookies have to earn respect you just dont hand them the job
2320078 oh but youll hand the job to a couple of veterans who lost game after game after game this makes about as much sense as ballpark village
2320079 i just want to say that this is pretty unusual which is why everybody is on it
2320080 what we have here are three or four incidents that all happened within a couple of weeks of one another that do appear to have some similarities they are obviously completely unacceptable
2320081 there is always someone who wants to act with bad behavior
2320082 there will be a higher uniformed presence at both forest park and delmar
2320083 its a very high concern and priority to metro when we have anyone assaulted on the system thats a high priority issue we cant allow that to occur
2320084 because i looked and there is one son surrounded and theres another son i cant even find and my husband is on the ground my daughter i dont know where she is it was just horrific
2320085 i think they were just out to pound on people
2320086 as far as being any dangerous situation i think it is an aberration
2320087 we get large groups coming to the loop we want people coming to the loop to be gentlemen and gentlewomen

2320089 a chance to clear my head i had confidence because of what i did earlier this season in the majors i figured out the slider and was able to keep my feel for it

2320091 if he keeps calling me in the ninth so be it if not ill pitch the seventh or eighth

2320097 the first case ever to raise this argument to some degree we have already won just by filing it since it will make other corporations think twice before supporting settlements and if we succeed we will set a huge huge precedent

2320119 the democrats meanwhile campaigned for congress in 2006 by promising to increase the size of the military the presidential front runner hillary clinton is the leader of the partys hawkish wing and recently called for a surge of u s troops into afghanistan john edwards the most leftward major presidential contender just delivered a bare knuckled speech in which he castigated the bush administration for not being tough enough with iran to ensure that iran never gets nuclear weapons we need to keep all options on the table edwards warned this is not a country looking to avoid entangling alliances this is not a country renouncing the threat of force this is not a country looking to come home again the iraq syndrome is over before it even had a chance to begin the u s has no material need to reconsider its dominant role in the world the u s military still has no serious rivals even after the strains of iraq the economy is humming along nicely the u s has no cultural need to retrench vietnam sparked a broad cultural revolution a shift in values and a loss of confidence iraq has not had the same effect many americans have lost faith in the bush administration and in this particular venture but there has been no generalized loss of faith in the american system or in american goodness there hasnt even been a broad political shift in favor of the doves the most important war critics are military types like jack murtha chuck hagel and jim webb who hate this particular war but were superhawks in other circumstances
2320120 without a vibrant tradition of resistance passed on to new generations there can be no nurturing of a collective and critical consciousness only professional conscientiousness survives where there is no vital community to hold up precious ethical and religious ideals there can be no coming to moral commitment only personal accomplishment is applauded without a credible sense of political struggle there can be no shouldering of a courageous engagement only cautious adjustment is undertaken if you stop to think in this way about the source of leadership it becomes clear why there is such a lack of quality leadership in black america today this absence is primarily a symptom of black distance from a vibrant tradition of resistance from a vital community bonded to its ethical ideals and from a credible sense of political struggle presently black middle class life is principally a matter of professional conscientiousness personal accomplishment and cautious adjustment
2320121 the workers search for power labor in the gilded age

2320132 i think chase kind of sees himself this year in a position where hell get the maximum number of reps without question its kind of his turn to be a leader and also be a focal point of the offense
2320133 we know that hes going to get double coverage because hes one of the better big 12 tight ends so weve got to use him to our advantage
2320134 in our offense theres so many multiple things you can do
2320135 now i feel that in order to prove myself its more about quality than quantity im taking that approach
2320136 these tens of thousands of people are making their decisions for any number of reasons in terms of trying to develop a hypothesis for those reasons and then trying to put it into a collective mold is just something the county executive is not considering

2320179 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of
2320180 the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
2320181 so if there are those from the scientific community who believe in creationism who can give a view about how the world came into existence then it cant be set aside you cant have one very narrow theory
2320182 this is not about removing anything from the classroom although that would probably be the ideal for me but this is about us having equality of access to other views as to how the world came into existence and that i think is a very very important issue for many parents in northern ireland
2320183 i have no objection to all kinds of daft ideas being taught in comparative religion classes but in science what we should teach is what there is evidence for and children should be encouraged to examine evidence
2320184 if this politician mr storey wants to import creationism into science classes im wondering which kind of creationism hindu creationism jewish creationism babylonian creationism aztec creationism
2320185 my guess is that it is probably genesis creationism and theres absolutely no reason for it
2320186 we live in a democracy and anyone can get elected
2320187 i think its sad that people with ridiculous views do get elected because it suggests that the electorate is not sufficiently well educated to see through them
2320188 i would hope that a flat earther would not be elected and would not be serving as an important official in educational circles exactly the same would be true of at least a young earth creationist
2320189 it concerns me as a scientist and i think that you would find that it would concern any churchman of any education either a bishop of the roman catholic church of a bishop of the anglican church
2320190 i would be very concerned about scientific falsehoods being purveyed in the name of religion
2320191 im quite happy to take criticism from mr dawkins and be castigated by him
2320192 evolution is a theory it is not a proven fact and we are quite happy to allow our views to be subject to scientific scrutiny just the same as his views are subject to scientific scrutiny

2320206 kugelsternhaufen von sternen oder galaxien zu unterscheiden ist von der erde aus sehr schwierig
2320207 dank hubble konnten wir etwa 90 prozent der kugelsternhaufen in den beobachteten bereichen beobachten das ist wichtig f r die untersuchung von zwerggalaxien die nur wenige kugelsternhaufen aufweisen
2320208 unsere untersuchung hat ergeben dass in regionen mit verschiedenen umweltbedingungen kugelsternhaufen auch mit unterschiedlicher effektivit t entstehen
2320209 zwerggalaxien in der n he des zentrums des virgohaufens enthalten mehr kugelsternhaufen als zwerggalaxien in gr erer entfernung
2320210 in einem umkreis von 130 000 lichtjahren um messier 87 haben wir gar keine oder nur wenige kugelsternhaufen in den galaxien entdeckt
2320211 das deutet darauf hin dass die gro e galaxie den kleineren ihre sternhaufen stiehlt
2320212 in messier 87 finden sich dreimal mehr kugelsternhaufen mit wenig schweren elemente wie eisen als kugelsternhaufen die reich an diesen elementen sind das ist ein hinweis darauf dass viele dieser metall armen sternhaufen von nahen zwerggalaxien gestohlen wurden deren kugelsternhaufen auch ber wenig schwere elemente verf gen
2320213 sternentstehung im zentrum des virgohaufens ist u erst intensiv hier entstehen in kurzer zeit auf relativ kleinem raum sehr viele sterne
2320214 sie d rfte daher schneller und effektiver sein als in den au enbereichen die hohe sternentstehungsrate k nnte sich durch den gravitativen kollaps von dunkler materie erkl ren lassen die im haufenzentrum in gr erer konzentration vorkommt

2320223 i havent seen anything to start with that anybody could have made those spores in the area where the bacteriology division in building 1425 worked
2320224 but only a very small portion of it has been selected to characterize him
2320225 just because he might have been able to dry some anthrax doesnt mean he could produce the extraordinary quality of the spores that the fbi has said they found its simply not possible for a lone mad scientist to do it in that lab

2320231 a major initiative of the mu and now we have to nurture it and go further everyone will have to make an effort as the europeans did to put an end to the deadly spiral of war and violence that century after century repeatedly brought barbarity to the heart of civilisation

2320234 if we dont start making some money well cut some more
2320235 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
2320236 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief
2320237 this study adds to a growing body of evidence that indicates that cannabis is effective in the short term at least in the management of neuropathic pain
2320238 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries

2320244 it is important that we work to ensure that as many voters as possible have the opportunity to participate in a conversation about the challenges facing western new york and the country and the solutions we offer
2320245 these will be great opportunities for us to communicate with voters however these forums will not provide most district voters with the opportunity to directly ask questions of the candidates

2320248 there is nothing inherently argumentative or prejudicial about transitive verbs and the court is not willing to fashion a rule that would require the attorney general to engage in useless nominalization
2320249 theres no disputing what this measure does first and foremost what it does is eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry in the state of california
2320250 we believe the attorney general has attempted to influence voters against this measure
2320251 it is our goal to ensure that voters have a fair opportunity to decide this measure for themselves on election day
2320252 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party

2320322 companies are now looking to contain their eroding margins as against passing on the benefit of the excise duty waiver from the uttarakhand plants

2320324 given the economic situation right now it is natural that consumers have deferred their purchase or upgrade time
2320325 many people have deferred their decision to upgrade to premium products
2320326 the sentiment to upgrade exists but the current economic conditions have led to a delay in purchases
2320327 many second time buyers who wish to upgrade come and inquire about the discount or finance schemes available but since neither option is available they choose not to buy
2320328 the sale of high end products has suffered the most in this situation
2320329 fewer financing options will have a definite bearing on sales

2320337 these downloads are clearly being used as malware conduits but all it takes is for one company staffer to be taken in by the forged email alerts and a companys security can be totally undone
2320338 the issue the anti virus and malware security industry faces with these types of downloads is that the hackers are using code obfuscation techniques to hide what the program code actually does
2320339 coupled with shape shifting technology that changes the pattern of the program each time it is downloaded this makes it difficult if not impossible for regular it security software to spot the code as it reaches the desktop pc
2320340 the industry needs to stay one step ahead of the hackers in this regard and respond with new approaches when dealing with developing trends like this one

2320391 interestingly the effect of infection is different between men and women dr boulter writes in the latest issue of
2320392 infected men have lower iqs achieve a lower level of education and have shorter attention spans they are also more likely to break rules and take risks be more independent more anti social suspicious jealous and morose and are deemed less attractive to women
2320393 on the other hand infected women tend to be more outgoing friendly more promiscuous and are considered more attractive to men compared with non infected controls

2320401 i am at such a stage of my career that success and failure dont matter to me anymore today it is more about living up to my own expectations i have now become very selfish and greedy where it comes to work i want to surprise and shock my fans and even myself by doing unusual things
2320402 you can see there is a lot of competition around for me nowadays i love working with younger heroes but i am also scared of them they are all so fit i have to match up to them if i have to work along with them for that my coach says i need to be fit and fine
2320403 one of the reasons i want to be president is for the benefits i saw all the vacation days bully boy got and i figured i deserved them too id like some sick days too but im not going to choke on a pretzel just to get them its good to be president
2320404 this mean my case will never be heard by the supreme court and my quest for justice failed and i will never be vindicated legally although i have come to accept this and knew of the possibility it has been disheartening i dont need outside sources to validate me i know who i am and i know what is in my heart
2320405 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2320406 you got two choices you stay home and not vote or if you want your vote to mean something and you want to be with the winner you vote for one of the two major party candidates otherwise you are wasting your vote
2320407 were those voters in the 19th century who spun off from the whigs and the democrats and didnt try to spin the difference between these two parties on slavery waste their vote
2320408 ive done surveys and polls all over the country heres my conclusion 15 of the republicans will vote for the republican nominee if the republican nominee was leon trotsky and 15 of the democrats would vote for the democratic nominee if the nominee was ayn rand
2320409 they didnt roll back any of president bushs legislation when they took over in 2007

2320413 nader accuses the news media of being in a cultural rut by ignoring him he said hed been on national television only 10 seconds this election cycle put me in all the debates and well have a three way race
2320414 the media is in a cultural rut i am not talking about their private incisive skeptical conversations with one another i am talking about the questions they dont ask the questions they ask give me a bunch of 10 year olds instead of the white house press corps and the president would be far far more upset and anxious dont be so cynical about small starts if nature was like you seeds would never have a chance to sprout
2320415 in the picture there are bushes where theres in fact a two storey house
2320416 i think it has diminished since we raised it a few years back
2320417 theyll paint the nature strip a nice green instead of brown brush over power lines
2320418 its sort of par for the course that theres a degree of exaggeration

2320454 once the three men were in the water there was very little chance they could get back on the boat as it was blown before a 15 knot wind and they struggled in lumpy seas
2320455 from that point the end would have been swift none of them was a good swimmer the seas were choppy the men would quickly have become exhausted and sunk beneath the waves

2320486 the company delivered industry leading same store results in a very challenging economic environment the majority of our revenue declines continue to come from classified advertising local advertising revenue is holding up quite well and our online and circulation revenues continue to grow
2320487 we are experiencing increasing inflationary pressure particularly with regard to newsprint pricing delivery costs and health care expenses unfortunately these expense increases offset our targeted cost reductions in the second quarter resulting in a 1 3 decline in expenses year over year on a same store basis less than we anticipated we continue to aggressively look for ways to reduce expenses without impacting the quality of news and customer service we provide to our readers and advertisers we also continue to invest in and expand our online business which is translating into growth both protecting and enhancing our local franchises print and online is very important to our future
2320488 given the challenging environment we are using free cash flow to reduce leverage and maintain additional liquidity these initiatives will also allow us to pay down our revolving credit facility to zero over the next three months when the revolving credit facility is at zero we have no leverage covenant tests under our credit facility our facility does not mature until 2014 which provides us with significant time to strengthen our balance sheet
2320489 when you have palestinians being forced to flee by other palestinians it is a tragedy
2320490 this is the behaviour of a brutal dictatorship not a political party working in the interests of its people
2320491 it is beyond doubt that there are now two separate palestinian territories so who does israel deal with mahmoud abbas does not speak for palestinians in gaza and hamas is not interested in any negotiations with israel at all this civil war makes a permanent solution impossible to negotiate
2320492 it is certainly true that not all muslims are terrorists
2320493 however the majority of terrorists in the world are muslims
2320494 osama bin laden is a muslim and most of those who carried out suicide attacks against buses schools houses buildings all over the world in the past 10 years also were muslims what a terrible record doesnt that say something to us about ourselves our societies and our culture
2320495 what do they call it multi culti its all absurd you know
2320496 if ignorance and poverty are responsible for the growth of extremist views in the islamic world someone needs to ask muslim students privileged enough and bright enough to attend some of the united kingdoms best universities why one in three of them endorses killing in the name of islam

2320533 thats why lenders government and the advice sector are working closely together to minimise the impact on borrowers
2320534 they politicians keep finding ways to attack the industry and that will drive innovation out of new york city and to london tokyo and elsewhere
2320535 i wasnt ready for the first match i was so intimidated by the fargodome thats the first time i wrestled in a facility that big i didnt feel comfortable until after my first match
2320536 i choked that loss was so huge because santoro went on to become an all american by placing sixth
2320537 it was even more painful when i saw that two wrestlers i beat in the pennsylvania amateur wrestling federation state tournament became all americans
2320538 i beat john laboranti during the state tournament and he placed seventh at 171 i beat john staudenmayer in the state finals and he moved down to 160 and placed fifth
2320539 i turned down the invitation because i didnt want to miss too much football practice
2320540 i was already missing more than a week with my trip to fargo n d i would have known what to expect if i could have wrestled in the national duals i probably would have faced some of the kids i wrestled at fargo
2320541 i lost 6 2 to don smith in the first round
2320542 i was very happy with my performance in the wpial tournament but should have done better in the state tournament
2320543 my goal for the upcoming season is to repeat as wpial champion and place high in the piaa tournament
2320544 this year i should be starting at linebacker and should see a lot of playing time in the backfield at fullback
2320545 we dont have many starters back but should have a solid team
2320546 we should be much better than people are giving us credit for
2320547 torian has the strongest and quickest release of any outfielder ive had in 13 years of coaching
2320548 hes made tremendous throws of more than 300 feet to gun down runners
2320549 cyrus has a cannon for an arm and great speed
2320550 i made it to altoona last year but didnt get picked for the west team
2320551 it was so disappointing it was a big relief to make it this year its been one of my goals to play in this game ill finally get that chance this weekend
2320552 in our first playoff game against new brighton torian tracked down a ball in the left center gap and threw a strike on one hop to home plate to get a runner trying to score
2320553 the next night a new brighton runner tried to tag from third and torian threw 265 feet on a dead line to gun him down i was surprised they tried to run on him two nights in a row
2320554 torians most impressive throw came last season he threw out a runner trying to tag from second to third he threw a strike from the center field warning track his release is so quick that runners dont have a chance
2320555 he walked 10 times in five games he had only 11 official at bats they felt it was safer to walk him
2320556 torian can hit for power can hit for contact and can also bunt for hits
2320557 and he runs a 6 8 seconds in the 60 yard dash he can run down almost anything in the outfield and is also dangerous on the bases hes got the tools and the work ethic to possibly play in the minors well just have to wait and see how he does in college
2320558 potomac state has one of the most successful programs on the east coast
2320559 a lot of players select junior colleges because of the one on one instruction they get
2320560 everybody ive talked to has told me that potomac state has a great baseball program
2320561 they are also strong academically i want to major in sports management
2320562 i played shortstop and sometimes second base until my freshman year
2320563 coach mineard felt i would be more effective in the outfield i was bummed at first but now i kind of like playing in the outfield
2320564 its a fun game but it gets a bad rap
2320565 theres an awful lot of just good folks playing this game
2320566 a lot of my friends and family havent had the chance to see me pitch professionally
2320567 im definitely looking forward to getting appearances in washington and giving them the chance to watch me play
2320568 it was one of those things where i definitely saw it coming
2320569 the fact they kept me down in extended spring training rather than sending me up i knew i was at the low end of the organizations plans
2320570 i just didnt have the opportunities to pitch at williamsport i made three appearances in four weeks it became a situation where i was ready to start over i wouldnt say it was a sense of relief but im glad it happened sooner rather than later
2320571 i was a starter in college but was moved to the bullpen during my first year in professional baseball it took me a little while to make the adjustment after i was able do it and get comfortable i definitely gained confidence and saw i could pitch at that level
2320572 the first couple of games were no different from playing in affiliated ball
2320573 i was put in the same situations that i had been in the past coming out of the bullpen
2320574 i came into both my first two games just to face one batter and my job was to get the guy out and give my team a chance to get a couple of runs fortunately my second time out they were able to do that
2320575 i look forward to the opportunity to come in and show the guys what i have
2320576 the main thing all the guys who sign with the frontier league want to do is get picked up by a major league affiliated team but i cant worry about that
2320577 i hope to go out there and perform my best every outing thats all that matters
2320578 hes very straight he just has all the shots hes a tremendous golfer
2320579 i think i was 10 years old when i started playing and the first tournament i played in was the father son tournament at churchill
2320580 my father had to play with both david and i on the same day it was a long day for him but it was a lot of fun for us
2320581 through my final year of college and after i finally graduated i played in four or five things around the country and played pretty well but i didnt think i was long enough or good enough to make it a career
2320582 i just think i have been doing it so long its second nature
2320583 im not the longest player but im not very crooked
2320584 hes a plus four handicap that means he owes the course four strokes every time he plays
2320585 and so with so many women having an aversion to watching the middle aged panellists jawing over some trivial news story

2320607 the cox report the unanimous and bipartisan report of the house select committee on u s national security and military commercial concerns with the people s republic of china

2320615 this has the potential to play as the hardest major
2320616 and thats never the case usually of the four majors if you played your best you could score here now you could play great and 70 might be awesome
2320617 i had a feeling with st johns having that week off they might have been a little lackadaisical
2320618 chris was just great about 80 percent of his pitches were strikes and pitching when it is an 0 1 count and not 1 0 is a big difference there were a lot of fabulous plays behind him too
2320619 i went up to the guy keeping my pitch count and i asked him how many pitches i threw
2320620 i figured i could go back out there and overall my arm has been holding up great
2320621 our season just went very well for only being in our second year in the league i am very proud of everyone on this team
2320622 i know we had a couple arms pitching wise and that made a big difference everyone just came together and played as a team we really needed that team chemistry
2320623 i am very proud of the way rosselot built himself up throughout the season and how he was going after hitters we had a lot of good arms but i would still like to look into getting a few more arms for next season

2320628 weve come from behind before not only in the finals but in the early rounds too
2320629 thats part of our experience we dont let that get us down and we are veteran enough to know that if we go down in a game we know why we went down in that game and what we need to do to overcome that
2320630 i wasnt really happy seeing him on the mound with us being down 1 0 already
2320631 he is so consistent with all his pitches and thats one of the reasons he goes with us to tournaments
2320632 we knew he was going out there on short rest and our approach was to make him throw a lot of pitches
2320633 you hate to say that we overlooked our regular season but we just wanted to make sure everything would be ready to go down there
2320634 what can i getya babycakes prawns and scrambled eggs hon no problem babe ill get a rush on that for you
2320635 having a penis doesnt make you omniscient you fucking tool
2320636 i know you have answered a few questions already that are similar my house is on pier and beams i going to insulate under my house this spring i have asked a few people what i should use and they have pretty much said the same thing you have suggested but my question is could i use an insulated panel with a foil backing and use the dead air between the panels and the floor as my insulation or would i be better off the other way with no vapor barrier insulation r19 and a vapor barrier to hold it up
2320637 pros and cons of using faced or unfaced batts in between the floor joist of my soon to be sheetrocked garage apartment ceiling of garage will be rocked apt is heated and cooled garage is not williamsburg virginia what about low crawls is it not better for the moisture to go up into the home through the floor than stuck by the wood joists
2320638 i have a 16 x 20 room that is covered by a flat roof this room stays about 5 degrees warmer than the rest of the house it has a drop ceiling which i could easily remove for access to install insulation what type of insulation would be best to install between a drop ceiling and flat roof

2320640 i think were getting into better territory ive been very much focused on the fall in oil prices as a necessary ingredient to avoid recession to the extent that were getting that thats just great
2320641 what we need in this market is for the financial stocks to stabilize i think theyll stabilize well before the housing market fixes itself
2320642 this commodity pullback is very timely because i think it does take that stress point away from the market
2320643 four years in the marine corps as a gunner and i made it and im alive
2320644 this is actually what ive been looking for for many many years
2320645 i need somebody to hold my hand and point me in the right direction
2320646 a traditional 8 to 5 job may not work if you have to make periodic visits for ambulatory care or psychological issues
2320647 if somebody cannot hear well you need to have signing if someone is blind you need to have braille
2320648 the big issue we have with veterans is the post traumatic stress and the psychological issues of returning to society and trying to be independent
2320649 so if a guy liked you would you want him to ask you on a date or just ask to hang out
2320650 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries across the oceans across the mountains across the prairies because we are made of sugar candy
2320651 the basic outline of the government we possess and our civic religion as a people is such that potentially at least we could create a society that is a model for the world it isnt right now
2320652 the truth is in order to get things like universal health care and a revamped education system then someone is going to have to give up a piece of their pie so that someone else can have more
2320653 violence begets violence hatred begets hatred and terrorism begets terrorism a white ambassador said that yall not a black militant not a reverend who preaches about racism an ambassador whose eyes are wide open and who is trying to get us to wake up and move away from this dangerous precipice upon which we are now poised the ambassador said the people that we have wounded dont have the military capability we have but they do have individuals who are willing to die and take thousands with them and we need to come to grips with that
2320654 because sometimes its easier to hold on to your own stereotypes and misconceptions it makes you feel justified in your own ignorance thats america
2320655 the government lied about pearl harbor too they knew the japanese were going to attack governments lie the government lied about the gulf of tonkin they wanted that resolution to get us in the vietnam war governments lie the government lied about nelson mandela and our cia helped put him in prison and keep him there for 27 years the south african government lied on nelson mandela governments lie
2320656 we have become a nation of struggling folks who are barely making it every day
2320657 folks are just jammed up and its gotten worse over my
2320658 the basic outline of the government we possess and our civic religion as a people is such that potentially at least we could create a society that is a model for the world it isnt right now
2320659 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries across the oceans across the mountains across the prairies because we are made of sugar candy
2320660 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2320661 one hundred and fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles have entered south ossetia
2320662 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2320663 we cannot allow the deaths of our countrymen to go unpunished the guilty parties will receive the punishment they deserve

2320677 i have just started using chimera 0 4 on os 10 1 5 so far it is great a very nice clean quick interface that is also intuitive which are all the pluses that we as mac users are looking for in every app that we use importing bookmarks was quick and simple once i could find them on the new os x file heirarchy to tell the truth this browser is amazing for a sub 1 0 release some nifty features multiple web sites in the same window using a tab set up and automatically detecting ad pop ups and eliminating them no it does not have all the features packed into explorer and netscape but with the advent of apple creating web apps right into os x like mail and the upcoming ichat i want my browser to be as simple as possible chimera fits the bill perfectly for now it will be my primary browser
2320678 i discovered chimera through checking mozilla from a macaddict magazine and gave it a try it is truly an amazing and simple mac os browser i am using version 0 5 now and eagerly looking forward to updates pages load quickly and i have even removed the internet explorer alias from my dock and primarily use chimera now this program does os x justice
2320679 in my opinion camino is without a doubt and hands down the best browser to date

2320684 candy cap mushroom is sweet enough to perfume even the mustiest dorm room the skin of a rough skinned newt holds enough toxin to kill a mouse licking a slug leaves you with a slimy numb tongue
2320685 who will speak for the trees natural history professor steve gliessman asks in his forward
2320686 and hopefully there are those who are willing to listen
2320687 how in gods name can you make a blt worth 7
2320688 let me come in and show you some of the latest things weve added to our program in the last couple of months
2320689 do you know anyone in the neighborhood i can talk to about my videos
2320690 the person who gave you my name probably gave you the same names that i would tell you
2320691 dude magic mtn is 25 bucks with a coupon you cant come up with 25 bucks
2320692 sonny people who use the church network as nothing more than a list of sales contacts ought to be excommunicated except for real estate agents and life insurance agents and maybe multi level marketing schemes although thats a close one
2320693 thats the guy that came up to us when we were playing and asked where the mormons in the neighborhood lived
2320694 they gave me the power to review every video book and workbook they had produced any lds doctrine that i found present would be taken out videos redone reissued and all the booklets etc with such material scrapped
2320695 youre locked in as long as we can lock you in or you only got 90 days to view a video and replace it if its defective
2320696 you can have the gummy bears and pretzels or the peanut brittle and jelly beans what will it be
2320697 i hope everyone of you bashing living scriptures has never boughten anything from deseret book or seagull book or any other church book store cuz that is exactly what they are doing making money off quality products
2320698 if you cant sell living scriptures you will never succeed on a mission
2320699 it is okay to get into debt for a home education or
2320700 poor mormons to sign the longterm contract without letting them know that they cant get out of it without large financial penalties or by having their credit ruined
2320701 dvds may be purchased in smaller sets with fewer free dvds call for information
2320702 i am pleased to report that fen has enthusiatically implemented my recommendations and the products now stand clean of any mormon or other not orthodox influence as such i endorce them as products of the highest quality and i confidently recommend them to christian families and churches
2320703 i know i probably sound like im bearing my testimony but i just think they are so great
2320704 well you know that we arent supposed to use the ward directory but well do it anyways and just lie mwah ha ha ha hah
2320705 fine brenda lsi is so wonderful that we are now recommending that everyone go take out a second mortgage on their house and buy a set for themselves just please please please leave us alone
2320706 besides this talk of how expensive these cartoons are to make is a bunch of smoke the reason for the extended contracts is to maximize profits period i dont believe for a second that the company would go under without bilking people and too often tricking them into long commitments they cant get out of my strong suspicion is that the only thing that would happen is that company profits might drop a little and even that is debatable these retarded defenses that people show up here and make could hardly be more annoying to me to me the whole company reeks of the same stank a multi level marketing company gives off
2320707 sorry we cant sell one at a time because bs bs and bs
2320708 but i love my children so i cant afford not to make this investment of thousands of dollars in their spiritual future
2320709 you cant cancel once you sign the contract or well send your butts to collections and kill your credit
2320710 hey this is a mormon product and if i dont want to make good on my end of the agreement then they should just let me out of this contract this is church stuff for petes sack
2320711 any communication with the intent to decieve is a lie
2320712 he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her
2320713 you probably read that blog that is on the internet
2320714 whos the relief society president whos got the most rowdy kids etc
2320715 i just had to write and tell you about a decision we got this morning this is a really great ruling rejecting the latest scheme to keep lgbt high school kids closeted and scared
2320716 promote tolerance and equality among students regardless of sexual orientation and or gender identities
2320717 but if your goal is to make the democratic party better on lgbt issues then your money should go to supportive state parties and independent lgbt groups like the stonewall democrats
2320718 this is a conversation the lgbt community needs to have and hasnt yet
2320719 lgbt finance staff and key fundraisers did sit at the caucus table as before but what is different is that lately we seem to be treated solely as an atm for the party with our civil rights seeming an afterthought or burden
2320720 given the meeting its obvious that we continue to be invited to the table pay for the meal but we are not allowed to eat
2320721 the dnc has worked hard ever since i have been soliciting funds to elect candidates who in almost every instance were far better on lgbt issues than their opponents
2320722 of the 107 senators and congressfolk with perfect 100 ratings from the human rights campaign in this past congress 103 were democrats and only four were republicans of the 156 who rated zero 152 were republicans the difference could hardly be more stark
2320723 i assume you are asking a similar set of questions of the republican national committees gay leaders and staff
2320724 a little dnc money was diverted in 2006 specifically to fight the anti marriage amendments but only a little i dont know the exact amount
2320725 so it makes sense for someone like me to give his federal dollars to the dnc expecting them to be used mainly for federal purposes while giving non federal dollars to non federal groups to fight the anti marriage initiatives
2320726 was able to do more in some states than others
2320727 i dont think the same can be said of efforts at the rnc
2320728 it finds cross cutting issues among different democratic constituency groups and works on them
2320729 faith based voters who agree with us if they hear our message
2320730 and you can see what happens to anyone who does
2320731 as everyone knows i have never been a traditional city manager and have learned to confront my fears last week i was training with the fire departments technical rescue team and rappelled down a very small rope 300 feet to the ground as i walked away a spectator told me i was crazy to do such a thing but admitted i showed a lot of courage however i tried to explain that this exercise did not depend on courage but an absolute trust in the team that supported me it is with this same sense of trust in the community and my largo family that i now begin a new journey in my life
2320732 i need to emphasize that this is a deeply personal and difficult decision on his part and one that will have my understanding compassion and support what matters most to me is my bosss skills knowledge and abilities and not my bosss gender i hope that you can provide him the same support as mr stanton has every desire to continue his work with the city of largo
2320733 this is an important moment for the city of largo are we going to be small minded and intolerant or progressive innovative and passionate
2320734 his brain is the same today as it was last week he may be even able to be a better city manager
2320735 but i sense that hes lost his standing as a leader among the employees of the city
2320736 hes not going to be a man and hes not going to be a female hes going to be an it
2320737 if jesus was here tonight i can guarantee you hed want him terminated
2320738 steve stantons firing is discrimination plain and simple it stems from a willingness to dehumanize transgender people in such a way that to makes firing routine discrimination rampant and violence frighteningly common the hatred expressed by the mob the fury that surrounded his dismissal that night by those who justified themselves by invoking god is a frightening and public example of what happens to lgbt people all the time but rarely with such visibility largo is a wake up call to those who believe quietly in equality in your silence the mob speaks for you and takes your absence as license to systemically ignore the civil and human rights of lgbt people
2320739 smith didn t have permission to pass out fliers as required by city law
2320740 it shall be unlawful to distribute to pedestrians upon any street park or other public place in the city or to distribute to passengers in any bus or to throw into or upon any bus or automobile or other vehicle any handbill dodger or advertising notice of a commercial character
2320741 we often talk about the connection between hateful speech and hate motivated violence
2320742 i think it is neat we are here in this room and heard some very divergent opinions yet no one is taking up arms and our police officers are not hauling people out of the room
2320743 its just real painful to know that seven days ago i was a good guy and now i have no integrity i have no trust and most painful i have no followers
2320744 in so many ways i am largo it would be like suing my mother
2320745 many residents have called and expressed outrage they have asked how they can help reverse the damage done that night to their community steve stanton deserves to be judged by his job performance and the real largo deserves a chance to repair the image the nation now holds
2320746 im realistic enough to know its going to require an extraordinary step to stop the train going down the track with a certain degree of speed and to confront some of the folks back in the commission chambers who will be talking about what jesus would do
2320747 first i would like to thank everyone who called and emailed me the past week you reaching out and supporting me through this time is wonderful and inspiring it is amazing how so many of you some i have not heard from for years took the time to see how i am i am fine and would like to remind everyone that we still have much work to do it is up to each of us everyday in our communities to stand up and speak up so that the toxic atmosphere of hatred and bigotry does not make invisible the fair minded compassionate majority who care about advancing civil rights for all people
2320748 and though i have all faith so that i could move mountains but have not love i am nothing
2320749 but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace
2320750 race color religion sex national origin disability age or marital status there is no statewide non discrimination law that includes protections based on neither sexual orientation nor gender identity
2320751 youre not going to get a very sympathetic ear from the insurer
2320752 cor blimey guvna ow dare ya speak of manchester in my pub chelsea for life
2320753 this has been the most amazing thing of my life
2320754 its opened me up to all the different styles and what kind of dancer i want to be i cant thank everyone enough
2320755 all along the way from san jose to l a and on the way back again
2320756 im not a huge dance fan i dont go to the ballet or anything
2320757 so steven if you could offer one piece of consumer advice what would it be
2320758 eh if youre really hungry and you havent had it in a while and youve got very little time to get what you really want for lunch then ok
2320759 wah wah wah its super yuppified and not authentic whine whine bitch bitch moan moan

2320761 la superioridad a rea sobre jap n podr a haber ejercido la suficiente presi n como para llevar a una rendici n incondicional y hacer innecesaria la invasi n bas ndose en una detallada investigaci n de los hechos y apoyados en el testimonio de los l deres japoneses supervivientes es la opini n de esta comisi n que jap n se habr a rendido incluso si las bombas at micas no hubieran sido arrojadas incluso si rusia no hubiera entrado en guerra e incluso si no se hubiera planeado o contemplado la invasi n
2320762 la capitulaci n incluso si los t rminos fueran duros
2320763 no se hizo ning n esfuerzo y ninguno de los que se hicieron fue seriamente considerado para conseguir la rendici n y no se hizo para no tener que no emplear la bomba
2320764 por intimidar a los rusos con la bomba haci ndola explotar m s que pase ndose con ella bajo el brazo
2320765 nunca hubo por mi parte ninguna ilusi n que me apartara de la idea de que rusia era nuestro enemigo y que el proyecto estaba siendo desarrollado sobre ese punto de partida
2320766 una pantalla legal y moral farisaica de im genes positivas de valores occidentales e inocencia y nos hacemos los amenazados dando validez a una campa a de violencia ilimitada
2320767 nunca ha dado mi apoyo a la expulsi n forzada de todos los palestinos he dicho en repetidas ocasiones que la expulsi n de los palestinos es inmoral e impracticable
2320768 en determinadas circunstancias la expulsi n no constituye un crimen de guerra no creo que las expulsiones de 1948 de casi un mill n de palestinos fuesen cr menes de guerra no es posible hacer una tortilla sin cascar alg n huevo has de ensuciarte las manos adem s cuando el primer ministro israel ben guri n se puso a la tarea de la expulsi n quiz s deber a haberla completado s que esta afirmaci n resulta demoledora para los rabes los progresistas y los pol ticamente correctos pero considero que este lugar ser a mucho m s tranquilo y conocer a menos sufrimiento si el asunto se hubiese resuelto de una vez por todas si ben guri n hubiera realizado una expulsi n de m s envergadura y hubiera limpiado todo el pa s todo el territorio de israel hasta el r o jord n quiz s resulte que este haya sido su error fatal si hubiese realizado una expulsi n completa y no una parcial habr a estabilizado el estado de israel por generaciones
2320769 me es completamente ajena la idea de que el sionismo haya tenido alguna vez por objetivo el dominio de oriente pr ximo el sionismo pretend a nicamente establecer y mantener un min sculo estado jud o en la tierra de israel palestina patrimonio de los jud os y conquistada por salvajes invasores musulmanes rabes
2320770 israel ha sido amenazado de destrucci n por ir n y el proyecto nuclear iran parece tener por objetivo a israel
2320771 la desaparici n de israel de las p ginas de la historia

2320774 b rbaros que nos quieren quitar la vida en estos momentos esa sociedad se ha convertido en un asesino en serie es una sociedad muy enferma y deber amos tratarla del mismo modo que se trata a los individuos convertidos en asesinos en serie
2320775 todos los servicios secretos del mundo estiman que el programa iran est orientado a la elaboraci n de armas y no a la aplicaci n pac fica de la energ a nuclear
2320776 todos sabemos que estas medidas las sanciones econ micas hasta ahora no han conducido a ninguna parte y son de dif cil aplicaci n
2320777 nunca ha estado a favor de un ataque genocida contra ir n con el objetivo de matar a 70 millones de iran es
2320778 los l deres de ir n har an bien en reflexionar sobre su jueguecito y suspender su programa nuclear su segunda mejor opci n ser a que israel mediante un ataque a reo convencional destruyese sus instalaciones nucleares es evidente que esta acci n supondr a miles de bajas iran es y una humillaci n internacional pero la alternativa es un ir n convertido en un desierto nuclear

2320790 with pat winning and joe sweeny for the west of ireland coming in a close second the emerald isle really did come up top trumps when the results were finalised
2320791 however one way that pat stands out is how he has focused on expanding his franchise through the acquisition of a neighbouring card connection territory
2320792 the continued success of card connection as one of the leading greeting card suppliers in the uk is a testament to all the hard work and dedication that all our franchisees put in on a daily basis we are pleased to be able to recognise their achievements in this way as we certainly couldnt do it without them
2320793 we have residents that have lived in atherton more than 40 years along the tracks
2320794 a lot of the concern is that the authoritys board wasnt given accurate information about the relative impacts of the two alignments
2320795 the staff of the high speed rail authority i dont know if id say they cooked the books but they tilted things very strongly to make it look like the peninsula alignment had a lot less impact than it does
2320796 this is the standard supervised release agreement i went over this with the defendant
2320797 he asked to sleep on it for a night he doesnt want to be supervised

2320800 were passionate about this case we believe the animals were subjected to needless suffering
2320801 for all we know the citizen complaint was rank hearsay and not based on personal knowledge
2320802 because that was the source of our complaint we didnt have probable cause either

2320819 israel ha negado el paso a m s enfermos palestinos en busca de tratamiento desde que hamas se hizo con el control de la franja y varios mueren innecesariamente cada mes
2320820 a pesar del acuerdo entre israel y hamas en vigor desde el 21 de junio de 2008 no ha habido mejoras en la pol tica israel hacia los pacientes de gaza la cual incluso parece haber empeorado a los impedimentos que impone el servicio general de seguridad a las personas que quieren salir de gaza para recibir tratamiento m dico los pacientes se enfrentan a mayores dificultades burocr ticas impuestas por el ej rcito lo que les impide disfrutar de su derecho a la salud
2320821 he invitado a solana y a blair para que vengan a gaza y conozcan personalmente la situaci n de los refugiados pero han desestimado la invitaci n
2320822 el problema es un asunto de justicia no de distribuci n de paquetes de comida y medicinas a gente necesitada al no haber un sistema mediante el cual israel responda de sus acciones no existe la justicia

2320826 perd a mi hijo y mi hija est ahora minusv lida a causa de las minas que hab a cerca de nuestra granja
2320827 nunca sabemos por donde pisar y hemos pedido muchas veces al gobierno que limpie la zona pero todo ha sido en vano tengo que perder un hijo para que alguien nos haga caso
2320828 las minas est n por todas partes todos los a os o mos que van a quitarlas pero nunca hacen nada
2320829 lo nico que nos ofrecen son promesas sin hechos y mientras tanto vamos perdiendo a nuestros ni os como consecuencia de una guerra injusta que no acaba nunca
2320830 toda la atenci n se ha centrado en la situaci n de la seguridad del pa s dejando olvidado el tema de la limpieza de minas a pesar de que tiene la misma importancia
2320831 se destinan millones de fondos a la seguridad en cambio la limpieza de minas recibe escasa atenci n
2320832 los habitantes de las zonas rurales son m s vulnerables ante el peligro de las minas terrestres especialmente porque son en su mayor a analfabetos

2320842 rodger mcfarlane eric sawyer jim eigo peter staley troy masters mark harrington david webster jeremy waldron and hannah arendt contributed to the following remarks
2320843 gina kolata of the new york times is the worst aids reporter in america
2320844 act up put medicine back in the hands of the patients which is where it belongs
2320845 the emasculation of men in minority groups is an ancient trope of the vilest bigotry
2320846 put on your marching shoes go do some politics change this country
2320847 a full generation after aids emerged as a recognizable disease having sex still poses the same risk for hiv infection or reinfection
2320848 in the age of the internet we can do much of what we did in our meetings and on the streets on the world wide web
2320849 the information technology available today could help end the need for those endless meetings
2320850 creating a blog could in fact incorporate even more voices and varieties of opinions and ideas than any meeting ever could
2320851 where act up once had chapters in many cities we could now involve thousands more via simple list serves and blogs we can draw in students and schools and colleges all over the world it is the young we have to get to once again
2320852 creating a blog would allow for expression and refinement of ideas and policies like a queer justice league for denouncing our enemies
2320853 a well organized website could function as an electronic clearing house for sharing information for posting problems for demanding solutions for developing and communicating action plans
2320854 list serves and a website could coordinate grassroots organizing and mobilize phone e mail and physical zaps or actions
2320855 we have been saying for years that we have to not only preserve our current fleet of nuclear plants but enlarge it significantly
2320856 the cost of whatever we are going to do is going to be big
2320857 you still have to mine the uranium used in the reactors and mining is a dirty polluting process and you have to store the nuclear waste somewhere waste that can be around for centuries sitting in a storage facility somewhere susceptible to leaks
2320858 the proposed yucca mountain nuclear waste dump is never going to open
2320859 i have successfully fought against the proposal to store nuclear waste in nevada for over two decades because it threatened the health and safety of nevadans and people across our nation
2320860 safe efficient inexpensive and obviously a vital ingredient in the future of the economy of our nation and in our mission to eliminate over time our dependence on foreign oil
2320861 everyones ok with it until they find out ones going in their backyard
2320862 screed again and ive come to the unfortunate conclusion that people of my late fathers generation brought us as much crap as they didnt
2320863 ping from his microphone was beyond my capacity to fix so were getting him a new mike and teaching him how to position it
2320864 at the end of it you might not even be able to get the money out anyway because someone will go and change the rules and say you cant take the money out
2320865 lightning can strike anywhere often with little warning so it is essential to have cover in place so that if the worst happens any cost for repairs or replacement of damaged property will be covered
2320866 seen this cycle time and time again so theyve had this experience
2320867 on a positive note swap rates have continued to fall and are now at their lowest level since 13 april
2320868 that means that abc news four well placed and separate sources fed them information that was completely false
2320869 the same government lab where the anthrax attacks themselves came from was the same place where the false reports originated that blamed those attacks on iraq surely the question of who generated those false iraq anthrax reports is one of the most significant and explosive stories of the last decade
2320870 no one food item can explain the entire outbreak although rare there have been outbreaks in the past in which more than one food source has been implicated

2320872 are the two members who couldnt even serve in the guard
2320873 hes probably got the most corporate memory right now of anybody on the budget
2320874 i came to sacramento to get things done and thats what my focus is and at the same time i really love people and have worked hard to build relationships
2320875 obviously from a philosophical perspective theres a bit of a distance between us but he has the ability to disagree without being disagreeable and is eminently fair in his approach to policy discussions
2320876 ive never seen john playing politics for the sake of politics
2320877 hes an honest person whos going to give you the straightforward perspective
2320878 john is easily one of the best politicians in the history of santa cruz
2320879 he not only takes on multibillion dollar structural deficits in california but also is willing to engage in issues like whether off leash dogs can continue to use the beach here in santa cruz
2320880 the first time i came here was a few years back the night of the marina challenge
2320881 el cerebro necesita reconectarse en el momento preciso cuando recibe un impulso sensorial ptimo
2320882 el ojo es el que dice cuando se deben realizar las reconexiones y no el cerebro
2320883 no s cu ntas veces tendr n que hacer esto los israel es para que la comunidad internacional abra sus ojos el mundo no ve que esto est destruyendo el proceso de paz
2320884 this increased cost estimate is reasonable given inflation and the expected increase in the amount of spent nuclear fuel from existing reactors with license renewals
2320885 we have marked significant project milestones this year and look forward to that progress continuing and nuclear waste currently sitting at 121 temporary locations around the country being safely stored at yucca mountain
2320886 yucca mountain is dead and it is time to move forward in a new direction with on site waste storage
2320887 yet there will be absolutely no public process to review these routes not by the nrc nuclear regulatory commission not by the doe and not even by the u s department of transportation this is a massive and dangerous shipping campaign but the nrc refuses to scrutinize it when considering does application to build the dump
2320888 doe does not even have complete plans to transport nuclear waste or to build the dump at yucca mountain which is in an earthquake prone environment
2320889 even worse the environmental protection agency has not decided what levels of radiation can be
2320890 there are too many problems with this project to list whether its the potential for groundwater contamination the feds inability to safely transport high level nuclear waste or the federal governments profound encroachment on states rights we must continue the fight against this ill conceived project
2320891 the department estimates that u s taxpayers potential liability to contract holders who have paid into the nuclear waste fund will increase from approximately 7 0 billion to approximately 11 billion if the opening of the repository is delayed from 2017 to 2020
2320892 the calculation of potential costs to taxpayers is a complex matter that depends on a number of variables that change year to year however on average the liability will increase 500 million annually
2320893 what were doing really is just looking at the feasibility of what we call units one and two the existing units there
2320894 were just right now exploring the feasibility of what it would take as far as licensing construction the whole ball of wax were looking right now along with our energy efficiency push at what are the best ways to meet the needs out there in the future
2320895 our main focus for the site continues to be the new start
2320896 tva is strategically building its nuclear generation portfolio which will reduce the valleys exposure to volatile commodity fuel prices
2320897 the technology has changed and i bring a more open mind to that subject now
2320898 prices for fuels have not just gone up theyve skyrocketed
2320899 i dont know how people are going to be able to survive people are going to starve to death
2320900 this is just a perfect storm for a bad situation
2320901 tvas fuel costs are up significantly and the drought is costing us more this year than last year because purchased power costs more
2320902 the continuing drought has produced a double hit not only are we suffering from higher prices were replacing low cost hydro with higher cost power
2320903 i knew with all that was going on in the energy market there would be some increase but had no idea it would be the magnitude of the percentage im hearing
2320904 that caught us a little off guard and its certainly a bad time to have an increase not that there is a good time
2320905 that program really helps it lets us help someone pay their utility bill so they can buy food or gas to go to work
2320906 turning away from the nuclear power phase out makes both ecological and economic sense and should be done
2320907 this isnt just a clear violation of the coalition agreement but it also shows that glos ministry is little more than an atomic energy lobby
2320908 environment minister sigmar gabriel should cease lashing out at all those who scrutinize the future of the power supply and energy security
2320909 it is vital that an industrialized country with 82 million inhabitants not march blindly into the power supply abyss
2320910 we think that means duke will have to repeat the whole test
2320911 we dont see this as a delaying factor as its been portrayed
2320912 testing data for the past several years will not be negated and will be valuable as we move forward with this important national security program
2320913 the expansion of nuclear energy in the united states as a major component of our national energy policy
2320914 the whole reason we started down this path was the benefits written into the energy policy act of 2005
2320915 is a joint government industry cost shared effort that can help provide solutions to meet future base load energy demand and address climate change specifically np2010 seeks to demonstrate new untested processes for licensing reactors in the united states identify sites for new nuclear power plants complete first of a kind engineering of new reactor designs develop and bring to market advanced nuclear plant technologies and evaluate the business case for building new nuclear power plants
2320916 a monumental step toward the rebirth of nuclear power in the united states
2320917 selected nustart to demonstrate the nrcs untested process for licensing new reactors in the united states and for obtaining regulatory approval of new reactor designs
2320918 safe clean and reliable and for the foreseeable future it is the only mature emissions free technology that can supply the power america will need to meet the projected increase in demand for electricity over the next 25 years this is one of the reasons we have put so much emphasis on bringing about a nuclear renaissance here in the united states
2320919 there is a concern within this administration which i support that the imposition of a carbon cap in this country would may lead to the transfer of jobs and industry abroad to nations that do not have such a carbon cap
2320920 you would then have the us economy damaged on the one hand and the same emissions potentially even worse emissions
2320921 in over 50 years of operating experience the nuclear industry still has not managed to solve the problems of safety security and disposal of highly dangerous radioactive waste
2320922 until that happens were much better off investing in safer cleaner energy sources such as renewable wind geothermal tidal and solar projects
2320923 if current trends continue and were in a position where we continue to see reductions in violence and stabilizations and continue to see some improvements on the part of the iraqi army and iraqi police then you know my hope would be that we could draw down in a deliberate fashion in consultation with the iraqi government at a pace that is determined in consultation with general petraeus and the other commanders on the ground and it strikes me that thats something we can begin relatively s oon after inauguration

2320952 you cant understand why anyone would want to read the daily mail apart from women who hate themselves
2320953 has it not occur to you that the model who made those accusations was just promoting her new job
2320954 you dont realise that the daily mail readers are predominantly female
2320955 shit it was the women all along we may as well pack up and go home
2320956 i dont see you criticising other shows like trinny and susannah which are equally as bad is that because theyre female presenters
2320957 or do you just have a problem the presenter because hes a man bearing in mind hes not quite a man hes a well known 100 homosexual
2320958 theyre daily mail readers either men who hate women or women who hate themselves
2320959 he said she said this does not mean that as far as i am concerned the debate is closed no what it does mean is that i am aware words are worth a buck or two
2320960 these seem to include wandering through shopping centres in the buff watched by her mortified children and padding down high streets in her scants

2320987 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil

2321010 the paper explores several aspects of human psychology but its principal finding is simple enough
2321011 the sweet escape effects of mortality salience on consumption quantities for high and low self esteem consumers
2321012 when you consider something like death after which there being no news flash to the contrary we may well go out like a candle flame then it probably doesnt matter if we try too hard are awkward sometimes care for one another too deeply are excessively curious about nature are too open to experience enjoy a nonstop expense of the senses in an effort to know life intimately and lovingly it probably doesnt matter if while trying to be modest and eager watchers of lifes many spectacles we sometimes look clumsy or get dirty or ask stupid questions or reveal our ignorance or say the wrong thing or light up with wonder like the children we all are it probably doesnt matter if a passerby sees us dipping a finger into the moist pouches of dozens of ladys slippers to find out what bugs tend to fall into them and thinks us a bit eccentric or a neighbor fetching her mail sees us standing in the cold with our own letters in one hand and a seismically red autumn leaf in the other its color hitting our sense like a blow from a stun gun as we stand with a huge grin too paralyzed by the intricately veined gaudiness of the leaf to move
2321013 there is no explicit requirement that xcel has to inform the commission before it rebills a customer for an inaccurate meter
2321014 however it is the scope of this thats concerning and its our expectation they xcel would have been in contact with our consumer staff earlier to work out any concerns our staff would have
2321015 it has all been very confusing for the people in their homes
2321016 with a colder than normal winter and with gas prices so high this rebilling just added to the trauma of all that
2321017 but when we think of those rules we think of them for isolated meters not 4 400 of them

2321253 you have to look at the long haul you have great angling that could get better those protected fish come down here and you may be seeing the effects of that
2321254 the fishing is better and its a lot more fun
2321255 you dont see the numbers down here that you do up there
2321256 people have been taking shots at me because of my involvement with the windego park society
2321257 this really gives everybody the rules of engagement on how to conduct themselves
2321258 were talking about when something is murky gray when something doesnt feel right
2321259 im going to vote for this because it is an improvement but im disappointed the full disclosure piece has been left out
2321260 i dont think that anyone on the council has intentionally ever tried to do something and not disclose it
2321261 others are very conscious about privacy and their right to privacy therefore they would not be willing to serve on a commission or volunteer for our city
2321262 there is a mechanism in place to address any allegations
2321263 there is a lack of public confidence in the city council
2321264 without full disclosure there cannot be a full and fair decision
2321265 dont you ever come up here and say this council is crooked and corrupt
2321266 i feel i have gone the extra mile with him
2321267 he has been censured by the city council for inappropriate behavior because of a conversation he had with a 20 year old woman at a community fund raiser in november of 2007 this conversation included intimate details about his current relationship
2321268 another time he had invited a woman at the park commission meeting to sit on his lap
2321269 schaffer has repeatedly distributed documents that have not been accurate in content
2321270 in january 2008 a letter was distributed that contained misinformation about a land deal between the city and village bank also that letter spoke about the financial director getting a 25 percent raise
2321271 various parties have sat down with schaffer showing the error of the report but a similar letter was still distributed to residents a month later
2321272 at a june 2008 planning commission meeting schaffer stated misinformation of land values
2321273 leroy has overstepped bounds several times in pursuing matters of city interest without first presenting those ideas to the council replacing the police force with the county sheriffs department a january 2008 city council meeting had schaffer in a shouting match with the mayor over the code of conduct schaffer is continuing to challenge this document both verbally and by conduct

2321275 no estoy satisfecho en parte porque creo que no han dado muchas explicaciones sobre la marcha de esta investigaci n no solo a m sino al pueblo estadounidense tampoco he visto las pruebas y pienso que dado su accidentado pasado y la dificultad que han tenido para ir al grano la torpeza con que fue manejada la investigaci n en lo concerniente a hatfill me lleva a ser muy esc ptico

2321329 estamos en los inicios en los cimientos de una construcci n que aspiramos tener un edificio muy alto muy alto muy alto y para eso necesitamos unos cimientos muy fuertes empezaron a dar frutos esos cimientos que fue la pretemporada empiezan a dar frutos nada m s pero no hemos hecho nada no hemos hecho absolutamente nada
2321330 bueno pero ha provocado muchos goles un jugador yo nunca he estado de acuerdo en darle cr dito nica y exclusivamente al jugador es m s yo creo que todas esas premiaciones que hay del goleador y no solo del goleador si no del mejor t cnico porque hay varias todas son individuales
2321331 yo pienso que simplemente se le debe dar al campe n porque el campe n es el equipo es en equipo es el trabajo es directiva cuerpo t cnico y jugadores lo dem s sale sobrando para mi se los digo en serio no creo en esos premios de l der goleador el campe n goleador no aqu en este equipo al que le toque meterla que bueno no solo de eso vive un jugador y menos premiarlos ni revisar desde cu ndo no mete goles si no ver cu ntos ha provocado es lo mismo para mi eso no cuenta
2321332 y kik n es un hombre que esta trabajando para el equipo y con el equipo entonces no me caus mucha sorpresa no sorpresa porque a este se or eriksson le gusta jugar por los lados tambi n le gusta tener extremos que por cierto ya les han nombrado de otra forma ni modo es problema de ustedes los medios medio por derecha medio por izquierda yo prefiero llamarle extremo por derecha y extremo por izquierda como siempre se les ha llamado pero es un extremo natural el kik n que as fue campe n con los pumas cuando hugo s nchez fue campe n dos veces aqu por las necesidades del equipo lo pusimos del lado izquierdo l kik n con su calidad profesional que tiene lo acept gustoso y nos ha dado resultados yo creo que las necesidades del equipo fue lo que priv en la conciencia del kik n y se merece el llamado a la selecci n

2321360 transit is very important if the metro area is going to move forward
2321361 and this committee has nothing to do with funding highways only transit projects
2321362 we have to have a mixed use transportation system with all types of alternatives
2321363 we cant build enough lanes including highways 10 and 65 to keep up with the growth of the metro area

2321367 we will not chase certain types of violations this is one of those situations

2321370 we need to balance the safety of the community against a stolen tv
2321371 if its a safety issue that a car pursuit is dangerous to other traffic and residents then i can understand that

2321390 there are too many examples of celebrities who get famous and then disappoint us with their failings theyre only human so as adults were not surprised but girls feel let down
2321391 what i did have was a passion for what i was doing helping girls by creating a forum to connect them to each other and show them that they are not alone
2321392 a magazine starring regular girls not celebrities or even models on the cover was a new concept and one that publishing experts had a hard time getting behind
2321393 just like anything new and unproven my ideas were met with a lot of skepticism they simply didnt believe ordinary girls could sell on newsstands
2321394 it was a relief to know that there were other girls out there exactly like me
2321395 i loved how discovery girls answered the questions that i was too afraid to ask or that older people in my life thought to be stupid or childish
2321396 discovery girls is a more wholesome representation of girls across the country i feel like there is starting to be a change and people are tired of being spoon fed stories about lindsay lohan and britney spears
2321397 when he first got there not only could he not swim but he used a kickboard and he was actually going backward
2321398 he grabbed my shoulder harder than in the beginning and i thought this is not good
2321399 he was bobbing in and out of the water and then we were both going down a bit
2321400 for him to sacrifice that goal and stop and help another athlete he still wound up not being the last out of the water
2321401 because periyakoil wasnt a strong swimmer it made him aware and more empathetic to the situation
2321402 i just think that during a race so many people are focused on themselves
2321403 kas took time out of his race to help somebody else it just shows the kind of guy he is
2321404 despite that he was still out there a lot of people would have quit at that point
2321405 its an honor to be with people like that and coach them i get more kicks from someone like him than seeing someone on a podium
2321406 we have seven guys that can throw in the low 90s and we can mix in a lefty bret maddox of tracy who can throw off speed and really locate

2321427 theres no single perfect number that will make you a happy and b not a slut
2321428 i think a bigger worry would be if the government withdrew its promise to grant residency visas for freehold purchasers and their families it is clear that a significant number of buyers in the market see dubai as a safeguard against trouble in their home countries and this safety net would be removed if that promise was not honoured
2321429 the main challenge is oversupply some projects coming on to the market in 2009 and 2010 will all be coming at one time
2321430 there is a high probability of late delivery and even project cancellation due to logistical constraints which could ultimately result in a better match between supply and demand
2321431 there are two things affecting supply and that is delays and construction constraint a lot of projects are coming to the market this year and next there is some risk as supply is catching up with demand starting next year
2321432 we know demand is strong there are still a lot of people coming to the uae and those people need accommodation
2321433 i honestly dont think oversupply is a concern at this point or over the next three years
2321434 if you look at the actually deliveries over the past two years you realise that only say 50 per cent of expected product is delivered on time in 2007 around 30 000 units were handed over compared to a forecast of 60 000 units the year before
2321435 delays are just part of the market in dubai and it may actually help in the long term by drip feeding supply instead of dumping a huge glut of new units all at once
2321436 in my opinion the iran situation is not going to dampen foreign demand at least in the short term historically iranians have been big investors in dubai and any escalation in the region could actually fuel further demand for property

2321449 it is unbelievable that real estate and construction which is the leading sector of the world economy is also the most primitive
2321450 most workers throughout the world still regularly use trowels that was first used by the egyptians and then by the romans buildings should not be different than any other product and from now on they will be manufactured in a production facility
2321451 it has been a while since i wrote my previous review
2321452 we are aware new visa rules will be implemented soon but we are still working on the same old visa and residency applications
2321453 so far everything in our system is the same including the online fees so far we have no instructions on the changes
2321454 we are looking at a lot of factors the index is a guideline for new people who are coming to dubai
2321455 the index will be introduced when were confident that its going to help the market
2321456 its a huge subject there is so much disparity in the market now some tenants are paying more than double what other tenants are paying within the same building
2321457 this will provide another excuse to the landlords to bypass the rent cap
2321458 they have tried all tricks in the past the rent index will provide the necessary tool for them to try and violate it
2321459 there is enough supply in the dubai market but because of greedy real estate agents or greedy investors they are keeping the ground
2321460 new projects are coming so people wont be able to leave their houses empty for a long time once the index is in place
2321461 it was awesome and i did not hesitate to pull over to watch this wonderful sight
2321462 the first tests have been conducted successfully and we are now testing it on the track

2321465 there wont to be 50 atlantis projects they are too big to do that i like them to be seen as more unique but atlantis here in dubai has a feel and a sense of place
2321466 we have land that still has not been developed beyond the waterpark and im hopeful that we will develop a cove atlantis there
2321467 ive seen it all since the royal mirage was in the desert its phenomenal how this place has grown i thought when we got to early 2000 it couldnt continue and it just continues and everyone is doing pretty well in the industry

2321552 bueno pero ha provocado muchos goles un jugador yo nunca he estado de acuerdo en darle cr dito nica y exclusivamente al jugador es m s yo creo que todas esas premiaciones que hay del goleador y no solo del goleador si no del mejor t cnico porque hay varias todas son individuales
2321553 yo pienso que simplemente se le debe dar al campe n porque el campe n es el equipo es en equipo es el trabajo es directiva cuerpo t cnico y jugadores lo dem s sale sobrando para mi se los digo en serio no creo en esos premios de l der goleador el campe n goleador no aqu en este equipo al que le toque meterla que bueno no solo de eso vive un jugador y menos premiarlos ni revisar desde cu ndo no mete goles si no ver cu ntos ha provocado es lo mismo para mi eso no cuenta
2321554 y kik n es un hombre que esta trabajando para el equipo y con el equipo entonces no me caus mucha sorpresa no sorpresa porque a este se or eriksson le gusta jugar por los lados tambi n le gusta tener extremos que por cierto ya les han nombrado de otra forma ni modo es problema de ustedes los medios medio por derecha medio por izquierda yo prefiero llamarle extremo por derecha y extremo por izquierda como siempre se les ha llamado pero es un extremo natural el kik n que as fue campe n con los pumas cuando hugo s nchez fue campe n dos veces aqu por las necesidades del equipo lo pusimos del lado izquierdo l kik n con su calidad profesional que tiene lo acept gustoso y nos ha dado resultados yo creo que las necesidades del equipo fue lo que priv en la conciencia del kik n y se merece el llamado a la selecci n

2321562 this store has some of the tackiest most disgustingly fruity scents ever does anyone remember the popular scent cucumber melon in college i couldnt go out with my sorority friends because the entire room stank like that smell ugh i cant figure out why their stinky yes they are stinky scents do well while their more subtle scents end up getting discontinued plus their lotions are greasy and some of their bath gels ingredients tend to separate the only scent i do like is their cotton scent which shockingly enough is subtle and doesnt smell like im 12 which is fine if youre around 12 but on a woman its just cheap its great for a clean bathroom scent but i would never wear it for the low quality ingredients and cheap and tacky smells this store is far too expensive youre better off going to target the body shop or going to body time which has both expensive and inexpensive things but doesnt make you smell like youre going to go stand on a corner but you can go here if youre planning on going to the rouge see my review
2321563 are you sure you want to do this i dont fight fair

2321580 the premier has indicated that consideration will be given to reviewing the secrecy provisions of the individual legislation we will do that legislation will be assessed to ascertain whether it is appropriate to remove secrecy provisions from specific acts rather than have a freedom of information bill which would eliminate all secrecy in one fell swoop
2321581 t he government of the day in 1988 promised the parliament and the community of new south wales that the secrecy provisions exemption would be reviewed the premier of the day committed the government to ensuring that all legislation containing secrecy provisions would be assessed to ascertain whether it is appropriate to remove secrecy provisions from specific acts the premier of that time failed to implement the promise and no action has been taken since we repeat the concern previously expressed that active reliance by agencies on secrecy provisions in their statutes could mean that the foi act will cease to have any application to many parts of the new south wales public service thus undermining the very purpose of that legislation secrecy provisions are a commonplace of agency statutes in new south wales the result is an unsatisfactory one

2321625 counties have been cutting the fat and the meat off those programs and in some cases cutting into the bone
2321626 if we see the pattern that weve identified continue the outcomes are likely to be harsher
2321627 we expect a lot more demand on these programs because of whats going on in the economy

2321633 within the week prior to denices death she was preparing to move back to houston texas

2321635 kalonji never made denice the beneficiary of any life insurance or retirements benefits nor made her the beneficiary of any will or trust
2321636 i had never made a will either before or during my relationship with denice and to my knowledge during her lifetime neither had she i operated on the assumption that having lived together for a number of years we were common law spouses and would be treated for all purposes as if we had been married

2322119 how can this man give us his flesh to eat
2322120 truly truly i say to you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and i in him as the living father sent me and i live because of the father so he who eats me will live because of me this is the bread which came down from heaven not such as the fathers ate and died he who eats this bread will live for ever
2322121 this is my body which is for you do this in remembrance of me
2322122 this cup is the new covenant in my blood do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me
2322123 now that you have had this teaching and are imbued with surest belief that what seems to be bread is not bread though it has the taste but christs body and what seems to be wine is not wine even if it appears so to the taste but christs blood
2322124 it is not the man who is responsible for the offerings becoming christs body and blood it is christ himself who is crucified for us the standing figure at mass belongs to the priest who speaks these words the power and the grace belong to god this is my body he says this sentence transforms the offerings
2322125 he used a demonstrative mode of speech this is my body and this is my blood to prevent your thinking that what is seen is a figure on the contrary what has truly been offered is transformed in a hidden way by the all powerful god into christs body and blood when we have become partakers of christs body and blood we receive the living giving sanctifying power of christ
2322126 the word transubstantiation came to be used by preference during the middle ages both as a reaction against certain theologians like ratramus who tended to see in the eucharist only a virtual and not a real presence of the body and blood of the lord and against others like paschasius radbertus who expressed his presence as if it were a question of a material and sensible one
2322127 to speak of transubstantiation comes down then to stating that it is indeed the very reality of the body of christ that we have on the altar after the consecration yet in a way inaccessible to the senses and in such a manner that it is neither multiplied by the multiplicity of the species nor divided in anyway by their division nor passible subject to suffering in anyway whatsoever

2322181 the novel tells the story of how hard case crime was founded in 1958 by a scoundrel who among other things thought it might be fun to publish a gangsters memoir only to find himself in hot water with both the mob and the police after learning that the memoir was not quite the true story hed thought

2322194 im asking you to give me a chance to come back
2322195 ive got some kids here i can save that i can make a difference in their lives
2322196 obviously i think thats great for galvestonians because had those two proposals passed i believe it would have been devastating to the citys operations
2322197 hopefully the public got educated on the effects of the things
2322198 i can only speculate but my opinion is that if he had the signatures he would have gone forward with it
2322199 you have to make a choice do we charge the person who lodged a police report claiming that the act had taken place
2322200 you see this water carefully contained on my hand it symbolizes love this is how i see it as long as you keep your hand caringly open and allow it to remain there the water will always be there however if you attempt to close your fingers round it and try to posses it it will spill through the first cracks it finds this is the greatest mistake that people do when they meet love they try to posses it they demand they expect and just like the water spilling out of your hand love will retreat from you for love is meant to be free you cannot change its nature if there are people that you love allow them to be free beings give and dont expect advise but dont order ask but never demand it might sound simple but it is a lesson that may take a lifetime to truly practice it is the secret to true love to truly practice it you must sincerely feel no expectations from those who you love and yet an unconditional caring
2322201 why should i try to deflect attention from the governments problems
2322202 government problems are huge this case is not going to deflect the governments problems i dont see that
2322203 how could i insist that he be charged if there is no evidence the police are not stupid to charge just because so and so have said charge im not one to say charge
2322204 i did say if you have something to charge if you have evidence then proceed with the charge if not drop it
2322205 you seem to think that anwar is more important this is an issue of law he saiful feels that he needs justice therefore he lodged a report

2322220 activists working to end israels occupation of the territories it captured in 1967 to stop its severe oppression of the captive residents of these territories and to reverse the rampant militarization of israeli state and society are often challenged by interlocutors as to the supposed absence of a movement of peaceful palestinian resistance
2322221 some of the brass are arguing that part of the operation was not sufficiently justified
2322222 has received legal authorization to confiscate income producing assets of hamas affiliated groups even if no clear link between the groups and terrorist activity has been proven
2322223 the activity in nablus seemed to some to have gone too far one senior official said he was concerned that the campaign would be seen as war against islam instead of a focused struggle against hamas and its terror activities
2322224 had he admitted he belonged to hamas we might believe him but since he denies everything we cannot believe a word hes saying and therefore suspect he is involved in military activity
2322225 upon the petitioners permission we examined the secret files and found that we have no reason to interfere with the decision the petitioner is a hamas activist who was involved in organizing a military activity that is dangerous for the area and as a result of this threat his appeal is denied
2322226 we are not limited in time because the accused is not in custody with regards to the present case
2322227 basicamente a ferrari tem mais uma tend ncia de sair de frente do que a mclaren a mclaren sai um pouco mais de traseira quando o pneu tem uma boa ader ncia o carro com a tend ncia de sair de traseira ser mais r pido em uma volta nica do que um carro neutro ou que sai mais de frente
2322228 mas quando voc fala sobre condi es de corrida especialmente com as temperaturas que tivemos em hungaroring ent o o carro que sai de traseira tem uma gera o de calor na parte traseira mais alta do que que um carro que sai de frente
2322229 por isso que a temperatura est fazendo a diferen a
2322230 quando as condi es do carro est o apropriadas para felipe suas qualidades s o de 110 mas uma vez que o carro n o esteja t o bom suas qualidades s o de 90
2322231 mas kimi consegue pegar o desenvolvimento do acerto em 100 mesmo se a condi o do carro n o estiver t o boa
2322232 basically the ferrari has more of a tendency to understeer than the mclaren
2322233 the mclaren is a little bit oversteery when the tyre has good grip the car with the oversteer tendency will be quicker over a single lap than a neutral or understeering car
2322234 but when you think about racing conditions especially with the temperatures we had at the hungaroring then an oversteering car will have heat generating at the rear much higher than the understeering car
2322235 looking at hungary and lewis hamiltons car behaviour after a few laps he struggled with oversteer so he was making lots of counter steering movements on the other hand the ferrari had a good balance after a few laps
2322236 when the car conditions are very suitable for felipe his abilities are 110 but once the car is not so good his abilities are 90
2322237 but kimi could get the package performance at 100 even if the car condition is not so good

2322242 because i had to go on richard amp judy yesterday
2322243 in cracking shape thank you getting better every day more and more shipshape and generally ready for action
2322244 its bigger than id expected much much bigger but also better its a very big job bigger more challenging more intellectually challenging than anything ive ever done i didnt really know what it would be like but i could tell it was a wonderful job i remember years ago when michael heseltine first started rabbiting on about it thinking golly that would be a fantastic thing to do
2322245 happy green clean safe yeah and pioneering on the whole environmental agenda taking that stuff seriously making london the centre of the new global green revolution you know if you want to flog a new green idea then london should be the place where it happens
2322246 because were going to appoint a superb environmental adviser very shortly
2322247 we will be building up a a strategy and you know revising a lot of the targets over the er next few months but im sticking to our general desire to reduce co2 by 60 by 2025 and you know youre going to see some really fantastic things on cycling i would say to people add that adjective i mean no cyclings not an adjective its a participle add that participle ok its going to be clean green safe and cycling
2322248 but i think his comments were capable of perpetual misconstruction which was not going to be helpful
2322249 i just think it would have made things very difficult for him it would have sent out a wrong signal to a large erm you know chunk of the london population that we werent here to work for all of them
2322250 and were here to work for everybody in london ok
2322251 well er im not quite sure its true i dispute your premise
2322252 nothing would make me happier than to be able to boast a top team that was more diverse
2322253 im a great believer in organisations that are run by women the spectator under me was a feminocracy
2322254 well id have to look at the numbers but my impression is that we are a completely equal opportunities employer and im absolutely determined to remain so
2322255 i think meetings can sometimes its a bit like running in a dream you get that heavy feeling in your legs and you feel you can hardly move its just like treacle and weve got some things done quickly but some things youve got to bang at and then youve got to bang again and keep banging so when you do come into government and im in government now you know im running this thing you find actually how much energy it needs to push things along and you need good people around you to help you push it along
2322256 its perfectly true that when i came in just as a short term measure i mean you know what plannings like its mega stuff youve got to look at big balsa wood models of new developments and youve got to get your head around the arguments so i said listen ive got a lot to do in the next couple of months so i did temporarily delegate my powers but ill be taking them back soon planning is central to my vision for london if youre going to build a wonderful site in the middle of london and youve got this epic opportunity to build something thats going to last for 100 years then for gods sake put something on it thats going to be worth looking at
2322257 a kind of garble that preserves intonation pitch and rhythm but erases content
2322258 were scarcely ever off the phone in fact im going to ring him now lets ring cameron

2322260 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2322261 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2322262 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2322263 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2322264 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2322265 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2322266 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2322267 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2322268 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2322269 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2322270 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2322293 were in danger of seeing the 2008 election stolen again as in 2000 and 2004
2322294 in florida in 2000 and ohio in 2004 we witnessed the obstruction and manipulation of votes by election officials and possible tampering with computer voting machines but equally insidious is the malapportionment of electoral college votes which disenfranchises whole sections of the voting public
2322295 the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states is denied or in any way abridged
2322296 if two thirds of the voters in a state vote for a candidate from party a and one third vote for a candidate from party b and the states winner take all rule gives all of the states electors to party a then one third of the voters have been disenfranchised in violation of amendment 14 section 2 of the us constitution
2322297 weve witnessed in election after election how some states have used the winner take all formula to prevent the votes of political ethnic and other minorities from being counted
2322298 alter the fate of the 2008 presidential election in a manner different from any presidential election in the nations history
2322299 by refusing to challenge electoral college malapportionment in 2000 and 2004 which blocked democratic electors from voting in those elections the democratic partys leaders abandoned tens of thousands of their own voters just as they failed to challenge the election irregularities in florida and ohio in 2000 and 2004
2322300 will they fail to challenge malapportionment again in 2008 and hand the republicans another victory barack obama would not be the democratic nominee if not for the democratic partys proportional assignment of primary delegates the winner take all provisions in the general election present the distinct possibility that mr obama in 2008 will win the popular vote by a considerably larger margin than did gore in 2000 but will repeat the democratic loss in the electoral college
2322301 if proportional assignment is considered by democrats to be vital to democracy in their primary elections why wont they fight for it in the general election
2322302 the democratize the electoral college program exposes the hypocrisy and fraud behind charges that the mckinney campaign might spoil the democratic presidential tickets chances of winning democratic leaders should have to explain why they choose to ignore 13 additional electors from southern states that theyd gain through the green partys presidential electors project why is the green party fighting to give voice to democratic voters that the democratic party will not fight for let me be clear were not doing this to assist barack obama but to foster real democracy and voter participation and to offer cynthia mckinney as the truly democratic choice for all the people
2322303 americans dont vote for president instead we vote for an electoral college which was created in the late 1700s to expressly increase the power of the slave states and which it is still doing
2322304 the electors in these southern states arkansas 6 electoral votes georgia 15 electoral votes louisiana 9 electoral votes tennessee 11 electoral votes texas 34 electoral votes are not bound by state law to cast their vote for a specific candidate

2322390 lightwave 3d gave us the power to create exactly what the director envisioned from duplicating the complex look of the amazing practical suit the animation of doors that get punched off their hinges to the volumetric smoke and debris when the mark 1 is flying and crash landing
2322391 lightwave 3d is a work horse for extremely talented artists like michael and his team who push it to the limit every day lightwave fits within any budget and pipeline

2322742 identity is not a private matter it is a social construction
2322743 the visible elements of a firm are held together by a set of shared beliefs sometimes implicit sometimes explicit that define its essence
2322744 i dimension gives the visible elements of the firm coherence and puts boundaries around how much change is possible without altering its essence
2322745 when identity becomes problematic leaders need to understand that they are confronting issues beyond strategy and that invariably involve struggles over the soul of their organization
2322746 just as the identity of individuals can be anchored in gender nationality social group educational credentials or particular skills an organizations identity resides in multiple anchors such as core business knowledge base nationality operating philosophy a legendary founder a governance structure or combinations of these
2322747 leaders ignore identity at their own risk and when identity is ignored it almost inevitably comes back to haunt them
2322748 changing the identity of an organization takes more than a new mission statement a new name or a new visual identity
2322749 no matter how attractive the job or the package if you are at odds with the soul of the corporation and if you are unwilling or unable to close the gap in one direction or the other you are stacking the odds of success against yourself

2322822 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
2322823 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
2322824 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
2322825 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment

2322833 many of the farming techniques used now are inadequate and there has been very little support for agricultural development

2322912 one problem with politicians is that when problems they create come to a head they typically feel this irresistible urge to do something rather than to un do something or to simply back off to avoid exacerbating the situation too often that which they end up doing has very little connection to the cause of the crisis but plays well in the press and superficially makes everyone feel better bills that are rushed through congress under duress are never studied enough providing too tempting an opportunity to quietly slip in unrelated provisions that erode freedoms in ways that would never pass as a stand alone bill we famously saw this with the patriot act but washington learned nothing from that

2322919 we suggest along with golf clubs and plenty of spare balls you bring binoculars and a camera as these are some of the best areas for whale and bird watching in the island at sunrise and sunset the location is spectacular for visitors exploration
2322920 whether you are a serious golfer or like serious fun its out there waiting for you at scotlands most remote golf experience
2322921 it is with great hope that some day this lighthouse golf course will be linked up with ones on foula and skerries to make a complete 18 holes the golfer that finds their way through such a golf course would undoubtedly have a story to tell
2322922 i will need an assortment available for all types of players men women kids and left handed anything that you can give will be greatly appreciated i am also very interested in any old stories from those people who might have played golf on fair isle in the past

2322948 after an ice shelf retreats beyond a critical limit it may collapse rapidly as a result of perturbated mass balance
2322949 they further show that drainage of melt ponds into crevasses were of no relevance for the break up at wis on wis the evolution of failure zones is associated with ice rises
2322950 the mechanisms for ice shelf thinning include basal melting meltwater production and rift development
2322951 the earth has a human induced fever and could overheat
2322952 any glacial experts out there care to total up this energy absorbed terawatts year and relate it to what the earths temp would be without this cooling provided by melting ice
2322953 significant decreases in sh sea ice are not expected yet but i havent examined the ensemble of model runs to see what their variability is like in sh sea ice gavin
2322954 the overall sh trends are not significant notwithstanding some big years recently trends in the different sectors are though
2322955 station temperature records for the past 50 years and report statistically insignificant temperature fluctuations over continental antarctica excluding the antarctic peninsula with the exception of amundsen scott south pole station which cooled by 0 17 k decade 1 for 1958 2000
2322956 the advent of satellite imagery since the mid 1970s enabled scientists to remotely view antarctica and measure the extent of sea ice this data shows little or no change or possibly even an increase in sea ice extent since the 1970s so what is happening is antarctic sea ice extent increasing or decreasing the answer is both the effect seen depends on the timescale we are considering
2322957 the role in the earths heat budget of the breakup of the ice shelves i do not know
2322958 scientists discover undersea volcano off antarctica sciencedaily may 31 2004 arlington va scientists working in the stormy and inhospitable waters off the antarctic peninsula have found what they believe is an active and previously unknown volcano on the sea bottom
2322959 wilkins ice shelf has experienced further break up with an area of about 160 km breaking off from 30 may to 31 may 2008 esas envisat satellite captured the event the first ever documented episode to occur in winter animation comprised of images acquired by envisats advanced synthetic aperture radar asar between 30 may and 9 june highlights the rapidly dwindling strip of ice that is protecting thousands of kilometres of the ice shelf from further break up
2322960 antarcticas massive wilkins ice shelf has begun disintegrating under the effects of global warming satellite images by the university of colorados national snow and ice data center showed with the antarctic summer drawing to a close scientists do not expect the ice shelf to further disintegrate in the next several months
2322961 want to falsify the hypothesis that humans are behind the current warming epoch all you have to do is come up with a physical dynamical model that does as good a job or better of explaining all the trends and doesnt include an increased greenhouse effect of course then you have to explain why the greenhouse effect should magically stop when co2 concentration goes above 280 ppmv
2322962 if somebody comes along and has the bright idea that say global warming is caused by phlogiston raining down from the moon that does not make everything we know about thermodynamics infrared absorption energy balance and temperature suddenly go away rather it is the job of the phlogiston advocate to quantify the effects of phlogiston on energy balance and incorporate them in a consistent way beside the existing climate forcings virtually all of the attempts to poke holes in the anthropogenic greenhouse theory lose sight of this simple and unassailable principle
2322963 get a lot of fresh water released from melting underneath it rises above the denser salt water and perhaps some of that freezes again around the edges during the winter as the airs cold id speculate thats happening people on the spot will find out

2322968 we have used a combination of historical tide gauge data and satellite altimeter data to estimate global averaged sea level change from 1870 to 2004 during this period global averaged sea level rose almost 20 cm with an average rate of rise of about 1 7 mm yr over the 20th century the sea level record indicates a statistically significant increase in the rate of rise between 1870 to 2004
2322969 this data has shown a more or less steady increase in global mean sea level gmsl of around 3 3 0 4 mm year over that period this is more than 50 larger than the average value over the 20th century whether or not this represent a further increase in the rate of sea level rise is not yet certain
2322970 in 1993 we predicted that this was going to be a vulnerable ice shelf
2322971 but we got the time scales completely wrong we were saying 30 years at that time and now its happened within 15
2322972 reconstructed spatial trends over 1993 2003 agree well with the regional sea level trends observed by topex poseidon

2322975 evidence for enhanced coastal sea level rise during the 1990s
2322976 current global model studies project that the antarctic ice sheet will remain too cold for widespread surface melting and is expected to gain in mass due to increased snowfall
2322977 observed estimates of ice losses in antarctica combined with regional modelling of ice accumulation in the interior suggest that east antarctica is close to a balanced mass budget but large losses of ice occur in the narrow outlet channels of west antarctic glaciers and at the northern tip of the antarctic peninsula
2322978 shepherd cautions that rignots three point trend shouldnt be projected decades into the future because theres reason to believe that the increasing amount of cold meltwater near the coast might slow further losses
2322979 we know the basics of sea level rise very well
2322980 we are getting a better understanding of our measurement systems and just how much we can trust our numbers
2322981 we know that sea level is not rising everywhere at the same pace and we are learning more every year about the natural variability in the ocean over short and long periods we are learning more about the exchange of heat between the ocean and the atmosphere the driving force of our climate
2322982 5 conclusions munk 2002 stressed that the sum of climate related contributions to sea level change was low 0 7 mm yr compared to the observations over the last 50 100 years 1 8 mm yr by referring to this factor 2 difference as the enigma of sea level change since then the more recent results now indicate a 1 mm yr contribution from the melting of global land ice reservoirs mitrovica et al 2006 as well as a 0 4 mm yr contribution from the thermal expansion of the world ocean antonov et al 2005 we show here an exercise of combining gps and tide gauge results that reduces the global average sea level rise to 1 3 mm yr this appears to resolve the sea level enigma
2322983 rough estimates of the change in ocean heat content suggest that the abyssal warming may amount to a significant fraction of upper world ocean heat gain over the past few decades
2322984 we are learning more every year about the natural variability in the ocean over short and long periods
2322985 arctic ocean expected to be ice free this september for the first time in 100 000 years
2322986 only 2 22 million sq km of ice less than the size of nunavut will remain in the arctic ocean this september this would be much less than the record low of 4 28 million sq km set in 2007
2322987 re 70 ray you have no clue who i am or what i understand but instead of dealing with the evidence you instead fall back on the default position of anyone who has their dogma questioned
2322988 models are imperfect attempts to represent what is known and used to make predictions
2322989 the agw community had to scramble to adjust their models because of the current no warming trend since 1998 indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the short and long term implications of climate forcing not to mention your negation of the fact that we are at the bottom of the 11
2322990 thus i ask again what will it take the planet to do to falsefy agw theory
2322991 and what after all is the purpose of the realclimate blog if i can spend 10 hours a day trying to help these readers then real scientists from realclimate could spend 30 minutes of their time surely
2322992 were toast if we dont get on a very different path
2322993 no one not lovelock or anyone else has proposed a specific quantitative scenario for a climate driven all out blow the doors off civilization ending catastrophe i think in general the consensus gut feeling among small minded working scientists like me is that the odds of such a catastrophe are low
2322994 the planet is cooling no temperature increases since 1998 or
2322995 i am a scientist and i think we should reduce co2 but the science is not settled yet and we should be cautious just look at the disaster of renewables from corn
2322996 stage 5 problem the stage 5 problem refers to the timing of the penultimate interglacial in marine isotopic stage 5 which appears to have begun 10 thousand years in advance of the solar forcing hypothesized to have been causing it this is also referred to as the causality problem
2322997 the warmest millennia of at least the past 250 000 years occurred during the last interglaciation when global ice volumes were similar to or smaller than today and systematic variations in earths orbital parameters aligned to produce a strong positive summer insolation anomaly throughout the northern hemisphere the average insolation during the key summer months m j j was ca 11 above present across the northern hemisphere between 130 000 and 127 000 years ago with a slightly greater anomaly 13 over the arctic greater summer insolation early penultimate deglaciation and intensification of the north atlantic drift combined to reduce arctic ocean sea ice allow expansion of boreal forest to the arctic ocean shore across vast regions reduce permafrost and melt almost all glaciers in the northern hemisphere insolation amplified by key boundary condition feedbacks collectively produced last interglacial summer temperature anomalies 4 5 1c above present over most arctic lands significantly above the average northern hemisphere anomaly the last interglaciation demonstrates the strength of positive feedbacks on arctic warming and provides a potentially conservative analogue for anticipated future greenhouse warming
2322998 last interglacial arctic warmth confirms polar amplification of climate change
2322999 but at the same time the atmospheric co2 level was only around 290 ppm so the explanation for the then warmer earth cant be greenhouse warming
2323000 from the viewpoint of science the north pole is just another point on the globe but symbolically it is hugely important there is supposed to be ice at the north pole not open water
2323001 the issue is that for the first time that i am aware of the north pole is covered with extensive first year ice ice that formed last autumn and winter id say its even odds whether the north pole melts out
2323002 since the connection to the island helps stabilise the ice shelf it is likely the breakup of the bridge will put the remainder of the ice shelf at risk
2323003 the question is what will happen when the ice reaches the tipping point at the end of june and the retreat steepens
2323004 our funds were low because ive been sick the last couple of years

2323025 john paddock will bring tremendous experience and leadership to the phantoms we are fortunate to have john working with and helping to develop our young prospects
2323026 it wasnt something that i was planning on when it happened this late in the summer when paul called it was an opportunity that presented itself that i couldnt let go by there are so many people in the organization that ive worked with coached and played with that there were too many signs pointing to it being a good thing
2323027 im very happy to get a chance to return to the nhl with the flyers
2323028 a year ago going back down to the phantoms as their head coach was a good opportunity for me to get experience and to show that i could be a head coach now getting a chance to go back to the nhl especially with the flyers is a good opportunity for me too
2323029 we have developed the mahl as an environment to develop players coaches and front office staff
2323030 don was instrumental in putting the vikings on solid footing for the coming season and his efforts were clearly noticed by the jackals
2323031 this was an opportunity that surprised me and one that flattered me
2323032 the mahl has been a terrific experience for me and this new position would not have been possible without having spent this time here in the mahl
2323033 i really want to thank andrew haines for his support and his confidence in my when i first started with the league
2323034 the mahl is much stronger now and that is a result of the tireless efforts of andrew and his staff i appreciate his efforts and look forward to long relationship with him and the friends and colleagues here in the league
2323035 the mahl is losing a talented young general manager but we see this as a natural progression for the league and wish don all the best

2323042 we opened saxa vord last may having worked very quickly to regenerate the site and to lessen the impact that was inevitable following the departure of the raf
2323043 over the last three years i have invested personally a seven figure sum in the site to date we have received no financial support from the unst response team although they have been approached on several occasions
2323044 we did not seem either to fit their investment profile or be able to come up with a business model that would allow them to invest
2323045 saxa vord is clearly a work in progress that will evolve and take shape as we consolidate and perhaps i was not taken seriously by the unst response team
2323046 shetland islands council on the other hand has been very supportive of our venture and while viewing our plans with natural caution have been a breath of fresh air to work with and even thrown in some matching funding
2323047 for my part our relationship was not productive and certainly they did not contribute to the revitalisation of the site or to the creation of the jobs within the resort
2323048 we thought it would perhaps be useful to have a small team there up in unst at ground level and to try to respond to the situation that was happening there
2323049 it was a time when people were going to be thinking about doing new things and we offered a point of contact for them there was a lot of uncertainty about what was going to happen
2323050 we wanted to try to do what we could to mitigate the impact of the raf leaving unst and arrange support to make sure people being made redundant had access to the right kind of support
2323051 things have moved on we had additional funds for unst and invested in a range of businesses and community interests and that has been very positive
2323052 the council also agreed to the funding of the new uyeasound pier and that has been beneficial to the community things in unst are looking more positive than they were a couple of years ago
2323053 im sorry but we have been standing here since 7 o clock and we really cant see anything at all
2323054 ill use it as a god damn mooring before you get your hands on it

2323060 i am pleased with the sqa examination results for anderson high school it seems that we have a general increase in achievement in line with the national picture our young people should be proud of their efforts
2323061 we had high hopes for class four of 2007 8 and i am pleased to note that they seem to have fulfilled their potential at all levels of ability there seems to be a significant increase from 2007 in those getting five or more credit level passes the highest level you can achieve in standard grade and just about everybody getting english and maths at some level
2323062 overall i would say pupils have more than matched expectations and its a reflection on the hard work leading up to exams thats gone in by staff and pupils at the school
2323063 this can be an anxious time for students and their friends and family however its important not to panic when the results arrive there is often
2323064 its vital for students to call the helpline as soon as they can as colleges and universities make their final selections once the results are out we can discuss the options and look at the different learning pathways and routes that are available to help the caller make an informed career choice that is right for them
2323065 we certainly monitor very closely our health figures or absence figures and we are very aware of those that are off for one reason or another and weve been working hard to get those figures as low as possible
2323066 at this moment in time i couldnt give an answer
2323067 but ill look into it ill certainly ask the questions
2323068 new york tops the list for the fourth year in a row for two reasons
2323069 first origination fees are swollen by taxes that the state levies directly on lenders which are passed along to consumers second lawyers customarily conduct closings in new york many closings are attended by at least three attorneys for the buyer seller and lender in some other states especially in the west closings are conducted by title agents and escrow officers who charge less than lawyers

2323071 i did you wrong you did me wrong i take you back you take me back
2323072 you are going to always have some problems you don t expect in situations like these and that s the point of doing these drills
2323073 this was still a controlled situation like smaller drills in the past
2323074 but we expanded things a bit we did this in a real building one that is actually located on campus we felt we needed to physically go through all the things we would actually have to do in this kind of situation
2323075 the message we want to send to parents and incoming students is that we do work very hard to try and be ready for any situation
2323076 we work as hard as we can on prevention but a drill like this also helps us to be ready for any occasion
2323077 as a scientist i believe strongly that different perspectives are important factors in enriching scientific investigation
2323078 many talented and creative scientists lie hidden in these groups and it is important to encourage these particular students at this formative point in their lives this little nudge might make all the difference in the major and career they wind up selecting
2323079 from the moment i talked with her i knew this would be an amazing opportunity for our students
2323080 because our students are the first in their families to go to college they dont have a great sense of what college is like having the opportunity to work in a science lab at stanford gives our students the confidence that they belong on a college campus and that they can compete there as well
2323081 my mom is part of a cleanup crew using green materials and was asked to help clean up jasper ridge
2323082 i went with her to help out and cindy wilber the education coordinator for jasper ridge happened to be there and asked if i would be interested in being a part of the science outreach program ive been doing it ever since
2323083 being involved in academia in this way at this institution really opens the eyes of the students and allows them to see firsthand that they can make it wherever they are placed
2323084 i feel that understanding how infants and toddlers take in information will help adults to get them the appropriate mental and visual stimulation they need to be prepared for school and beyond
2323085 understanding how a child is developing mentally will help me to develop closer bonds with patients
2323086 hearing from such a mixed group of great people who really love what they are studying has shown me what happens when you pursue a passion
2323087 i think being involved in research is always a great opportunity to think critically explore new areas of interest or learn new ways to think about what you thought you already knew
2323088 given freds interest in becoming a pediatrician my goal is for him to learn as much information as possible about how children develop
2323089 science outreach is one of my passions as a scientist
2323090 especially being a female scientist of color i believe there is an urgent and important need to have successful science outreach into communities where science is not a mainstream interest being a part of this program allows me to actively participate in my passion
2323091 he has been very supportive and encouraging at every step and has always had faith in me when im trying to learn something new whenever im unsure that i will be able to carry out a task on my own he pushes me to try it out by myself he is very patient and always explains things multiple times when i do not understand i really appreciate that he takes the time to help me learn and try out my skills
2323092 if you put the effort in to train the students to teach them about the project and show them how to do various tasks then they learn a bit more about science and at the same time help us get more work done
2323093 bryan is a very bright individual who has been more than capable of handling all of the tasks thrown at him so far and above all he seems even more interested and knowledgeable about science after being here
2323094 i am incredibly impressed by the enthusiasm and support the faculty and mentors are providing the students in the program as for the students themselves they are a delight to work with they are inquisitive hard working and very appreciative working with them makes coming to work a real pleasure

2323101 the committee has concluded from its review of health based evidence that short term exposure to ambient ozone is likely to contribute to premature deaths
2323102 studies have yielded strong evidence that short term exposure to ozone can exacerbate lung conditions causing illness and hospitalization and can potentially lead to death
2323103 the report is a rebuke of the bush administration which has consistently tried to downplay the connection between smog and premature death
2323104 may be larger than those observed in acute effects studies alone
2323105 this has been used by industry to try to attack health standards by minimizing the societal benefits

2323110 say you dont think theres any chance in the world do you
2323111 de wedstrijden tegen bate zijn nu voorbij maar niet vergeten het is niet door de supercup te winnen dat we die uitschakeling zullen uitwissen je kan gewoon niet uitwissen wat onuitwisbaar is
2323112 hoelang deze uitschakeling in de hoofden van de spelers zal blijven spelen weet ik niet maar we voelen ons slecht we blijven achter met een gevoel van veel te weinig een gevoel van schaamte ook met alle respect voor bate maar ondanks de kwaliteiten van de wit russische ploeg moet anderlecht zich tegen zon team altijd kwalificeren
2323113 i absolutely dont see a club in crisis it is the best squad this club has had probably in a generation
2323114 sixth and fifth place finishes in the toughest league in the world says an awful lot
2323115 this morning i was down at the training ground we are just going into our second year there and its a fantastic facility
2323116 season ticket numbers are ahead of where they were last year and its the first year of our new record chang deal which is worth about 50 per cent more than the previous deal
2323117 im new into this job but i am coming into it with a very very strong management team its a team i am very confident in there are plenty of good things going on at the club
2323118 the impact of the stadium was going to be phenomenal on kirkby and it was going to be great for everton so it is a surprise and a blow
2323119 i walked outside took a picture of the bike went back inside and posted the ad and was just leaning back in my chair after publishing the ad when you called
2323120 i should explain to your lordship what is meant by crackers a name they have got from being great boasters they are a lawless set of rascalls on the frontiers of virginia maryland the carolinas and georgia who often change their places of abode
2323121 the word cracker is supposed to have been suggested by their cracking whips over oxen or mules in taking their cotton to the market
2323122 i hope to play for another two or three years
2323123 i may be 38 in september but i played 47 games last season captained the club and long may that continue
2323124 i look at the results last season and we beat the likes of leeds twice in the big games we proved we could do it
2323125 our away form was awful and it needs to improve but this is a fortress here at whaddon road
2323126 if we continue that form and pick up a few more points away from home theres no reason why we cant be an established league one team and by that i mean a top 10 finish
2323127 i want to stay in the game and the shop will probably look after itself
2323128 i dont actually have to be around that much but i like to be i like to oversee things
2323129 no doubt in my mind that john mccain will do a far better job of protecting israel and the united states from these wackos in iran

2323138 ik heb daniel via hyves opgesnord daar speelde ik vroeger mee in een bandje leuk om weer eens wat van hem te horen
2323139 ik heb chantal leren kennen via arie en zij is net als ik zon fan van anouk we delen nu regelmatig concert fotos
2323140 toen we een partner voor productontwikkeling zochten trof ik via een hyve een bedrijf uit bemmel die zich met precies hetzelfde bezig houden volgende week hebben we een inventariserend gesprekje om te kijken wat we voor elkaar kunnen betekenen
2323141 when you arrive at 8 30 in the morning for this its literally a mountain of papers
2323142 but by the end of the day its gone all stuffed into packets and mailed out
2323143 weve been doing it a couple years now so weve been able to streamline the process and make it more efficient and fine tuned
2323144 but its less daunting with so many hands helping more hands mean more fun
2323145 but its also exciting to look at your class schedule and think about everything youll be doing for the next year
2323146 this is one of the most incredible ptas ive experienced
2323147 when we did focus groups with women on this we found that women feel pressure in their lives to be good wives good mothers and good at their jobs and these getaways gave them away to ease some of that they found it very relaxing
2323148 there are a lot women trying things that they wouldnt normally do
2323149 im probably the healthiest ive ever been in my life
2323150 now every project has to do with health and wellness
2323151 its really fun for all the kids that participate and everyone learns from each other
2323152 it has a real family feel to it were calling each other sister brother mother and we certainly consider ourselves more than just a theater troop
2323153 he didnt love it at all in fact he wouldnt participate
2323154 he just having a great time its such an enjoyable experience
2323155 we hope to continue to offer great shows in the future
2323156 hes my son and im proud of him but he made a bad mistake
2323157 somebody is celebrating a birthday or the 4th of july late
2323158 we discovered that over the last few years we had both been inundated with phone calls and emails from people keen to build their own green roofs or to convert their sheds and existing roofs to green roofs as enthusiasts it is difficult not to reply to emails and answer phone calls but both struggle to keep up so we decided to write the guide to try and give people a starting point
2323159 we also want to challenge the ikea approach to green roofs you dont have to go out and buy a system you can source all the individual components yourself hopefully locally and create your own unique green roof that is the second point of the guide
2323160 we both got involved in green roofs out of a love of nature and both think green roofs are one of the simplest and most cost effective ways to put something back big green roofs on large developments are one thing but there is also a huge appetite out there at the micro level this guide hopes to meet that appetite not only in the uk but also in north america australia and throughout europe i have had emails from people as far afield as japan and st kitts in the west indies from people wanting to do a green roof on their garden shed
2323161 when i started out 10 years ago i just wanted to build green roofs there was no information out there to help me so i had to learn through experience only every small building i have built has had a green roof installed and over 10 years you realize that it can be quite simple at the end of the day dusty and i just want to see more green roofs and we hope this guide helps add to what is already happening out there on the larger scale
2323162 the hmong community is saddened and heart sickened by rep betty mccollum at this time for engaging in the deplorable wholesale appeasement of the lao military junta betty mccollum has failed the hmong people in st paul minnesota and those suffering and dying in laos and thailand
2323163 tough economic trade and diplomatic sanctions are what is need now to demand and press the lao military to end their terrible campaign to massacre and starve to death thousands of innocent unarmed hmong civilians in laos but instead representative betty mccollum seeks to reward the lao government with millions of dollars in u s taxpayers assistance and enhanced normalized trade relations ntr
2323164 war crimes mass starvation and atrocities were committed by the lao military against unarmed hmong women and children which rep mccollum ignored and instead worked to reward the corrupt and despotic lao military regime with millions of u s taxpayers dollars in the form of lower tariffs and foreign aid so that the lpdr regime can continue to finance their war of genocide and ethnic cleansing against thousands of innocent hmong people
2323165 the hmong people and the hmong american community in st paul and across the united states feel strong that it is deplorable and unforgivable that rep mccollum has also proactively sought to send tens of millions of additional u s taxpayers
2323166 clearly congresswoman betty mccollum owes a major apology to the hmong community in the united states as well as in her district in st paul she should apologize to the hmong community publicly and introduce new legislation in the u s congress to seek to revoke ntr trade status and foreign assistance to laos since ntr has been counterproductive regarding the lpdr regimes horrific violation of international law and ongoing genocide campaign against the hmong no u s taxpayers

2323172 while some readers believe there is some resemblance between them an important difference between jack london and martin eden is that martin eden rejects socialism attacking it as slave morality and relies on a nietzschean individualism

2323174 there are elements within the u s administration who would be very nervous about musharraf leaving the scene as they think the civilians are not in control of the army and isi pakistans inter services intelligence agency

2323210 acting with intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense he solicits encourages directs aids or attempts to aid the other persons to commit the offense
2323211 if in the attempt to carry out a conspiracy to commit one felony another felony is committed by one of the conspirators all conspirators are guilty of the felony actually committed though having no intent to commit it if the offense was committed in furtherance of the unlawful purpose and was one that should have been anticipated as a result of the carrying out of the conspiracy

2323222 cito is going to have a big hand in what kind of staff we have here
2323223 its important that hes comfortable with the staff i think bringing gene tenace and nick leyva here was important to him at that time well see how it goes
2323224 but it has been a couple of years since we experienced a similar shortage
2323225 but you never know whats going to come into the emergency room
2323226 we are receiving a good response but because our inventories are so low it takes a while to build up
2323227 we want to encourage people to get out there and donate
2323228 there was no negotiation there was never any substantive talk of what they would take
2323229 all of that was speculation from the beginning i think it was clear it was a bad situation in green bay and they had to deal with it any way they could
2323230 green bay never told us what they were interested in trading him for
2323231 really it never got to any of that he wasnt a free agent we never believed they were going to release him that wasnt their intention it wasnt that type of process
2323232 i said we never believed they were going to trade him to the buccaneers
2323233 were going to listen to peoples thoughts if theres a way itll benefit the buccaneers

2323239 it is no question that this has saved peoples lives
2323240 from what the doctor had told me is that if i had not received care as quickly as i did i would not have survived this
2323241 not only did they save my life i also have no damage to my heart
2323242 and we exceeded that benchmark we do much better than that
2323243 its the same procedure just given on a non emergency basis
2323244 our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter
2323245 mijn hoofd staat nu niet naar een transfer op dit moment ben ik niet klaar om over geld te praten als de club geld nodig heeft is dat een vraag voor herman van holsbeeck als er een interessant voorstel komt zal ik dat uit principe bekijken maar na mijn terugkeer uit argentini heb ik voor mezelf beslist om bij anderlecht te blijven
2323246 het kan dat de club mij wil verkopen maar daar heb ik zelf nog niet bij stilgestaan hier had ik helemaal geen rekening mee gehouden het is nu aan de club om te beslissen wat er met mij moet gebeuren dit is doodzonde maar in de competitie kunnen we nog veel rechtzetten
2323247 als ik een heel concete aanbieding krijg zal ik daarover eerst goed nadenken ik ga daar dan zeker niet halsoverkop over beslissen we zullen de komende weken wel zien wat er gebeurt

2323293 the lord is my light and my salvation whom then shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom then shall i be afraid
2323294 i am still convinced of this i shall see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living wait on the lord be strong and take heart cheer up and wait on the lord
2323295 god is the source of life and light and joy to the universe
2323296 it has very little geometry it has a lot to do with the soul the spirit the mind the miracle of balance for the human being starts with the passion of wanting to become almost a bird not just a formula i like to label myself half man half bird
2323297 it was one of the last films to screen long after those dreadful people from l a had gone away so there was no real buzz on the film going into it no one from the industry saw it no one even reviewed it yet people really liked it and it became an audience film it felt like an honest triumph
2323298 to be able to perform at that height for that length of time its just mind boggling
2323299 people love seeing the towers being built americans are happy to be able to feel about the towers in a different way as theyre created i think this film is about the life or part of the life of the towers
2323300 they also respond to the spirit of the adventure my naivete the simple poetry of it
2323301 it was treated as one of those stunts in a family of stunts one of those extraordinary events in the city
2323302 of course its absolutely anything but a stunt its a performance
2323303 thats when it became obvious to me that it was more like a heist film than a documentary therefore you can use some of the habits and characteristics of the heist film youve got overlapping timelines you can open with the day its going to happen then you can flash back to characters and events
2323304 so many of the details appear preposterous or fanciful but they checked out with four or five accounts we had there are differences of temperament or emotions but not differences of fact
2323305 titanic attempts to capture the pathos of the night the famous ship went down a full orchestra and more than 40 actors bring the passengers and crew to life as elation turns to disbelief then despair then hope broadway staging won five tonys including best musical
2323306 episode iv a new hope the 1977 lucas directed movie that introduced the world to jedi knights and lightsabers
2323307 the series the epic itself is basically about one man so its very very narrow
2323308 you pass through a lot of things and you look and whats that over there but you never get to look at it this allows us to look at all that stuff which means were not encumbered by this mythological uber story
2323309 we did not make this in a normal way you make an animated feature
2323310 you see more and more artists using that technique using that device to create all kinds of paintings and drawing
2323311 i think youre going to see a big outburst of that in animation as well over the next few years
2323312 and i looked at them on the big screen i said this is fantastic
2323313 could any new ballet company have begun with more goodwill and eager applause than christopher wheeldons morphoses
2323314 it was kind of disappointing but also to be expected
2323315 there was a lot of buildup for us last year and a lot of press one gets built up to the point where its very easy to be in the position where people can pull you back down again
2323316 i dont have an enormous wealth of explanation as to why that was the case i think maybe we were in a position of the expectations being perhaps a little too high i think it was probably quite easy to forget that were still a very young company
2323317 even though the caliber of dancing is really high and we have all these wonderful dancers from all over the world we were still very much trying to get up on our feet
2323318 it was great to have the support of the times and all the critics coming out and seeing us
2323319 but i think the original intention was that vail would be a place for us to kind of make our first appearance under slightly less pressured circumstances
2323320 weve done pretty well as far as our finances are concerned from last year and also just artistically weve grown in the way were programming this year so i feel like were following our mission were moving forward in the right direction
2323321 at this point were still in a position where were building infrastructure so we can hopefully go ahead and hire full time dancers soon
2323322 but thats all very much dependent obviously on fundraising and getting everything in its place
2323323 the reception was wonderful the public were incredibly warm everyone was very supportive it seemed like there was a lot of goodwill behind the launch of morphoses up here which of course made it exciting for us to come back again this year
2323324 yes i was my responsibility and my fault and you shouldnt blame someone else for what i did
2323325 support for the iphone in lotus notes is only ibms latest step in investing in apples platforms as a competitive alternative to microsofts windows
2323326 it has been easier learning the mac than learning vista
2323327 ibms inotes is the latest example of how the iphone is helping to stoke interest in apples hardware software and development tools in the enterprise in its initial iphone 2 0 announcement apple stated that over a third of fortune 500 companies had sought access to the companys ongoing iphone enterprise beta program
2323328 all i kept saying after the bootup was gtfoh that wee asus eeepc 1000h puts my frikkin desktop running windows xp to shame the speed that speed gtfoh
2323329 a willful disregard for the health and safety of those using the facilities
2323330 whoa i dont care who youre playing against 41 points 11 boards and 4 blocks is sick
2323331 not 900 000 or 1 1 million but a million on the dot
2323332 you need a lawyer to go to the beach these days
2323333 this is like buddy holly the day the music died it is sad for all sports fans because this guy was not done it is not that he was hanging on
2323334 this is in many ways sad that this is where it came to at the end of the day though we felt like i think all the parties involved felt like it was the best solution to a very difficult situation
2323335 but the relationship got to the point where it couldnt go forward dont try to blame either side its like a marriage that ends it happens and neither party is at fault but you move forward
2323336 i think were all sad to see brett favres career as a packer end but we are glad that this matter has come to closure in a way thats good for the team and good for brett
2323337 i was just looking for him to tell me that he was ready to play for the green bay packers
2323338 and if we would have got to that point then our conversation would have continued and it did not get to that point
2323339 despite opinions to the contrary i like brett a lot
2323340 id love to see him have the time of his life
2323341 i told him he could help with the quarterbacks but i dont want any new plays
2323342 this is important to him he recognizes that when you step out of whats happened and everything he has a very positive opinion about the fans the experience hes had with his family he didnt want to do this to his teammates any more he felt it clearly went on long enough
2323343 put it this way if two small agencies down in d c are getting these prices everyone in new york would be out of business from a buying standpoint
2323344 we worked very closely with both campaigns to provide them with this singular opportunity to reach millions of american voters
2323345 we are pleased that for the first time in many years the candidates running for president of the united states have chosen the olympics to deliver their messages to the nation
2323346 he made sure he was winding that thing as fast as he could and it was an eye opener for us
2323347 the biggest challenge is going to be when you throw the deep ball that is incomplete and that guy has to catch his breath and get back to the huddle as fast as he can
2323348 there is no question the length of games in college football have been a hot topic
2323349 weve been trying to find the right balance for a couple years
2323350 to me thats an even greater reason for this change
2323351 it eliminates that element based on the pace of the referee
2323352 we have been marketing in spanish language since the mid 1970s
2323353 we seek to grow our business by identifying trends that provide substantial growth potential and seek to serve customers of many ethnic backgrounds
2323354 it is an unusual city in regards to corporate giving
2323355 the public spirit of its business community about your remarkable five percent club that i feel a bit like dorothy in the land of oz i had to come to the emerald city myself to see if it really exists
2323356 you know that point in your life when you realize that the house that you grew up in isnt really your home anymore maybe thats all family really is a group of people who miss the same imaginary place
2323357 this is my life dad this is it i spent 26 years waiting for something else to start so no i dont think its too much to take on because its everything there is i see now its all of it you and i are gonna be ok you know that right we may not be as happy as you always dreamed we would be but for the first time lets just allow ourselves to be whatever it is we are and that will be better ok i think that will be better
2323358 if you cant laugh at yourself life is going to seem a whole lot longer than youd like
2323359 i know it hurts but its life and its real and sometimes it fucking hurts but its life and its pretty much all we got
2323360 so going from one job to another is really exciting for me after all these years
2323361 i dont think its something that people would run into theaters to see
2323362 i think its a very relatable time for a lot of people people trying to start their own lives
2323363 im looking forward to some jobs where things are kind of ready ahead of time and im excited from the get go and theres no tweaking that has to be done on my end
2323364 im so glad so many people loved the show the way they did and they can still watch the dvds
2323365 a lot of people say thats just the relationship i had with my mother or i wish i had that relationship with my mother
2323366 episode iv a new hope the 1977 lucas directed movie that introduced the world to jedi knights and lightsabers
2323367 the series the epic itself is basically about one man so its very very narrow
2323368 you pass through a lot of things and you look and whats that over there but you never get to look at it this allows us to look at all that stuff which means were not encumbered by this mythological uber story

2323372 and i looked at them on the big screen i said this is fantastic
2323373 are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head
2323374 we couldnt all be cowboys so some of us are clowns
2323375 some people argue that the federal ban on abortion was just an isolated effort aimed at one medical procedure that its not part of a concerted effort to roll back the hard won rights of american women that presumption is also wrong
2323376 there was already a law in place in illinois that said that you always have to supply lifesaving treatment to any infant under any circumstances
2323377 where babies were being aborted alive and shelved to die in the soiled utility room
2323378 if were placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a pre viable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as as is necessary to try and keep that child alive then were probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality
2323379 illustrates the neoconservative ostrich ideology as long as we dont admit the truth it doesnt exist
2323380 a soldier cheap to the king and dear to me
2323381 we believed we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
2323382 depends on how well the elimination went and how narrow the funnel ends up at the end
2323383 in both cases they were looking back in the history of a quirky personality to suggest because of the quirky personality maybe the person would be malicious
2323384 thats a leap that you dont usually make in court
2323385 theyre taking a weird guy and convicting him of mass murder
2323386 this continues the run of bad news on the housing market declines have been pretty unrelenting for the last six months
2323387 talk of the increasing chances of a recession more weakening in the housing market and the continuing rise of food and energy costs will have further dented confidence as will reports of job losses
2323388 hes got to put in one year of solid work and no issues and so forth and hell be welcomed back in next season if he makes it through the year
2323389 everybody else was trying all these gimmicks in their speeches like stepping down into the crowd or listing their accomplishments in student government
2323390 i just thought it would be best to get people excited about the program so i talked about what a great opportunity we have
2323391 there were so many brilliant kids there it was incredible to get to hear their views firsthand even if you didnt agree he said
2323392 back in greenwich you can sit around a debate the issues that dont always directly impact on your life
2323393 but when you talk to kids who are dealing with those issues the alaskan kids who support oil drilling or the texan kids who have twenty new students in their class every year because of immigration then its different
2323394 it really opens your mind and gives you something to think about
2323395 this is fatal and his blood is getting thicker his heart valve can close any time and kidneys have started malfunctioning
2323396 critical situation he has developed acidosis which is relatively serious condition
2323397 yes i got a call from our aphc office muzaffarabad i am told that the traders business houses private and public institutions and government departments will rush a marathon relief rally to uri via muzaffarabad road i will shortly meet all the senior leaders especially syed ali gilani to evolve a joint strategy about how to organize all this
2323398 the biggest thing is when you know your reads and know where you are going with the ball the footwork comes naturally and is easier
2323399 i did work on it this summer and i just have to keep getting better it was a good start but we just have to keep working
2323400 he looked smooth in the pocket and his footwork was good i was impressed with his overall play
2323401 international community should come to know that even democratic expression is not allowed in occupied kashmir
2323402 i dont know if i could have one if i wanted to
2323403 joe would get upset and overpower you on the next play
2323404 with me im going to get upset and im going to outsmart you on the next play
2323405 i went down there with a chip on my shoulder
2323406 being out on the field a little more i started to learn what to expect
2323407 after the first few swings today it looked like his normal swing and he was driving the ball out of the ballpark
2323408 i dont know if hell be able to play right away he might have to pinch hit for a few games
2323409 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2323410 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2323411 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2323412 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2323413 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2323414 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2323415 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2323416 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do

2323423 after 100 years of olympic history this is the first time china has had the games
2323424 after 100 years of olympic history this is the first time china has had the games
2323425 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2323426 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2323427 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2323428 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got
2323429 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2323430 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2323431 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2323432 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got
2323433 ive just always thought winning a gold medal would mean more than being a world champion or winning all that money or anything
2323434 i hit a couple out there that might have got close to 400 today
2323435 that was the goal at the beginning of the year to make the ryder cup team
2323436 ive put myself in a situation where i have a chance you can play for your country and to do it in your home state that would be a dream come true
2323437 i really felt like i almost shot the highest score i could have shot today
2323438 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2323439 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much but if every time you hit it you hit it right where youre looking then whale away
2323440 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2323441 i hit a couple out there that might have got close to 400 today
2323442 that was the goal at the beginning of the year to make the ryder cup team

2323448 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2323449 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2323450 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games

2323452 on the way home from london two mums were harassed on the tube in two separate events one mum was tutted at loudly for feeding her crying baby another was shouted at by a male commuter who didnt want to see that
2323453 no wonder mums are inhibited from breastfeeding in scotland the law was followed by a very thorough campaign to let everyone know that this was utterly unacceptable
2323454 the hatred is frightening all it takes is one article in a local english newspaper to scratch the surface and it all comes pouring out
2323455 ninety percent of all statistics can be made to say anything fifty percent of the it is only when i travel i allow myself the guilty pleasure of the morning shows
2323456 and the root of it is probably this obama has been a sojourner
2323457 american voters have trouble placing him in his context understanding the roots and values in which he is ineluctably embedded
2323458 if you grew up in the 1950s you were inclined to regard your identity as something you were born with if you grew up in the 1970s you were more likely to regard your identity as something you created so cautiously the country watches this should be a democratic wipeout but voters seem to be slow to trust a sojourner they cannot place
2323459 this is a great location to raise your family perfect for a home based business vacation or second home or ideal for a tree plantation
2323460 the seller is motivated and pre auction offers are being considered an offer made before the auction date just might be accepted taking into consideration todays market this real estate is an affordable property positioned to sell when the last bid is called and the final gavel falls you could be the qualified buyer

2323465 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola
2323466 producers such as venezuela could let production fall and nationalize the oil industry because there was no punishment for doing this when prices kept rising
2323467 proponents of peak oil who dont have the foggiest knowledge of petroleum geology
2323468 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola
2323469 all the official rock the vote events are private fundraisers
2323470 i wanted to do something the general public could come to
2323471 im certainly the last person to give advice on well anything
2323472 he has a full schedule for next week and is looking forward to getting back to work
2323473 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person and a player
2323474 he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything he has done
2323475 im happy with the people we have here right now
2323476 we have three quarterbacks right now on the team and were finding it hard right now to get all three of those guys the work they need but were doing that
2323477 a review by the new england journal of medicine in 2006 concluded that there was a strong connection between the consumption of trans fats and coronary heart disease
2323478 it says that we have come a long long way and that the people who were counting on racial voting to prevail are thinking of a memphis that doesnt exist anymore
2323479 the people of memphis are more sophisticated voters that deal with issues and someones record and not simply race and i think its a story of america because i know of no other place in america where there would be such a vote
2323480 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee its time to turn the page on a politics driven by negativity and division so that we can come together to lift up our communities and our country
2323481 its going to be a great atmosphere for the first game
2323482 we have to play with that hunger and that desire in order to come out and be successful hopefully going into the first game we really come up to the plate early and try to make a statement about how were going to play throughout the tournament
2323483 by no means a situation where its going to be handed to us
2323484 weve got to go out and take it and were definitely going to be put to a challenge
2323485 everyones role is clearly defined when they come into the game they know they have to bring energy bring that hunger
2323486 obviously by what happened in oh four lebron d wade melo boozer are really doing a good job of showing that hunger and i think everybodys following their lead
2323487 but more importantly just go out there and play great defense try to knock down open shots obviously we have a lot of firepower on both ends and weve got guys that can play several positions so a lot of guys are interchangeable
2323488 i know people label me as a great defensive player
2323489 but a great defensive team will beat a great defensive player any day
2323490 we know that with the guys we have were not going to have a problem scoring so if the defense is there every night in case the offense slips then we still have a chance to win the ball game
2323491 the pick and roll is obviously the hardest to defend in any game whether its international or in the nba or in an oriental country
2323492 the good thing about it is we have guys like dwight and chris bosh who are quick and athletic than can be able to get up there
2323493 also we have guys on the weak side like deron and d wade and melo and those guys can be able to cover the basket while the bigs are away from the basket then again we have guys at the four spot that are able to switch or able to do different things in case we do get hurt i think thats one thing about this team is we have a lot of guys that are able to play different positions guard different players so if theres a certain situation where pick and rolls are hurting us we have different options
2323494 its going to be a great atmosphere for the first game
2323495 we have to play with that hunger and that desire in order to come out and be successful hopefully going into the first game we really come up to the plate early and try to make a statement about how were going to play throughout the tournament

2323499 obviously by what happened in oh four lebron d wade melo boozer are really doing a good job of showing that hunger and i think everybodys following their lead
2323500 but more importantly just go out there and play great defense try to knock down open shots obviously we have a lot of firepower on both ends and weve got guys that can play several positions so a lot of guys are interchangeable

2323507 i dont have any tickets to olympics events but my family and i will watch them on tv we are looking forward to watching the sports that china will excel at like ping pong and badminton
2323508 these types of things happened only once in a thousand years

2323510 we will go home tonight to watch the opening ceremony together because we dont want to run into crowds outside
2323511 its not my olympic games its not the games for the ordinary people
2323512 i want to say something international olympic committee president jacques rogge has said the games will bring fundamental changes to china i will reserve my opinions on that
2323513 i believe that eight is a good luck number but today is 88 days since the wenchuan earthquake so i have my doubts

2323521 without any hesitation he said that is a great idea
2323522 for many of these kids it was the first time they experienced this type of environment
2323523 we just wanted the freedom to make it whatever its going to be
2323524 i think the audience will really enjoy him letting loose like that
2323525 borat cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan
2323526 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
2323527 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision
2323528 theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
2323529 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
2323530 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit
2323531 you luckily have some hit movies and then you kind of go ok you want us to do another one
2323532 there was no talk of toning it down there was no intention of making a conventional movie in an attempt to reach a mass audience
2323533 we wouldnt have wanted to do something that didnt reflect the show and didnt respect the audiences investment in the show and what made it different and unique
2323534 do you remember the time we laughed so hard that we shook the feathers off our caps
2323535 we did have fun together didnt we we did have fun
2323536 wasnt it wonderful when we walked in the water in every state or almost every state
2323537 it was just yesterday that we walked and walked and i knew the name of every flower
2323538 i think people assume that if youre from the theater that youre going to sing with a certain kind of sound and its going to be overly emotional and have lots of vibrato pop music now has come to be the anti voice or something
2323539 i am the loudest witch in oz and no ones gonna turn my volume down
2323540 she was sort of my template for being able to come from the theater and still write original music
2323541 she kind of combines the worlds for me and gives me permission to say so what if i come from a broadway show
2323542 theyre all songs we wrote on the spot in the studio
2323543 maybe i had some lyrics in my journal or he had some chord progressions we just came in every day and started writing
2323544 its about taye and idina a black man with a white woman its about two lovers of the same sex its about loving who you want to love despite what anyone may think
2323545 i take them out of their element a little bit
2323546 i put them in a context that i feel fits with the sound of the rest of the evening
2323547 i get videotapes sent to me from kids singing the songs from the show at the dinner table its the cutest thing ever
2323548 i feel a real connection with some of these young girls
2323549 i think parents are grateful because its not a britney spears thing
2323550 its based on a green girl who ends up being powerful and strong and beautiful it is a nice symbol for young kids
2323551 i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time
2323552 theyre more interested in being provocative than telling a story thats going to resonate with the vast majority of tv viewers
2323553 the parents television council wont be satisfied with television content until they convince the government to enforce their personal selective judgments
2323554 parents arent competent enough to make television viewing decisions for their own families
2323555 seems to be actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light
2323556 heres the thing about monogamy it only works if you cheat
2323557 israels iron clad commitment to human rights you must be kidding
2323558 during the israeli occupation i was 100 times freer than under the palestinian authority
2323559 the only thing necessary for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing
2323560 after careful thought and consultation we have identified several pathways for the future which will enable us to continue to prosper
2323561 having regard to our present and future needs we have determined that these will be best served with new rabbinic leadership
2323562 bshc never sought out a rabbi for life nor was the role ever positioned in that way
2323563 was blocking the committee in moving the shul in the direction they wanted to go
2323564 every year the us state department publishes a report on the state of human rights and religious freedom in israel to our great sorrow you repeatedly every year report baseless claims regarding yad lachim you write that yad lachim harasses missionaries and uses violence against them these unfounded claims have no basis and are essentially nothing more than slander
2323565 we fear that the information you have published comes from interested parties among the missionary organizations and that you are giving them a stage for their libels without verifying the claims
2323566 whats outrageous is that instead of the state department contacting us for some kind of clarification they just printed it
2323567 if anything its the opposite its the missionaries who have been violent against us against our yad lachim activists and not the other way around
2323568 theres no significance on a practical level at this stage but were concerned weve been asked to come to america and set up shop there to help american jews fight missionaries were concerned that if the state department has us down as troublemakers they might get in the way of allowing us to set up operations there
2323569 the missionaries in israel are in a bind because theyre getting a massive amount of money from their supporters in america and around the world and they dont have much to show for it theyre working very very hard and yad lachim is succeeding every week in rescuing jews from their missions and they need an excuse if they can accuse us of violence thats the excuse that they need

2323575 we all share the cost when employers ignore taking care of their employees

2323581 for the mehtas this is a very difficult time and our heart goes out to them itll be everyones prayer that the child is born without any serious complications and grows up healthy if the baby is normal the mehtas must not be blamed for seeking abortion after all they approached the court on the basis of medical evidence that suggested a congenital heart block at least they had the courage and the honesty to take the legal route instead of aborting illegally the mehtas for their part must put the legal battle behind them and focus on whats ahead there have been cases where children have been born out of extremely complicated pregnancies and gone on to lead normal lives also advances in medical science bring new hope every day
2323582 in mothers to be with foetal abnormality have won legal battles for termination
2323583 the church stands against abortion people have a misconception that parents give life and hence they are supporting it we are willing to adopt the child and provide it with a good life

2323590 the elasticity of the new material enhances the mechanical resistance to bending
2323591 discovered for the first time in the world a combination of an ionic liquid and an elastic resin that is soluble in the liquid
2323592 it is highly likely that the long swnts play an important role in enhancing the conductivity and the elasticity
2323593 we assume that the swnts are tangled together like spaghetti and they are extended in that state we think this is why the conductivity does not change even when the material is stretched

2323617 a number of people assumed that when i left exeter i was also leaving the ministry and what unsettled me about that was on the one hand that it was not true i had every hope being as much a minister in the books i wrote as in the classes i taught and on the other hand that i would have to work very hard and carefully to make sure that it did not become true
2323618 arsenal played very well and out played us in spells
2323619 we were disappointed that we didnt keep the ball better when we had it the second half performance was not as good as the first in the first half we created a lot of opportunities and i think we need to build on that so next time we take our opportunities
2323620 we are in it to win it this season we have got as much chance as anybody else
2323621 we are definitely closing the gap and we have not taken any steps backwards obviously with it being pre season we cannot look into this result too much we are looking to the league now and hopefully pick up some points against arsenal
2323622 brenda i speak on behalf of your father my beloved brother that morty is garbage and it would be an honor to me to take him out
2323623 its our way of saying to them despite everything you do here are the voices of people you want to silence and they are speaking in the heart of beijing on the very first day of the olympics
2323624 the only way to balance the market is by choking off demand which would require a spike above 200
2323625 oil has been very cheap now its becoming rather expensive
2323626 everyone expected a normal market response to higher prices would be an expansion of production but that hasnt happened
2323627 cba stores probably carry the closest products to what wed like to send overseas theyre christ centered and christ honoring products and while kids in other countries definitely still need general hygiene products and school supplies whats really going to change their lives are the products sold within the cba stores
2323628 i used to think that because my mom and dad were christians i was already saved through the lessons i learned that i need to trust jesus as my savior and ive asked him to come into my heart

2323634 should show just a little decency in respecting their rules
2323635 american society has become entrapped in this filthy market and it is destroying our families

2323641 mick brown the chief scout at sunderland asked me to do some work for the club three or four months ago and im really enjoying it
2323642 ive been doing certain match reports at home but the majority of the time ive been working abroad watching a variety of champions league games and euro 2008 qualifiers as well as german dutch and french football so its been fantastic and a massive eye opener for me
2323643 after starting his career at shrewsbury town it was at sunderland that atkins really made a name for himself in top flight football he loved his time at roker park but still regrets the manner in which alan durbans talented team of the early eighties was broken up
2323644 i think that in the supporters eyes at that time it was potentially the best team that sunderland have ever had
2323645 i was 24 when i joined the club and became one of the most experienced players
2323646 sadly the board lost patience with alan durban but he had a lot of sorting out to do at the club and i thought everything he did was spot on and he was getting everything right
2323647 management is not an easy job especially at a club like sunderland because of expectations the potential of that side was lost in one swoop of impatience and then the club were relegated twice soon afterwards
2323648 we understand the need for the city to reduce traffic and limit the number of parking permits for schools
2323649 however we do not understand the urgency in which principals are being asked to provide this information principals need to consult and collaborate with staff that will be directly affected by this new policy
2323650 we are making accommodations for those principals who are away
2323651 they can let us know when school opens next month
2323652 i think we converted five third downs we got our running game going and hit some timely passes that was what we wanted
2323653 we feel good about what the first group did its something to build on we can still correct a lot of things that we didnt do right
2323654 i think we converted five third downs we got our running game going and hit some timely passes that was what we wanted
2323655 we feel good about what the first group did its something to build on we can still correct a lot of things that we didnt do right
2323656 the situation hasnt changed really from day one certainly not for the last five years
2323657 ive been saying at every agm every time ive done interviews that were looking for investment we always have done we always will be and that continues
2323658 i do look at the clubs that have the champions league status that brings in millions and have the multi multi multi millionaires and the billionaires in them and think thats probably what it takes now to get a hugely successful club
2323659 theres a part of me that hopes thats not true but if you look at that top four and the consistency of the top four theres a lot of money floating around it and we at everton do not have that money
2323660 a ground move is certainly crucial to the economic future of everton
2323661 ive said it a million times i love goodison park but we have to move
2323662 we have to get more income into the football club to begin to compete with those clubs weve been discussing
2323663 thats the reason weve been contemplating a move and the truth is weve had enormous support from knowsley enormous support from tesco and we havent from liverpool
2323664 that is one of the ones you can believe in the papers
2323665 he is one of the major targets but there are others who have not made the papers yet thankfully i just want to pull one off if i can just get one of the ones weve been after that will be a start
2323666 there are four or five or even six out there at the moment that we are daily if not hourly trying to catch
2323667 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
2323668 at everton we are determined to remain at the cutting edge of new media and the launch of this great new site in conjunction with the introduction of youreverton is a further demonstration of our commitment in that direction

2323670 i am glad that the agreement is now finalised and that i can concentrate on playing football for fulham
2323671 roy hodgson fulham boss has been great over the last week or so of on going discussions and his support in getting me here has only strengthened my ambition to give 100 per cent for him and the team every game
2323672 fulham is a club with a lot of history and ambition and im pleased that i can be part of that
2323673 itd be great if we can win the womens community shield begin the season with some silverware and start as we mean to go on
2323674 it is a massive game and it always is when we play arsenal we are confident that when we go into these games we can beat them and that has been something that we have lacked over the last few years
2323675 we want to make sure that winning the league cup against arsenal was not a one off
2323676 we want to build on that and the next progression is to consistently beat arsenal which is a tall order but it has to be our bench mark
2323677 i have made no secret of my wish to add andy johnson to my squad at fulham
2323678 we said then and were saying now that were continuing to explore opportunities to work with chrysler but we dont have anything to announce right now
2323679 edwards denied paying any money to hunter to keep her from going pubic
2323680 edwards made a point of saying that his wifes cancer was in remission when he began the affair with hunter elizabeth edwards has since been diagnosed with an incurable form of the disease
2323681 if you look at the consistency of the top four there is a lot of money floating around them and we at everton do not have that money
2323682 i do look at the clubs with the champions league status that brings in millions and have the multi multi multi millionaires and the billionaires in them
2323683 and i think that is probably what it takes now to get a hugely successful football club
2323684 theres a part of me that hopes thats not true of course there is and there always will be that feeling inside me
2323685 but if you look at that top four and the consistency of the top four there is a lot of money floating around them and we at everton do not have that money
2323686 it is a business for billionaires now and to break into that champions league status i think you need that sort of backing
2323687 a ground move is certainly crucial to the economic future of everton
2323688 ive said a million times that i love goodison park but we have to move for economic and financial reasons
2323689 we have to get more income into the club to begin to compete with those clubs ive been talking about
2323690 thats the reason we have been contemplating it and the truth is weve had enormous support from knowsley council and from tesco and weve not had that from liverpool council
2323691 thats the bottom line we need to increase the ground capacity to try to compete
2323692 this decision does not spell the end of the destination kirkby project
2323693 quite optimistic and im convinced he is going to carry on with us
2323694 he is a sporting player and thats it theres been plenty of rumours this summer and an offer was made but we rejected it because it wasnt interesting for the club
2323695 it is important to stress that this decision does not spell the end of the destination kirkby project but it will precipitate a period of reflection assessment and re evaluation
2323696 we are disappointed by the decision having spent more than two years working diligently on a project which would not only provide everton football club with a new home but also regenerate kirkby we had hoped to avoid a government call in
2323697 indeed it was only in june that knowsley borough councils planning committee voted by a majority of 20 1 to grant planning permission
2323698 we shall now engage in detailed discussions with our development partners kbc and tesco to assess what options are open to us
2323699 it is important to stress that this decision does not spell the end of the destination kirkby project but it will self evidently precipitate a period of reflection assessment and re evaluation

2323703 its amazing that at one point some of these ghost towns were teeming hilltops of people
2323704 its amazing what a century can do as far as depleting a resource and a population
2323705 whatever has been left behind for us to admire is there because nobody passing that way before has destroyed it
2323706 i wish that people had more respect for history lives were lived there to see these places wiped out is sad
2323707 i would try finding a town thats not on modern maps and id try to find out as much as i could about it i used a lot of early road maps from the 1920s and 30s i compared new maps with the old maps old mining areas are white on forest service maps from there i was able to pinpoint just when the town stopped getting recognition and was able to know when the town survived until
2323708 i moved out west from michigan in 1975 we stopped at the black hills area of south dakota on the way and found some former mining camps on the map we camped at these ghost towns ever since 1975 ive had the bug
2323709 i took the photos from 1985 1995 finally finishing up the book in 1999 during winters i would write the photo captions and historical information
2323710 wed go back to places we had been a year before and when wed get there some of the greatest buildings there were gone
2323711 ill bet that you wouldnt be able to find dozens of the buildings in this book or perhaps even entire towns anymore they wont be there anymore unfortunately
2323712 a lot of these old places are sitting on valuable property thats because in the past one place they didnt mine was under the towns but since nobody lives in these towns anymore its being done
2323713 you get goose bumps when you notice that something is missing and that you were able to be there before it disappeared youre glad that you got to see it but you feel sick too i consider the photos in my book a testimonial to the spirit and sense of historical importance most of us embrace as part of our past
2323714 granite is the most disappointing to watch i was there in 1977 when it had a full main street along with buildings on both sides of the streets five years later in the mid 1980s the change was quite drastic so much was gone
2323715 ive got leads on places i still need to go i hear that there was a mining town near bannack that was built on stilts i need to go and see if theres anything left

2323728 the monetary policy committee will likely stand pat for the remainder of the year as the tug of war between slower growth and mounting price pressures continues
2323729 we expect rates to be lowered next year as inflation comes off its peak and the economy struggles to find its feet
2323730 this proves that people confronted with stereotypes generally behave in line with them
2323731 in this case blondes have the potential to make people act in a dumber way because they mimic the unconscious stereotype of the dumb blonde
2323732 ive always been taken very seriously i have always been blonde and i have never had an issue with the way i am if im being insulted then im blissfully unaware

2323740 remember that our lives on this planet are too short and the work to be done too great that those who live with us are our brothers and sisters that they share with us the same short moment of life that they want like us to live that life in happiness and fulfilment
2323741 your commie has no regard for human life not even his own and for this reason men i want to impress upon you the need for extreme watchfulness
2323742 surely human affairs would be far happier if the power in men to be silent were the same as that to speak but experience more than sufficiently teaches that men govern nothing with more difficulty than their tongues
2323743 really i think that the poorest he that is in england has a life to live as the greatest he and therefore truly sir i think its clear that every man that is to live under a government ought first by his own consent to put himself under that government and i do think that the poorest man in england is not at all bound in a strict sense to that government that he has not had a voice to put himself under

2323773 once powers have been transferred ministers engage in a charade of pretence that they still retain those powers even when introducing measures that they are obliged to bring in as a result of an eu directive they behave as though the initiative were their own indeed ministers often end up nobly accepting responsibility for laws that they actually opposed when they were being negotiated in brussels they took the rap for costly and troublesome home improvement packs which have added to the woes of the housing market even though they were actually mandated by a brussels directive similarly they took the rap for fortnightly bin collections hospital reconfiguration and a number of other measures even though they had all been triggered by directives from brussels

2323815 ive dealt with 21 years of challenges now its time for the people in charge to decide
2323816 timi is largely responsible for the reps artistic dna says rep managing director nick nichols
2323817 the way that we approach the art the importance we put on supporting nurturing and valuing all our artists is just the way we work and that attitude and approach is timis
2323818 change is easy to say and hard to do near says
2323819 san jose rep is a theater in the midst of rebuilding itself and it is wide open to change it is an exciting time for someone to come in and shape the rep to their artistic vision
2323820 you have to be tenacious your primary goal is what goes on stage yes youve got to work with the managing director and youve got to balance the budget but you have to keep your eyes on the prize thats the job
2323821 vanya in which a family steeps in its own regrets wistfully pondering what might have been echo keenly with near at this stage in the drama of her life
2323822 that sounds new age y but youve got to be true to yourself in life so that when you look back on what you did years later you dont have any regrets you have to look for fulfillment

2323824 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
2323825 changes california constitution to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry
2323826 throw the legitimacy of the election into question because it is so one sided
2323827 election ballot titles should be neutral and not intentionally prejudice voters
2323828 its a rare and drastic step invoking the constitutional amendment process to strip people of rights yet in california it can be done with a simple majority vote
2323829 the way were going to improve this situation is by education not only in latin america but here
2323830 when we build the academies we have to continue to invest in education
2323831 those leagues get started later obviously we push aggressively to do some testing that can lead to bunching of results depending on whats going on in the lab
2323832 there are particular challenges associated with testing of players from the dominican and venezuela and efforts should be made to meet to meet those challenges
2323833 from the unions perspective all should keep in mind the principal purpose of drug testing is deterrence
2323834 the assumption that nowadays women are weaker than they were in the past is not necessary so and the medical logic says that in light of the nutrition and medicine that we live with today the situation is exactly the opposite
2323835 as each case is examined specifically we mustnt be too strict because this is a fast prescribed by the rabbis
2323836 generally speaking those pregnant or breastfeeding are eligible of participating in the memory of the temples destruction and on this day of fasting
2323837 every rabbi and dayan should witness this once in their lifetime
2323838 i know ppl in your community will follow their rabbis advice and i respect that but no one should say that it doesnt affect the baby after every major fast day im in the hospital with women watching the lines on the monitors go from flat to wavy after we give them fluids your body is sustaining two circulatory systems you fast and the baby fasts too thats the bottom line
2323839 its a clear cut shilchon urech that pregnant woman and up to 30 days after birth should not fast no exceptions
2323840 my rav told me what to do id rather have fasted it was a miserable day couldnt go to shul except for yizkor the rest of the time i was drinking minute drinks of water every 9 minutes i was awash with liquid never again

2323848 sometimes it might get portrayed as one way when that might not be the case i guess when everything is done and over with then you could possibly talk about it it depends on how everything goes
2323849 i dont know about that i do think she was here before you
2323850 you know maam it will only take a moment extra and ill be with you shortly

2323879 debates between mormons and evangelicals have been a common thing and you can certainly draw a crowd when you have that kind of an event because people want to see the fists fly
2323880 bridging the divide the continuing conversation between a mormon and an evangelical
2323881 my life is floating in a sea of tranquility my body is the boat my mind the sail and my soul the water

2323885 tom lantos and henry j hyde united states global leadership against hiv aids tuberculosis and malaria reauthorization act of 2008
2323886 this is really bad policy it calls into question whether folks care about prevention or not
2323887 we would have had a good bill had global aids alliance and the one campaign not intervened
2323888 we did the best we could to fit changes with sex workers and prevention
2323889 it wouldnt fly we perhaps would have gotten a party line voted bill out of the house but it wouldnt have made it through the senate
2323890 we all need to work a lot harder and a lot smarter and make common cause with religious groups
2323891 thats just a political necessity whether we like it or not its not like in the case of the travel ban when its largely recognized as something thats antiquated i dont think when it comes to prostitution that were there yet
2323892 it can be explained by the fact that the business environment is relatively simple in the us market which is covered by wal mart stores inc and other huge volume retailers
2323893 compared with the us market european markets are difficult as we must prepare measures in accordance with the commercial customs of each country
2323894 we will aim to strengthen our ties with leading volume retailers to expand our business in europe from now on
2323895 it is difficult to continue both lcd and crt tv businesses i doubt if we will still allot our management resources to crt tvs five years from now
2323896 in one to two years or three years at the most
2323897 the market still consists of a small number of manufacturers having successfully joined the frontrunners significantly helped with breaking even
2323898 desperate to avoid the merits of clemenss claims mcnamee moves to dismiss on insubstantial and frivolous grounds that are contrary to controlling authority which requires mcnamee to answer to a texas court and jury for his intentional conduct that injured a texas resident in texas
2323899 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in new york city for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
2323900 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked

2323907 lets face it china doesnt have a very good record on human rights its very troubling when you dont hear from someone in 24 hours
2323908 we call on china to use the opportunity of the olympics to demonstrate greater openness and tolerance and to respect the fundamental and universally recognized right of all people to peacefully express their views
2323909 im here to represent my country to the fullest and im here to be an ambassador for my country
2323910 i need to send the message as an athlete from sudan im worried about the kids who are dying in darfur

2323922 todays volatile markets and increasingly strict regulatory environments make this an opportune time to add dcgs capabilities to our trm practice

2323936 im not surprised that horatio nelson has been voted britains greatest ever military hero
2323937 nelson was a brilliant naval commander and a charismatic leader who won a series of battles against britains enemies culminating in the decisive british victory over a combined french and spanish fleet at the battle of trafalgar on 21st october 1805 tragically dying from his wounds at the moment of victory trafalgar put an end to napoleons plans for the invasion of britain and ensured british dominance of the worlds oceans for the rest of the 19th century it is right and proper that nelson is still so admired by people in britain today
2323938 limited tickets single seat obstructed view and standing room only remain for all four games of the nationals series

2323942 the guy has kind of a tiger woods mentality he worries about things he can control not things he cant
2323943 hes really good with that kind of thing he really competes against himself every day hes very professional youll never see any kind of outward emotion from him he knows the world of pro football and the hard cold facts of what goes on but hes concerned about what tarvaris jackson does
2323944 refutation of the system of malebranche concerning nature and grace
2323945 the human soul is still rational but in such a manner that being by the punishment of sin detained in the bonds of death it is so far reduced that it can only endeavour to arrive at the knowledge of things invisible through the visible
2323946 he was in the world and the world was made by him and nevertheless the world did not know him
2323947 by seeing every day the same things the mind grows familiar with them as well as the eyes it neither admires nor inquires into the causes of effects that are ever seen to happen in the same manner as if it were the novelty and not the importance of the thing itself that should excite us to such an inquiry
2323948 sure there have been men here formerly i perceive the workmanship of a skilful statuary i admire with what niceness he has proportioned all the limbs of this body in order to give them so much beauty gracefulness majesty life tenderness motion and action
2323949 thats your mistake a statuary never carved that figure it is made i confess with an excellent gusto and according to the rules of perfection but yet it is chance alone made it among so many pieces of marble there was one that formed itself of its own accord in this manner the rains and winds have loosened it from the mountains a violent storm has thrown it plumb upright on this pedestal which had prepared itself to support it in this place it is a perfect apollo like that of belvedere a venus that equals that of the medicis an hercules like that of farnese you would think it is true that this figure walks lives thinks and is just going to speak but however it is not in the least beholden to art and it is only a blind stroke of chance that has thus so well finished and placed it
2323950 let every star haste to go whither the lord sends it and when he speaks let them answer with trembling here we are
2323951 of what nature are those souls entirely different from and united to bodies
2323952 that those sparks of the divine spirit were the principle of all generations that animals received them in their conception and at their birth and that the moment they died those divine particles disengaged themselves from all terrestrial matter in order to fly up to heaven where they shone and rolled among the stars
2323953 esse apibus partem divin mentis et haustus therios dixere deum namque ire per omnes terrasque tractusque maris c lumque profundum hinc pecudes armenta viros genus omne ferarum quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas scilicet huc reddi deinde ac resoluta referriomnia nec morti esse locum sed viva volare sideris in numerum atque alto succedere c lo
2323954 induced by such examples some have taught that bees have portions of ethereal thought endued with particles of heavenly fires for god the whole created mass inspires through heaven and earth and ocean depth he throwshis influence round and kindles as he goes hence flocks and herds and men and beasts and fowls with breath are quickened and attract their souls hence take the forms his prescience did ordain and into him at length resolve again no room is left for death they mount the sky and to their own congenial planets fly
2323955 cannot be living but by our souls but our souls animate them far more easily than they can know them the soul knows not the body which is subject to it it does not know why it does not move the nerves but when it pleases and why on the contrary the pulsation of veins goes on without interruption whether the mind will or no it knows not which is the first part of the body it moves immediately in order thereby to move all the rest it does not know why it feels in spite of itself and moves the members only when it pleases it is the mind does these things in the body but how comes it to pass it neither knows what she does nor in what manner it performs it those who learn anatomy
2323956 are taught by others what passes within and is performed by themselves why
2323957 do i know without being taught that there is in the sky at a prodigious distance from me a sun and stars and why have i occasion for a master to learn where motion begins when i move my finger i know not how what i perform within myself is performed we are too far above and cannot comprehend ourselves
2323958 what i was when i had the thoughts i cannot find again i know not
2323959 either how it comes to pass that i am thus withdrawn from and deprived of myself or how i am afterwards brought back and restored to myself i am as it were another man and carried to another place when i look for and do not find what i had trusted to my memory in such a case we cannot reach and are in a manner strangers remote from ourselves nor do we come at us but when we find what we are in quest of but where is it we look for but within us or what is it we look for but ourselves so unfathomable a difficulty astonishes us
2323960 works both to will and to do of his good pleasure
2323961 is for mans use it is true but you have no reason to infer from thence that it was made with art and on purpose for the use of man a man must be ingenious in deceiving himself who looks for and thinks to find what never existed
2323962 that mans industry makes use of an infinite number of things that nature affords and are convenient for him but nature did not make those things on purpose for his conveniency as for instance some country fellows climb up daily by certain craggy and pointed rocks to the top of a mountain but yet it does not follow that those points of rocks were cut with art like a staircase for the conveniency of men in like manner when a man happens to be in the fields during a stormy rain and fortunately meets with a cave he uses it as he would do a house for shelter but however it cannot be affirmed that this cave was made on purpose to serve men for a house it is the same with the whole world it was formed by chance and without design but men finding it as it is had the art to turn and improve it to their own uses thus the art you admire both in the work and its artificer is only in men who know how to make use of everything that surrounds them
2323963 you are ingenious in deceiving yourself it is true this house is pleasant agreeable proportioned and commodious but yet it made itself with all its proportions chance put together all the stones in this excellent order it raised the walls jointed and laid the timber work cut open the casements and placed the staircase do not believe any human hand had anything to do with it men only made the best of this piece of work when they found it ready made they fancy it was made for them because they observe things in it which they know how to improve to their own conveniency but all they ascribe to the design and contrivance of an imaginary architect is but the effect of their preposterous imaginations this so regular and so well contrived house was made in just the same manner as a cave and men finding it ready made to their hands made use of it as they would in a storm of a cave they should find under a rock in a desert
2323964 the atoms will they say have an eternal motion their fortuitous concourse must in that eternity have already produced infinite combinations
2323965 an example will suffice to illustrate this i suppose an infinite number of combinations of the letters of the alphabet successively formed by chance all possible combinations are undoubtedly comprehended in that total which is truely infinite now it is certain that homers iliad is but a combination of letters therefore homers iliad is comprehended in that infinite collection of combinations of the characters of the alphabet this being laid down as a principle a man who will assign art in the iliad will argue wrong he may extol the harmony of the verses the justness and magnificence of the expressions the simplicity and liveliness of images the due proportion of the parts of the poem its perfect unity and inimitable conduct he may object that chance can never make anything so perfect and that the utmost effort of human wit is hardly capable to finish so excellent a piece of work yet all in vain for all this specious reasoning is visibly false it is certain on the contrary that the fortuitous concourse of characters putting them together by turns with an infinite variety the precise combination that composes the iliad must have happened in its turn somewhat sooner or somewhat later it has happened at last and thus the iliad is perfect without the help of any human art
2323966 perhaps one of the infinite combinations of atoms which chance has successively made has formed all these compositions in this desert island without the help of any mans art
2323967 as much as the heavens are above the earth as much
2323968 this is what it might have had what it has not
2323969 this picture is not absolutely perfect therefore it is only a collection of colours formed by chance nor did the hand of any painter meddle with it
2323970 are required to observe the wonderful order and design of the structure of the world how much more were necessary to form it
2323971 hi my name is xxxxxx an i am a doctor
2323972 no hitter says oh good we have a sinkerballer coming in
2323973 this guys a groundball pitcher hes durable hes been very successful in the postseason and ive heard hes a great guy
2323974 he doesnt give up home runs very often he gives up singles doesnt walk people
2323975 ive just been on standby the last couple of days
2323976 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2323977 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2323978 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2323979 you see teams go out in free agency and spend on a lot of guys and everyone says oh theyre going to be great and go to the super bowl it takes chemistry and to me thats the most important thing you can have all the talent in the world but if the chemistry is not there it wont matter
2323980 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2323981 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2323982 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2323983 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2323984 he still has the utmost amount of respect from the guys in this locker room here and we wish him well wish him a good season and hope to see him in tampa
2323985 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2323986 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2323987 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2323988 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2323989 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2323990 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2323991 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2323992 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2323993 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2323994 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2323995 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2323996 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2323997 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2323998 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2323999 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2324000 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2324001 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2324002 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2324003 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2324004 the thing that wouldve happened potentially is a quarterback competition that was kind of the worst option i guess you could say which wasnt even a bad option at all
2324005 they told me i was the starter back in march and i worked hard to figure out ways to exert my leadership on this team get to know guys a little more
2324006 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation
2324007 hes got good football intelligence and hes one rookie that came in and is not intimidated a lot of those guys get saucer eyes you line up against jason taylor and probably want to get his autograph hes really come along in camp
2324008 and on the o line i think its hard to break into the crusty group hes done a really nice job earning their respect
2324009 practices here are a lot more team orientated and you dont get to work on technique a lot
2324010 i noticed when i wasnt doing anything extra my technique started to falter a little bit so i just need to keep working on it
2324011 i kind of like it out here its a little ways away from the city
2324012 im still playing football i take the same approach as i did to college i just go out every day and try to get better
2324013 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2324014 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2324015 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2324016 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got
2324017 ive just always thought winning a gold medal would mean more than being a world champion or winning all that money or anything
2324018 performing his duties under fire without regard to his personal safety
2324019 i reacted just as i had been trained said parker
2324020 were constantly preparing for these situations and when it came down to it my muscle memory kicked in
2324021 petty officer parker is an example of why we train our navy combat cameramen who serve in hostile environments throughout the world
2324022 we do this so that were able to perform our job on any platform at sea in the desert in the snow on rocky terrains even in the air
2324023 not since the vietnam era have combat cameramen been able to deploy with special forces units in combat situations
2324024 i feel my entire career has been spent preparing for this one deployment and im proud to have been able to document the actions of these units and assist them wherever i could
2324025 when i wake up in the morning and look in the mirror this is my challenge
2324026 i want to win on a road course and its the last chance i have this year to do it thats what it really boils down to
2324027 i just want more laps to get in the rhythm of road course racing i seem to have the pace for a handful of laps doing the right thing
2324028 im not sure if its being overaggressive what that really is i keep searching for it i cant find that half a tenth i just need more seat time
2324029 we qualified well at sonoma and we led at the beginning but we didnt race in traffic like we wanted to
2324030 this race here is very important for the points but its more of a personal challenge for myself and crew chief chad knaus its a race that were looking at to help us down the road we want to get out of here with a decent finish
2324031 every great driver wants to feel like they can win at every track they go to
2324032 jimmie is an awesome driver he proves it every weekend hes in the same equipment that im in so i can appreciate it moreso than a lot of people can
2324033 road courses are not easy to win on i feel like theyve had some opportunities to win and they havent worked out hes been getting better and better when we go test hes usually faster than me i feel like its just a matter of time more than anything
2324034 the crazy thing is i do better in these other vehicles than i do in the cup car i just have to figure out how
2324035 it just shows how hard it is to stay on top weve put a lot of hard work in and have established ourselves as a contender
2324036 i never thought i would win at richmond and finally conquered that track it would be extremely satisfying to win at watkins glen
2324037 as much as we can talk about what our cars are doing and what were looking for in setups we do all that we can there
2324038 but when you get in the car and youre looking for a half a tenth of a second per corner and it totals up to a three or four tenths advantage from start to finish of a lap its really tough to communicate those things
2324039 its such a small difference its just a little everywhere i just need to do it more
2324040 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2324041 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2324042 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
2324043 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field mike tannenbaum and his football administration staff did a great job of navigating this complex process i am excited about welcoming brett deanna and their family to the jets organization
2324044 hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
2324045 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
2324046 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
2324047 just how he was doing where he was with the process things like that
2324048 the players want resolution they want what everybody wants to come out here every day and talk about somebody that is not here and then shows up its gone on too long and understandably so they want to play football
2324049 he got himself into a good count got a pitch he could hit and hammered it both times
2324050 he did a fantastic job for us especially in this ballpark with their lineup
2324051 he kept the ball down he kept it out of the middle of the plate and his curveball was extremely effective
2324052 i thought i was throwing my fastball down pretty consistently and got some groundball outs
2324053 the fifth and sixth inning i was leaving some balls up
2324054 bottom line they werent good pitches and they made me pay
2324055 six southern african countries that recorded 60 000 measles cases in 1996 reduced this to 117 cases in 2000
2324056 it cost the united states us 124 million a year to keep itself free of smallpox for the twenty five years prior to when smallpox was eradicated in 1978 thus the us 32 million that the united states invested in the global smallpox eradication program was recouped in about three months once smallpox vaccinations could be discontinued

2324071 john doe has always said i was the most reliable creative problem solver hed ever met
2324072 im perhaps too committed to my work and dont spend enough time with my family
2324073 i think im too good at my job it can often make people jealous
2324074 ive been told i occasionally focus on details and miss the bigger picture so ive been spending time laying out the complete project every day to see my overall progress
2324075 well thats something ive thought long and hard about and i think someone with my experience should get between x amp y
2324076 right now im more interested in talking more about what the position can offer my career
2324077 ive always got on just fine with my co workers actually

2324086 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2324087 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2324088 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2324089 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2324090 im not going to blame one side or the other a lot of things happened this season a lot of shocking things but at this point its irrelevant
2324091 theres no ill feelings he has a positive reputation within this organization
2324092 i hope i can play at the level that ive always played at
2324093 theres no guarantees there have never been any guarantees for me its football and anything can happen
2324094 i always wanted to be a packer and i think i always will be a packer
2324095 im not a traitor never will be its business its the way it works i gave everything i could possibly give i hope the jets fans see the same thing
2324096 i havent played in new york im a south mississippi boy but i know how tough the city can be and i know how great it can be
2324097 it can be as good as you want to make it
2324098 with everyone from drudge to leno to wonkette riffing on a tale that began trickling out at christmas the mainstream press look foolish by remaining silent
2324099 now that the charges are festering on the web on talk radio and around the watercooler mainstream journalists owe their readers their best professional efforts to sort fact from innuendo
2324100 were trying to spend as little as possible and looking for good deals on everything
2324101 i see a lot of stuff that would be nice to have but i dont really need
2324102 its different times now and everyone is buying only what is needed
2324103 the result is that its going to take kids out of their favorite stores and move them into the stores their parents want them to shop in
2324104 youre going to see students buying in stores that arent their first choice
2324105 and with freshmen especially youll get parents saying ill let you pick out the computer you want but not the clothes
2324106 spend 100 and get the next 30 in purchases for free
2324107 the design of what we offer is whats attracting the college customer and the affordability of the products is very appealing too
2324108 they want to feel like theyre making their own choices based on their personal sense of style
2324109 we understand that its an important part of our business but we think that one of the things that appeals to a young customer is when you dont market to them
2324110 its fantastic far better than any business class ive seen in a 747
2324111 right down to the picture quality on the big tv screen
2324112 and they dont know anything about us being on this flight were just going to walk into their hotel and surprise them theyll be so jealous
2324113 you could argue its a bit hot but its the best flight ive ever had
2324114 absolutely all the money goes to charity so its ending up in the right place and this flight really is a piece of history the first outing for the biggest plane ever built
2324115 perhaps not for quite so much money but yes the standard is something you wont find elsewhere im very impressed by their wine list would you care for a glass
2324116 theyre all dead jealous that im on the first flight
2324117 doctors and scientists adjudicate on such matters all the time
2324118 we had a bit of a run at it last year the top four but we couldnt quite make it
2324119 well have another shot at it this year as will a few other clubs but it will be difficult
2324120 i think a lot of clubs have made a bit of a statement with some of the signings the likes of tottenham and portsmouth have made some good additions
2324121 aston villa have such a young squad and theyll probably improve year on year
2324122 ive played against psv a few times before it didnt go so well with ajax so i hope this time it will
2324123 theyve got a good team with quality players and theyre a passing team that likes to keep the ball for fun its going to be a good test for us
2324124 the dutch league is still strong and getting stronger ive been away from holland for two years now and psv are still setting the standard it shows because theyve won the league four times in a row
2324125 when youre together for 10 days you get to understand the people not just on the field but off it too its good for the team
2324126 nothing has changed here since our last game of last season and were all looking forward to the new season
2324127 we have done well in the couple of tournaments we have played in
2324128 the winning is not massively important at this time of the season but we are still happy to win as winning breeds winning and hopefully we will carry that on into the season
2324129 the squad have worked really hard since the summer break they have responded well look fit and are ready to go
2324130 the community shield is something we want to win because we want to win trophies and build on from last season
2324131 with the game being in the north west we encourage evertonians to come out and support us it would be a massive boost for the girls

2324136 but i am constantly at risk of going to jail for it
2324137 im not a rubber stamp and there are too many rubber stamps in congress these days
2324138 people just want to follow whatever their party leadership tells them

2324147 luce simbolica sui diritti umani loro rispetto precondizione per ospitare eventi internazionali
2324148 attraverso le olimpiadi ha spiegato il presidente manfredi palmeri dando seguito alla mozione approvata dallaula lo scorso 24 luglio abbiamo lopportunit di accendere la luce sul rispetto dei diritti delluomo in ogni parte del mondo si tratta di valori universali di civilt che non possono e non devono vedere contrapposti tibet e cina tibetani e cinesi due popoli amici di milano
2324149 abbiamo reso compatibile la volont unanime del consiglio comunale con la legge italiana ha detto il presidente palmeri spiegando la scelta dellurban center come luogo dellesposizione che prevede possano essere affisse sugli edifici pubblici solo le bandiere del comune della nostra nazione e dellunione europea o quelle di altri stati solo in occasione di visite ufficiali delle autorit estere
2324150 perch la nostra pallavolista taismary aguero esiliata politica possa rientrare a pechino e poi in italia per proseguire le proprie esperienze agonistiche e umane
2324151 il rispetto dei diritti civili fondamentali dovrebbe essere la precondizione per ospitare grandi eventi internazionali in particolare sportivi da questo punto di vista andrebbe fatta in futuro una verifica preventiva in tutti i paesi candidati
2324152 milano ha spiegato il consigliere maurizio baruffi primo firmatario della mozione annunciando anche una manifestazione in programma domani ad assisi vuole tenere alta lattenzione sul tema dei diritti umani e civili sia in tibet sia in cina nello spirito di fratellanza che proprio delle parole del dalai lama
2324153 si tratta di un gesto simbolico piccolo ma significativo ha detto il consigliere carlo fidanza commentando lesposizione della bandiera tibetana proprio perch frutto della volont unanime di tutte le forze politiche milanesi rispetto alle olimpiadi di pechino di fronte alle quali la comunit internazionale avrebbe potuto dimostrare forse pi coraggio

2324155 lespressione artistica sempre e comunque un double del proprio io o meglio dellidentit interiore dellartista che appunto attraverso laltro da s cio lo specifico linguistico scelto restituisce un autoritratto psicologico simbolico alla stessa stregua dellidentit fisionomica che pur trasformandosi col trascorrere del tempo dalla nascita alla maturit ed oltre rimane sempre la stessa altrettanto avviene nella produzione di ogni artista la quale nel tempo mantiene costanti i tratti connotativi di base ci mi ha portato ad asserire che ciascun artista per tutta la vita mutatis mutandis fa sempre la stessa opera anna seccia non sfugge alla regola
2324156 but your australian birds oh my god ive never seen or heard anything like them i mean look at that thing
2324157 just in case you never knew i cant be the lighter of your eternal flame
2324158 no i cant stain your white lace baby not even you can stain your white lace baby
2324159 we had a really special thing both of us felt safe for the first time ever and you start to open up with someone when you feel safe thats where we were at when it happened
2324160 but thats the way things happened id never experienced a death close to me before a part of me definitely died with him but another part was opened up
2324161 it took a long time and there was so much chaos after he died for me but hopefully you learn you learn
2324162 at that stage antony was really obsessed with playing soft i learnt a lot from that antony is so supportive a lot can happen through his guidance hes always holding you even if hes not near you
2324163 you learn that family is about the people you grew up with the people who stand by you the people who love you unconditionally
2324164 we all knew she her mother was going to go
2324165 it was just a matter of when i mean were all gonna go but when you know there is a lot less time it makes you appreciate the time you have left i tried to take advantage of talking to her a lot and sharing her memories
2324166 i think the older you get the more you find that people around you are dying
2324167 you can feel very depressed about that or you can really grasp it and be reminded that theres a time limit for you too because it does go fast incredibly fast unbelievably fast i really hope that feeling is on the new record
2324168 and the hopefulness that remains because you are lucky enough to be here
2324169 i mean mentally alive when you are on tour for so long you can start to feel like a ghost
2324170 i wrote that for us to sing because rufus and i were in similar positions in our lives
2324171 we feel the same way about our country and we were also dealing with similar personal situations with both our mums with cancer the bulk of that song the verses are about letting go and allowing what happens to happen even if its extremely painful
2324172 the song works pretty well on all those levels i think and rufus is a great singer he doesnt sound too shabby our rufus not too shabby at all
2324173 a lot of troubling things were going on and i did make it through yes there was a personal relationship that i am not dealing with any longer i am thankful to say
2324174 but you know music is a place where i can go to feel
2324175 ive got so much from music in my life and i feel responsible about giving back to it
2324176 im on a path of trying to be more honest and that includes being more vulnerable because i think that is the place of power its not like ive arrived or anything its an ongoing process but when you can say this is where my weakness lies its not your point of weakness any more its the way to personal freedom
2324177 we just felt that song represented the album the best
2324178 we werent foolish we knew if we came to the label and suggested that song as a single then there would be editing so there are two versions the album version and the radio edit which is about four minutes long and starts when the singing starts
2324179 i knew i was going to use it for something and then i started making a bed of drones and writing around that i have a feeling that will be one of the more polarising tracks on the album
2324180 i think that people can be incredibly in love with their partners and still find themselves in their darker moments asking larger questions
2324181 if people go through their life unsure of their own position it seems to make sense that they would be even more unsure of their relationships to other people i dont write these songs to be some sort of confession and i dont think theres any despair or even overt sadness these are the thoughts that go through everybodys head i think
2324182 we are shocked by this terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to ingrid riveras family and friends we are grateful to the new york police department for arresting a suspect in this crime we continue to cooperate with police and answer any questions they may have
2324183 its fascinating to go into their heads and see how stories get made people have an insatiable hunger for stories it seems
2324184 i never ever thought of it as about anybody famous
2324185 i thought it was equally about the four characters in the film and about friendship and love and passion and what happens when the borders between friendship and love are crossed and when jealousy enters into it that dylan thomas happens to be one of the four was a gift not a necessary part of it
2324186 im quite sure that in selling the story it would not have been attractive to investors had dylan thomas and caitlin thomas not been two of the four but it was the themes of it that interested me
2324187 a man who could talk any woman he liked into bed and a mischievous man a man who had the gift of the gab and who wasnt afraid to say anything that came into his head
2324188 i think were fascinated by whats the spark what is it that turned them from relatively ordinary into genius
2324189 becoming jane is about what turned her into the writer she was
2324190 there were dramatic elements to their lives that made them cinema worthy
2324191 somebody like philip larkin did nothing exceptional except write this small body of exquisite poems which made him a very famous poet other than the fact he was a misogynist and had weird affairs theres probably not much of a movie there but johnny depp was a poet in the libertine who was also a debonair 17th century swinger which is what made that movie interesting
2324192 the life story of the writer has to be really vivid or exciting or interesting to justify a film treatment of their life
2324193 its not enough just to have written a couple of good books
2324194 i relished the challenge of trying to find a way of giving the audience access to that side of her in an entertaining way that didnt disrupt the story
2324195 writing has to be the most cinematically boring aspect of a writers life so i tried to avoid that as much as possible unless you can see the words flashing across the forehead of the writer or something there are very few ways of representing it cinematically
2324196 its as if my quill is broken as if the organ of my imagination has dried up as if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed
2324197 i knew he was broke he was horny and he was starved for an idea
2324198 if shakespeare was alive today hed have a three picture deal with warner bros hed be living in bel air and hed be driving a porsche

2324226 the stadium is beautiful and there is a great quote one world one dream which is what the olympics is all about
2324227 holland are a very strong team along with brazil and argentina and they have quality big name players but on the day of a game big names do not matter its teamwork and anything can happen
2324228 i am not sure if i will feature in the game because we had a training session and when i went to shoot i felt a sharp pain in my left knee
2324229 when i try to sprint its painful but i have been getting treatment to give myself the best chance its a lot better than when i first did it and i can jog now so hopefully i can feature in the game
2324230 its really frustrating but if i dont feature i will be there cheering the team on
2324231 we trained at the stadium on tuesday and although the pitch is not that good the stadium is nice
2324232 i was just looking up at the flags of all the countries that are participating and i remembered watching the olympics when i was young its been a dream of mine and of many others to be here

2324240 but i saw warmth in his eyes so we walked over to him
2324241 his few words nearly took our breath away because genas fathers name was also alan and he also had a very similar gentle and kind demeanor but her father had passed away six months earlier and still is missed so dearly
2324242 i dont think its a coincidence today that santa cruz means holy cross in spanish

2324251 as an educator i really emphasize the importance that you have to teach them or theyre not going to know what to do

2324305 theres no disputing what this measure does first and foremost what it does is eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry in the state of california
2324306 we believe the attorney general has attempted to influence voters against this measure
2324307 it is our goal to ensure that voters have a fair opportunity to decide this measure for themselves on election day
2324308 these guys are good enough to go out there and get a medal and compete with anyone else in the world
2324309 theyre going to show the heart of america here in beijing
2324310 the expectations stay the same the vision doesnt change at all we still feel were medal contenders
2324311 weve had a very strong group of guys who have worked really hard the last three years
2324312 youre going to see a lot of determination when they hit the floor
2324313 they started to treat the team in a very positive manner like the u s style
2324314 if chinas team has a good competition i think the gold medal
2324315 this has been an extremely hard decision for me to make ive given everything i can to be ready to compete at this olympic games
2324316 its best for me to step down and have another athlete fill my position this is something for me thats very tough because its end of my career and its not the way i had planned it
2324317 he expressed some concerns about his ability to continue at that point we wanted to have the medical staff take another look at it and see what we could do for him explore all the options but at the same time we needed to know thursday whether he was going to be able to do the events or not
2324318 the doctors were looking at anything that could give him some relief immediate relief
2324319 but again the timing we had to deal with in terms of whether he was going to be able to physically participate and the timing of replacing him if he wasnt meant that we really had to make a decision today he was aware of that
2324320 the expectations stay the same the vision doesnt change at all we still feel were medal contenders
2324321 but its something that is to the point where my ankle is shutting down and its not responding to what im telling it do to as a result i cant do my gymnastics especially not safely

2324327 now we have to go against holland then nigeria i couldnt be happier the guys couldnt be happier peter nowak the coach couldnt be happier
2324328 we created a lot of chances and we were dangerous in the final third
2324329 we did have some good cooperation but we made mistakes

2324334 but we would not want it any other way we won both conference championships last year and then the wheels came off two weeks later at the ncaa championships we walked away thinking it was cus worst finish in 15 years
2324335 to say we can win the national championship is unrealistic
2324336 but to get to the final four or the elite eight when you get to that point anything can happen i feel were at that point
2324337 if we play quality competition at the beginning of the season and win thats huge

2324359 if all the national squads will lose players if clubs force them to return home we simply will not have an olympic football tournament here in beijing
2324360 we could do beach soccer or a five a side tournament that would be very sad and the world would not understand it
2324361 we cannot have players who have been entered in the football tournament in accordance with all the rules we cant let them go we cant see them return home
2324362 its really sad to see such a decision was handed down putting in danger the entire football tournament
2324363 after the games we will take stock of the olympic football tournament and decide on what measures to take
2324364 in the meantime we have to manage it in the short term and appeal to the clubs not to withdraw players and allow players who are entered in the football tournament to put their dreams into reality
2324365 i would like to appeal to the clubs plead with them to respect this dream please observe an olympic truce for this olympic football tournament
2324366 the european market has been growing year by year and its certainly been a hope of ours that it would become a viable alternative for players
2324367 the luxury tax in the nba has put a crimp on what teams can spend so players are looking for alternatives
2324368 in fact we see this as a positive indication of how popular the sport of basketball is on a global basis
2324369 italy greece russia 40 million a year yeah im there as simple as that
2324370 if it happens it happens id be surprised if it did with players of that caliber
2324371 but certainly we would deal with it if it happened and i continue to think that the nba will be the gold standard for the top players in the world for a long time to come
2324372 it just shows you what a global game basketball is that there are good leagues and leagues that are willing to pay for high caliber talent
2324373 the more money they get the better they feel about the commitment
2324374 without there being a players association and a collective bargaining agreement in europe theres nothing behind the contract to enforce them other than to go to court
2324375 for europe to truly get to the point where they can compete with the nba for all kinds of players theyre going to have to implement a system where theres a lot more comfort that the contracts are truly guaranteed once that happens then i think youll truly see great competition for players
2324376 we could have came to an agreement last year so i think thats the window of opportunity for a lot of teams

2324414 the inventory level in the channel and among pc oems has increased compared to the q2 global economic conditions are adding more uncertainty on the demand side of the equation
2324415 the higher than anticipated increase in unit shipments in the q2 signals that excess inventory is being shifted from the dram suppliers to the buyers

2324429 what do we want housing when do we want it now
2324430 we have to tackle housing the same way we do treatment
2324431 how many people with hiv aids have sold everything they own to get treatment
2324432 policy makers address the lack of adequate housing as a barrier to effective hiv prevention treatment and care and that all governments fund and develop housing as a response to the aids pandemic
2324433 it is important before we conclude that we have to remember that there is still a lot of work to do in high income countries
2324434 that is what these people holding these signs are trying to remind us of we have got a lot of homeless people in rich countries because of the declining condition of the home mortgage crisis the rising price of gasoline
2324435 housing is such an important issue how can people take their medications if they dont even have a place to put them
2324436 and put the name of the country or city from which they came in the blank space on thursday the signs filled out by people from madagascar to south africa to uruguay to the bronx were posted throughout the iac convention center so everyone who passed would understand that people with hiv aids need housing unaids youth delegate korey anthony chisolm of guyana grasped the message right away
2324437 if im living with hiv and i dont have somewhere to stay that will affect my health
2324438 the ban on the use of federal funds for syringe exchange programs is a relic of the war on drugs that has become obsolete and must be done away with
2324439 scientists have proven that the programs do not increase drug use but do reduce hiv and hepatitis infections among drug users these are facts not opinions based on them the federal funding ban makes little sense and in fact is cruel as it relegates more people to suffering from these horrible diseases
2324440 what are the chances of your supporting this bill and signing on as a lead sponsor
2324441 condoms needles housing aids treatment now the u s fails on aids
2324442 as a black hiv positive gay man i find it deplorable to say im stabilized
2324443 activists have been giving solutions for a long time and they havent been listening
2324444 an earlier release might have given the bush administration second thoughts about requesting a 1 million decrease for cdcs domestic hiv prevention programs spurred presidential candidates to talk more readily about hiv aids in the u
2324445 while the fact that annual infection rates were up was the worst kept secret of the year the cdcs secrecy prevailed until this week when activists leaked the report two days before it was to be released
2324446 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
2324447 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
2324448 theyre always coming up with programs to save us they assume if you give sex workers sewing machines theyll quit sex work but women are not going to make as much money sewing as they will engaging in sex work
2324449 my government must not let its people die when there exists a simple affordable solution to helping people with hiv aids live normal lives
2324450 it is intolerable to then be told by governments and donor countries that it is unsustainable to raise her wages even though she is responsible for 7 500 worth of drugs a month for her patients
2324451 that policy makers address the lack of adequate housing as a barrier to effective hiv prevention treatment and care and that all governments fund and develop housing as a response to the aids pandemic
2324452 its not just wealthy countries like the u s that can address homelessness among people with aids this is an issue that demands global action
2324453 low income people living with hiv and aids act in their best interests based on the information they have people with aids and hiv would be better served if the department of health focused on expanding the concept of all inclusive care and then educated consumers to the benefits that care affords
2324454 we have recommended mandatory enrollment but the department of health has not made a decision we expect it in the next few weeks
2324455 we did get calls about a handful of problems but in each case we resolved them people who go to legal aid by definition it means something went wrong we cant draw conclusions from the people who went to legal aid
2324456 youd have to have a 12 th grade reading level and no reading impairment or developmental disability to participate in this survey
2324457 this is the population that didnt understand mandatory enrollment in the first place i think the problems were having are representative
2324458 we know that many people are reluctant to complain and especially file formal complaints
2324459 many people just shake their heads and say i cant fix this
2324460 this is not a financial decision we did no financial analysis the data shows that both managed care plans and snps do better than fee for service care and the data shows that snps and managed care plans have more case managers and specialists
2324461 if youre going to rely on the conclusions of the comparison study why not enroll everyone in snps if you want to put your money where your mouth is everyone should be auto enrolled in snps
2324462 i find it difficult to believe that they are making decisions without worrying about the financial ramifications bachrachs job is to manage medicaid which includes controlling costs
2324463 the comparison study doesnt show that managed care is that much more effective than regular fee for service insurance plans
2324464 the study tells you about viral load tests but it doesnt give you health outcomes what were the viral loads what were the cd4s its widget counting
2324465 spitzers medicaid reforms were supposed to result in all these savings which were going to be used to expand care now we hear that money is going to fill budget gaps
2324466 i dont know what to attribute peoples anger to this has been under discussion since we rolled out special needs plans four years ago
2324467 the department of health should focus on expanding the idea of all inclusive care then they can educate consumers to the benefits that care affords
2324468 one really positive thing since 2002 is theres more focus on the south eight years ago no one thought about the south being the u s center of the epidemic
2324469 we certainly need to get more allocations for the whole country but i will say the 300 million shifted to us in ryan white money helped us get rid of all the waiting lists a fully funded aids drug assistance program is something that most states take for granted
2324470 for those persons in political power both at the county and the city level this is a document that needs to get into their hands
2324471 we still have too many leaders who remain uninformed and choose to be so because they cant move past the moral issue and recognize aids as a public health issue
2324472 an inherent battle occurs during reauthorization and people view us as myopic in our agenda
2324473 but if you look at the flow of funding we need more equity and that involves an increasing investment at the federal local and state perspective as well as from the corporate community we send millions and millions overseas and thats a good thing but theres another part of the conversation that we have africa right here
2324474 consumers should immediately stop taking rize 2 the occasion rose 4 her and viapro and seek medical advice from their doctor if they are taking other medicines or if they have felt unwell when taking any of these products

2324478 todays announcement by national spokeswoman jackie blue that national would fund a 12 month course of herceptin also ignores the reality that 3 other cancer sufferers lives would be lost for every life that might be saved if 12 month herceptin treatment was publicly funded
2324479 what is so extraordinary about this is that national had been briefed two months ago by pharmacs ceo about the costs risks and uncertainties around the 12 month treatment
2324480 mr ryall was told that there is significant uncertainty around any additional benefit from the 12 month herceptin treatment over the 9 week herceptin treatment currently funded yet his party chooses to ignore the advice of pharmac and its specialist advisers
2324481 the national party is also aware that the minister can not lawfully direct pharmac to fund a 12 month course it also begs the question of just how will national run pharmac and just what decisions will it allow pharmac to make
2324482 concurrent herceptin is available as a treatment choice in other countries including australia and pharmacs position is that it has an open mind to funding 12 months herceptin treatment and when there was evidence that the 12 months treatment regime was more beneficial that the 9 week treatment regime
2324483 rather than reinforcing the teachings stories or values of the church the prophetic artist may challenge the church and confront the viewer with disturbing images which raise profound moral questions that religion cannot ignore

2324509 if the board wanted the opportunity to stuff up the pharmacy sector right royally this is it
2324510 pharmacs decision to continue funding the nine week regime for herceptin and not the twelve month regime for women with early stage breast cancer is a brave and difficuit decision but sadly it is the right one
2324511 herceptin is promoted as the magic bullet for early breast cancer treatment
2324512 the nine week course offers the best balance between potential benefits and harms for herceptin in choosing the nine week course of herceptin treatment pharmac has made a considered and careful decision
2324513 the herceptin debate has been intense and clouded by emotion and wishful thinking this decision will be unpopular and greeted with howls of uninformed outrage
2324514 roche has worked hard to reach an agreement with pharmac offering all available clinical information and a price that means it is as cost effective and as affordable as possible
2324515 the published and independently peer reviewed studies clearly show that 52 weeks of herceptin reduces the risk of death by 33 per cent whether it is given at the same time or after chemotherapy
2324516 pharmac is very critical of the clinical trial information supporting 52 weeks yet seems quite accepting of the significant data gaps that exist with the 9 week regimen such as a lack of survival benefit
2324517 32 countries have evaluated exactly the same evidence and come to the conclusion there are compelling reasons to fund herceptin for 52 weeks now new zealand remains the only oecd nation not to fund herceptin for 52 weeks
2324518 this is pharmacs decision and one that i can not legally intervene in however i am assured that the court directed review of the herceptin decision was thorough pharmac has assured the government that their decision was not made for reasons of cost
2324519 i have asked pharmac to maintain a careful watch on the scientific research around herceptin they have assured me that if any fresh evidence emerges around the relative merits of the two courses pharmac will review their decision
2324520 from this review i am advised that there is no new conclusive scientific evidence that would favour the 12 month herceptin course over the nine week course that pharmac currently funds the nine week course is supported by evidence from a well designed trial
2324521 i think it is important to reaffirm the governments confidence and support in the pharmac process i think it is also important to reaffirm that new zealand is committed to supporting the very important global sold trial into herceptin
2324522 i note pharmacs advice that the 12 month course of herceptin carries a greater risk of heart toxicity and that funding the 12 month course would mean that other drugs and treatments could not be provided
2324523 about 250 new zealand women have been approved for the nine week herceptin course and i acknowledge and respect the deeply held concerns of all breast cancer sufferers their families and the broader clinical community around the arguments over the two treatment regimes
2324524 certain kinds of important stories that simply cannot be covered except by deep pocketed traditional media organizations employing professional journalists
2324525 readers were able to observe the piteous wreckage behind the trolls braggadocio
2324526 who could throw all of these resources behind a single investigation
2324527 for investigative blockbusters like the trolls among us you have to go to dinosaur media such as the new york times the atlantic monthly or the new yorker
2324528 indicted in part on charges of circumventing legal giving limits by routing contributions though straw donors
2324529 are you one of the 8 million targeted for roundup by us govt
2324530 look i want this thing this trap snapped shut immediately
2324531 the worst plot since 9 11 that has been foiled and this is why you want us in power
2324532 deriving twenty percent of our power from wind generation in ten years is an ambitious but achievable goal that will jump start our economy and provide a critically needed new source of power
2324533 it is simply inexcusable that vermont derives only 0 2 percent of its electricity from wind while our neighboring states oil states and nearly all developed countries are embracing the wisdom of wind power our governor stubbornly resists and claims erroneously that vermonters dont want it it is time for jim douglas to stop tilting at windmills and let me build them instead
2324534 our governor stubbornly resists and claims erroneously that vermonters dont want it
2324535 we must standardize and fast track the process by which we study test plan obtain public input and issue permits
2324536 our expectations of the health system to deliver rests significantly on the quality of the relationship between health professionals and their employers
2324537 this is a groundbreaking agreement that shows just what can be achieved between professional medical associations and the countrys dhbs it underlines there is trust and confidence in our system that we must preserve
2324538 it will be disappointing for those who have lobbied for this change to hear that pharmac has reconfirmed today that it will not fund a 12 month course of herceptin in new zealand however medical insurance is there to fund the gap between what the public system can provide and what is available privately and ing will continue to cover its members for non pharmac funded but medsafe approved treatments
2324539 we understand that pharmac has limited resources to allocate in terms of drug subsidies and that has to look at the big picture when determining which drugs will receive funding
2324540 where the no 45 is in points were trying to get as high up in points as we can before the end of the season maybe well get in qualifying and everything will be fine if not boris has sat in the car and weve got him all fitted up
2324541 its depressing because our four guys in the shop put in so much work
2324542 two years in a row we havent started the motor
2324543 in my car its go all out and try to win it
2324544 id like to reward him im going to try as hard as i can but i have to restrain myself not take any of those crazy chances at least im running
2324545 we know tomorrow is going to be sunny set aside a half hour
2324546 i would have liked the chance to qualify but starting third wont be bad
2324547 the guys put a great deal of effort into the entry and i appreciate that they tried to accommodate my desire to race in front of my hometown fans in upstate new york
2324548 ill be there to support ron and my guys any way i can
2324549 we feel pretty confident well have a decent car youre always rolling the dice we saw the stars get aligned for us last weekend well see if we can do it two weeks in a row
2324550 we can only hope that we can win a couple more and just get further ahead of the competition when the final 10 starts
2324551 the bonus points that he has right now i think thats the only advantage he has
2324552 they just havent shown to me what they were showing earlier in the season but going into it with a 70 or a 40 point deficit which is kind of where were at right now thats a lot of points to try to make up when you havent been able to have the dominating wins like we had last year
2324553 having a string like weve had here winning four of the nine years ive been here thats something that were really really proud of
2324554 i mean batting 300 will get you in the baseball hall of fame and were over 400 right now at the glen
2324555 the glens elevation changes and slight banking in the turns should keep the water from standing and provide the drivers with challenging conditions
2324556 but we dont necessarily look toward that what we look toward right now is making our car the best that we can make it so we can be a contender in the race
2324557 its all in our hands got to learn to respect what we dont understand we are fortunate ones fortunate ones i swear

2324589 see how the radical homosexuals cant give good arguments to justify their behavior
2324590 far more ambiguous blurred and overlapping than any theory of genetic causality can allow examples of sexual flexibility dont square with genetic theories of rigid erotic predestination
2324591 to deny choice to make it appear that homosexuals cannot help it and to argue that any criticism of the gay lifestyle is as silly as criticism of being left handed or red haired
2324592 and this has been a deliberate strategy by homosexual activists they have done a very good job to convince a gullible public that homosexuals are born that way and cannot change
2324593 google reader sharing is the best tool that i have found so far
2324594 people say it must be a terrible job but its the huan side that makes every job different thats what i love about this job
2324595 people say it must be a terrible job but its the human side that makes every job different thats what i love about this job the variety you never know what you will be doing when you wake up in the morning ive liquidated the mongrel mob to the corner dairy you have to fast become an expert in any industry
2324596 i enjoy the technical side of it and i like the challenge of making the best of a bad situation but its stressful dealing with the doom and gloom the personalities and frustrations it is specialised its litigious and you have to have your wits about you generally you are personally liable for the debts you incur as liquidator so you have to know what you are doing id much prefer getting involved sooner and helping a company survive
2324597 just shrivel up and die they just hate the conflicts
2324598 but i say to people theres nothing i can do about whats gone you need to have a pretty thick skin
2324599 one of the roles we never envisaged is the counselling
2324600 we tend to do quite a bit of it financially they are torn apart and you find there are marriage splits because the house is mortgaged and mum and dad are not getting on
2324601 business collapses put a lot of stress on people ive had men in their late 50s in here just bawling their eyes out its quite sad with a bit of counselling they generally walk out feeling a lot better there is a lot of pride in running a business i guess they dont want to be seen being failures
2324602 he thanked me for everything i had done for him and said he had never been happier
2324603 unfortunately we are not white knights that can go and fix everything i do sympathise with their situation but at the end of the day i have a job to do as often as not they are relieved as much as everything they have been carrying the burden of trying to save a sinking ship its a weight off their shoulders because they can shift the problem onto someone else
2324604 why didnt i put that under a long time ago
2324605 ive referred plenty of files in my time to serious fraud that i thought were absolute goers and were quite high profile ive been disappointed in the results
2324606 weve got some pretty good legislation and powers there but they are just not used as they should be or not enforced our office puts in half of all referrals for that system banned directors and we are just a little firm in christchurch practitioners are not using the legislation its a cost effective way of protecting creditors
2324607 i find that all the time assets are always lower and liabilities are way higher some of them are so busy trying to dig themselves out of a hole they dont step back and look at it others dont really care and some arent aware of directors responsibilities
2324608 you dont have access to all the records that were available at the time and the director has got to be worth suing ninety per cent of the time they have put everything they have into the business
2324609 there is something missing its too easy to set up a company its too easy to get credit its too easy to lose all the money and declare yourself bankrupt and walk away
2324610 if they are silly enough to deal with that same guy that they got burnt with last time they have to take a certain amount of that risk
2324611 any old kiwi battler can have a go the insolvency laws are there as a safety net and help an economy because everyone knows whats going to happen if a person fails there is something there to handle it its not the quickest one off the block who gets paid
2324612 its been an enormous year for telecom and were really pleased to have come in in line with full guidance
2324613 clearly what happens with a stock like this is when future dividends are seen as more likely to be lower than higher the share price will adjust down and thats whats happening
2324614 in an ideal world when companies are reinvesting significant sums they are growing their earnings to at least maintain their return on capital but what were seeing with telecom is earnings decreasing and capex increasing which is about the worst combination
2324615 a lot of us feel that this is actually more of a structural change than a cyclical one
2324616 i responded not sure exactly what i said but it further enraged him and he swerved into me
2324617 his door bumped my knee and his mirror was right in front of me so i pushed down and away from it and it broke off
2324618 he continued to push me off the road and i started to go down as my bike began to go under the wheel

2324624 there is just as much sex going on at byu as at any other university its just they get married first
2324625 sexual transgression was the most pervasive and persistent problem i had to deal with as a bishop
2324626 i saw it as my calling to help members have a healthy understanding of sexuality it is one of the gifts from loving heavenly parents who are themselves sexual beings
2324627 i opened the box and found a diamond ring inside

2324778 life begins as a quest of the child for the man and ends as a journey by the man to rediscover the child
2324779 its something that i look at we have probably a 1 in 5 or 1 in 10 shot of winning the race we put a lot of effort into our road racing not that we dont put a lot of effort into our oval racing as well this is something ive done for 15 years now and i have a lot of experience road racing
2324780 fuel mileage has a lot to do with it and timing a caution correctly
2324781 as far as passing watkins sonoma theyre both about the same you know our cars seem to stop really good and that helps the other side is a lot of my competitors know that were good on the road races so sometimes they give me way if i start to show that im there theyll just let us have the position so i think theres a bunch of things that equate to what that stat shows
2324782 every year weve climbed the ladder in points and we work ourselves up into a higher position
2324783 im confident by the end of the year well learn from some of the mistakes we made again with the car of tomorrow you know its our first year of running the car of tomorrow year round when youre a single car team it takes a little longer to find solutions for some of the problems
2324784 the people side of it is probably the most difficult getting everybody on the same team it sounds crazy you would think everybody working together would be on the same team anyway but you have a lot of cliques a lot of groups theres a lot of egos in this sport so trying to get everybody to work together and be a team to make the best product that we can possibly make and bring it to the race track every weekend has probably been the hardest thing
2324785 by the time you get home on monday youve got to be already having cars ready so that they can roll on the truck on wednesday and go the next weekend
2324786 you have to be really well prepared youve got to really look into the future of what youre going to need to make your team better
2324787 its hard to work on your stuff and go to the race track and make improvements you know if it was a goalpost that stood still it would be pretty easy to kick field goals but every week the competition gets a little bit better the field goal moves a little farther down and youve got to push your guys and push your team to be better and stronger
2324788 thats the first thing there if i had to pay a driver id probably be in trouble but because i am the driver and the owner we can do a little bit of give and take and get through like were doing now
2324789 sponsors and everybody want to be involved with a team that can win races
2324790 i look at this weekend as an opportunity of putting our team in victory lane theres only been three teams this year that have been in victory lane so if we could pull it off that would be big
2324791 this is a huge problem and it will go on and on until the documents run out
2324792 we are dealing with criminal fraternities operating on a national basis and stealing good cars to order
2324793 this is another very worrying data foul up by the government the last thing long suffering motorists need at the moment is the thought that they might be the victims of car crime fraud

2324798 that company is so great at enter what i dont want to be good at if you are looking for that they are your best bet if you want enter what im better at then its worth the extra investment to get what you really need you deserve that and otherwise why take a bigger risk than you have to

2324811 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2324812 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2324813 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2324814 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2324855 the major chocolate companies are not able to prove the elimination of exploited child labor in their cocoa supply nor show concrete improvements in west african farmers lives consumers cannot be assured today that their favorite chocolate candies are made without abusive child labor
2324856 consumers should reward companies with ethical integrity in their supply chains and continue to demand that worlds largest chocolate companies answer the question of how consumers can be assured their chocolate is not produced using exploited child labor

2324858 youve got a group of guys malcolm williams made a great play yesterday in a team situation youve got brandon collins youve got james kirkendoll youve got dan buckner
2324859 weve got some really good competition going on there and i feel like by the time that we break camp well have five or six guys that well feel really good about
2324860 hes really got unique speed for his size and thats going to help him a lot plus he loves the game and hes always trying to learn i think thats probably my favorite thing about him hes really personal and ready to learn
2324861 i like throwing the ball deep to malcolm he does a good job of not letting the defense put their hands on him hes big and strong and gets off the line
2324862 hes coming along every day hes catching a lot of balls we spent a lot of time together in the summer working on his hands playing with tennis balls and things like that
2324863 dan has a lot of talent and body control plus hes fast
2324864 you definitely could see him being a deep threat there are a lot of young receivers with a lot of talent
2324865 i dont have a timetable for figuring out the receivers
2324866 there are plenty of guys capable of making plays and weve just got to get the right ones out there weve got two guys right now who we know we can count on in jordan shipley and quan cosby
2324867 i just want to do whats best for the team to win
2324868 we need his feet we need him to get off schedule plays and we need to be able to run the zone read to be successful at what we want to do
2324869 i think colt surprised himself over the last half of the year with his ability to run the ball
2324870 and i think quite honestly he surprised all of us a little bit
2324871 wed like to do whatever we need to do to move the ball
2324872 if were a spread offense the zone read play is really important to us and wed like for him to continue to build on it mccoy did a better job in the spring hes healthy now hes much stronger hes continued at the same level of speed so wed really like to see him do that and be a factor running the ball

2324888 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2324889 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
2324890 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
2324891 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
2324892 for the manufacturer its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs
2324893 they have a frequent buyer program i dont know what the criteria is where you get rewards and i shop at eddie bauer a lot
2324894 it included a one piece that said the forthcoming fall collection is inspired by paws up i took it out put it on the keyboard of my computer and sent an email to corporate communications with lots of links to news stories back when the resort was in the news for various things
2324895 what i want to know is did they do any due diligence
2324896 there are so many worthwhile places if they want to tie into a montana entity theres the rolling dog ranch they rescue injured animals
2324897 theres also camp mak a dream a beautiful spot that does great work for kids who need it
2324898 i just wanted to let them know that as a dedicated long time customer that i dont like it im not going to stop doing business with eddie bauer absolutely not but to my mind at least they could have made a better choice
2324899 why such a backlash from a few locals over a silly phrase
2324900 celebrate the spirit and beauty of the state of montana
2324901 i was born in mainland china so i am immensely honored to be one of the relay torchbearers in the beijing olympics which is the realization of a dream for millions of chinese people

2324906 we dont want to put a gloss on anything but the money is definitely there if youre a hard worker
2324907 by the time they take into account our tax rates and a 9 per cent superannuation contribution from employers they are taking home a lot more than they would in new zealand
2324908 if you have been a banker for 20 years and you think you are going to go into the mining industry it is not that easy
2324909 most kiwis dont even think of western australia thirty thousand go to australia every year and 75 per cent of them settle on the east coast
2324910 no one would describe telecoms current operating performance as strong but we knew that before this result
2324911 the higher depreciation track and subsequently lower net profit forecasts are relatively immaterial to value
2324912 telecom is now operationally separated a new leadership team has been appointed and the implementation of our transformation is in full flow
2324913 in this new environment customers have more choice and opportunities than ever before
2324914 they have more to add than gpg has to add it will be very good for tower australia they can do more now than gpg can
2324915 weve always got cash on our balance sheet and any more is always welcome particularly in these soggy times

2324920 its tough to put on a completely different hat when you cross the tasman its one thing to be the market leader and have all the cost and benefit of scale here but to be an aggressor in a different market place is a challenge
2324921 telecom is simply not in a position to compete with telstra and optus in this area so it is good to see some decisive action from the new executive team
2324922 its really for us to prove that this decision was right and show how we can grow our business
2324923 we decided last year to get married on 8 august
2324924 it is such a lucky number and its only once in a life time
2324925 we chose this date because its the opening of the olympics its very memorable
2324926 we decided to marry on this day in 2003 when we were still in college
2324927 the clerk checked our forms gave us the certificates and congratulated us
2324928 the beijing olympic games starts from today we are ready and beijing is ready
2324929 people are excited about the games and the opening ceremony tonight i wont disclose the secret but we did have three rehearsals to let people have glimpse of what it is going to be except for the most top secret one
2324930 outside the air quality is good though it looks a bit misty
2324931 we cannot judge the air quality by its appearance but should trust the finding i think tonight we will be lucky usually if morning is misty the night will be much better
2324932 for drizzle everything will just continue for shower i think during our second rehearsal we have some kind of rain but the performance was continuing
2324933 if the rain gets heavier something will be modified we have contingency plans for three kinds of scenarios
2324934 the games is an international event so we not only want to showcase the culture and history of china but also try to be international and understandable to our friends of the world
2324935 we spare no efforts in terms of making the games safe
2324936 the security forces have been reinforced and we share intelligence with the worlds intelligent agencies
2324937 they dont know what remedies are there for them like in case of an abusive relationship they still dont know who to approach for help
2324938 we should not only support them with legal issues but in their workplaces where they need more recognition
2324939 although it is difficult to balance the time for your work and family women always try to make time for their children as they are the backbones of the families
2324940 we want to use the 2011 session as an opportunity to show the world the opportunities and possibilities that africa can offer we want to show that africa is a continent of hope and enthusiasm
2324941 on behalf of the city of durban i am delighted that we have won the right to host such an important and prestigious event
2324942 it comes on the eve of our teams formal reception in beijing and a day before our athletes attend the opening of the beijing olympics and is great news for durban south africa and africa
2324943 as a municipality we want to thank all kind hearted people who contributed in monetary and other forms
2324944 our museums have moved from being old and outdated bastions representing past racist ideologies to being part of a new non racial non sexist society
2324945 our heritage sector is working in much more dynamic and creative ways in our new south african context yet learning and interacting with international trends and innovations
2324946 the seriousness with which we take our museums and heritage sector
2324947 many museums may seem to be inert beautiful old buildings holding the old silver of the ruling dynasties of the past and the art of the old masters
2324948 but there are other ways of conceiving of museums for they are in fact spaces of tremendous potential for democratic reflection and civic education they are spaces open for continuing change and interpretation of the past present and future
2324949 the libraries of timbuktu force us to think anew about the very notion of a library and an archive
2324950 they help us to take a closer look at the manuscripts as documents reflecting human effort and communication and as documents with genealogies that include other works produced elsewhere
2324951 our intention is to meet with them to discuss issues around their land in trust application for middleboro and to be in position if that application is approved
2324952 first priority right now is to get land in trust
2324953 as the governor said our intention is to continue to meet with them to discuss issues around their land in trust application for middleboro and to be in position if that application is approved to be able to engage with them

2324991 i think the new shirt for the premiership is awesome
2324992 the club have brought back the old colours and the hoops and i cant wait to wear it for the first match of the season
2324993 seeing the new shirt and the new shop gave me a good feeling with the first big match only weeks away i cant wait to put on the shirt and cheer the boys on come on you saints
2324994 im delighted with the new saints superstore and how well rhino and the club have worked together in its development
2324995 the superstore is a marked improvement on what we had before and is a demonstration as to the direction we want the club to take northampton saints has long been a club that sets the standards off the field and i believe that our new superstore is the best in the country it both adds to our supporters shopping experience and anticipation of the coming guinness premiership season
2324996 rhino pure rugby are delighted with the redesigned saints superstore
2324997 we aimed to create a modern retail outlet which will become a flagship for the rhino brand and which northampton saints and its supporters can be proud of and which also reflects the ambition of us all

2325007 to suggest that everton football club will suddenly and dramatically open its arms to any would be investor or buyer should the destination kirkby project be given a governmental green light is totally mischievous and wholly misleading simply because our chairman bill kenwright has made it clear at each and every agm going back five years that he will continue to sit down and discuss the clubs future with any individual or group which boasts integrity and financial clout
2325008 bill has often said that premier league football has become a game not for multi millionaires but for billionaires and that pertinent analysis still holds true
2325009 bill has never attempted to hide the fact that he personally does not have the funds to move his club forward to where he and the supporters want it to be and to where they believe it should be at the forefront of the english game
2325010 self evidently any club which can boast a stadium which is modern fit for purpose and capable of expansion does represent a more attractive proposition to potential investors
2325011 logic therefore dictates that if we do find a new home efc would as a club which has finished inside the top six on three occasions in recent years be a more attractive proposition to investors

2325059 we were good enough to be there we needed a little something to beat the leaders but it seemed like last year was the first year we were competitive and actually were quick in practice hopefully we can get back to that level
2325060 but its hard to beat guys when they do it 12 or 13 times a year and this year we only do it once but weve got all our set up stuff and weve tried to get our shock package built as similar as we could from last year
2325061 i wouldnt count any of those guys out by any means
2325062 when youre a jet youre a jet all the way
2325063 country road is a great complement to our existing rural telephone and clec operations in maine and is an important step in our expansion in the new england region

2325065 secretaries of the senate have presided occasionally throughout history when for one reason or another the presiding officer either wasnt there or the senate wasnt organized
2325066 if a senator is available a senator will preside there wasnt this time
2325067 it is an opportunity for the companies to continue to put products on the market without a pre market evaluation by the fda
2325068 this is a provision that recognizes the reality that as the agency staffs up it wont be able to do every single thing from day 1
2325069 here was our concern lets say i launch a product today thats a straight up the gut traditional cigarette
2325070 the big fear was you go out there and the fda comes out with regulations and says oh thats not a registered product
2325071 we have three people there but we could end up being more one tight end two wide receivers a tailback and a fullback
2325072 lansfords kind of doubling as a y with tommy galt and dan gronkowski and also what james calls the f position which i used to call the h position youll get all confused with that because he calls the h r
2325073 where are my rights wheres hippa and all that other stuff when it comes to me doesnt seem to be equitable to me im wide open but i have to worry about all these other people
2325074 one kid that sings pretty good is this justin lewis they actually requested a few songs and he got up there with the microphone
2325075 hes a big offensive lineman and he has this high voice the first one he sang was a hymn i think his fathers a minister
2325076 i tell the freshmen look were going to ask you to sing live through the moment and life will go a lot easier youll get laughed at or booed or applauded depending on how you do if you refuse to do it youre going to be doing it a lot everybodys done it
2325077 in high school i wore 32 and couldnt get it so i got no 30
2325078 i encourage everybody to get a hat from where youre from and put your number on the side for game day
2325079 i would love to get danny pearman whos a clemson grad to sing the fight song
2325080 i guess thats the biggest fear ive got during this camp
2325081 ive been trying to brush up on my words i heard it the other night when the freshmen had to sing it i went to one basketball game here so ive heard it played one time as far as the words are concerned id better get it down before camp or its going to be an embarrassing situation
2325082 i think people can take some assurance from here that theyre not being conned at the pump
2325083 we will take whatever investigative steps are necessary to bring this to a conclusion
2325084 we know where you work we know where you live
2325085 i think we always are concerned every time something like this happens that other attacks will occur
2325086 this is the standard supervised release agreement i went over this with the defendant
2325087 he asked to sleep on it for a night he doesnt want to be supervised
2325088 no one is accusing him of intentionally maliciously harming the animals
2325089 the animals are the victims here and they dont have a voice
2325090 were passionate about this case we believe the animals were subjected to needless suffering
2325091 for all we know the citizen complaint was rank hearsay and not based on personal knowledge
2325092 because that was the source of our complaint we didnt have probable cause either
2325093 without a permit i would very much doubt you could have that many dogs
2325094 its possible he could be cited under the zoning code

2325107 analysis of iraqi market suitability for individual home water purifiers
2325108 with so many gastro intestinal diseases and health related issues here in iraq and poor water quality being the prime reason i thought what better way to bring this issue to the front than to talk about it
2325109 the army gives us such a great opportunity to continue an education and with new improvements to the montgomery g i bill a soldier would have to be insane not to take advantage of it and get something better out of their military career
2325110 this degree from cmu is just one of many goals that i have written on a tattered sheet of paper thats over 10 years old now and it keeps me focused and on track for the future
2325111 a ph d is the next educational goal on my list
2325112 unsere eltern sind auch irgendwann der arbeit nachgezogen und haben vom staat nicht verlangt dass er eine t gliche heimfahrt von mehr als 200 kilometern subventioniert
2325113 but weve got some good options it is indeed inexperienced and thats the tough thing because with new guys playing together it takes some time for each player to really learn his role and understand how they all fit together
2325114 heres the thing about the offensive line we have good guys behind them we have great backs and thats the number one thing you have to have backs and receivers and if you have that all the offensive line has to do is develop and play together and give maximum effort
2325115 it is still joe because jason missed the entire spring and so we have to be intelligent and say it is joe and jordan gibbs had every snap in the spring
2325116 now it us up to jason to have a good preseason and we need to figure out is he a left or a right tackle but it is on jason he needs to say im healthy im committed there is no doubt about jasons ability its does he want to be great now
2325117 i mean youd like to do that because if they are any good they dont like to and dont want to come out
2325118 thats a winners mentality and were looking for guys who dont want to come off the field they should hate coming off the field
2325119 he could be a decent player on defense over here on offense he has a chance to be a superstar
2325120 weve going to be playing against teams using the international rules and with the trapezoid lane
2325121 so thats going to be a great learning experience for our girls because the game is played at a quicker pace and thats how were going to have to play this year now that marcedes walker has graduated
2325122 but more importantly i think that going out of the country is something that will enable our players to learn a lot about the world around them
2325123 i think that complacency is a danger now that these guys are getting a little older and feeling a little more confident but their effort has been outstanding right now we have four tackles who have played and started a lot of games and they are all having a good camp
2325124 i think one of the things weve found is the best motivator is competition and depth and right now they are all pushing each other so you cant help but be pleased with what weve seen so far
2325125 ive always thought that you have no chance to play great defense unless you have guys up front who can make plays
2325126 i think when you look at where our guys came from very few of them played defensive line before they got here i think that philosophy finding fast athletic kids and making them defensive linemen gives us the quickness and athleticism that we need in this scheme to be effective
2325127 i dont know who is going to end up the starters though mick williams has really been playing at a high level right now
2325128 but i can put any of these guys in and feel good about it the one thing i will say is ive talked to jabaal sheard about how he needs to increase his effort and how he needed to become more coachable and hes responded well hes working harder ive never worried about his talent or his instincts it is the fundamentals and techniques and if he keeps working on those things hell be a starter and a great player for us

2325136 ya know you did pretty good but all that coveting your neighbors pinata tsk tsk tsk
2325137 i tried to do too much at the beginning of the season
2325138 and it hurt me as the season progressed i started to realize the need to do the same things we had done the year before
2325139 i put a lot of pressure on myself and there was no reason to i felt we had to come out and blow everybody away and prove that it wasnt a fluke the year before we got out of rhythm and out of our game plan after a couple of games of getting those jitters out i calmed down
2325140 i dont feel theres one single person were going to pinpoint during seven on seven drills this summer which the players organized we were throwing tds to the fullbacks to the tight ends to everybody
2325141 math is really about the human mind about how people can think effectively and why curiosity is quite a good guide
2325142 you dont see what youre seeing until you see it

2325145 nothing in this building is more important than a responsible budget and to fix our broken budget system

2325147 hes obsessed thats why the song is so brilliant and poignant
2325148 hes really good the thing about liam is you havent heard the half of it
2325149 if he could even be bothered to finish some of the songs he started
2325150 honestly theyre amazing but he suffers the curse of the gallaghers its like f g hell cant finish it
2325151 ive got demos of his at home with about 40 tunes which if he could be bothered would be amazing

2325153 among the many papers which dumbledore left in his will to the hogwarts archives
2325154 beedle was somewhat out of step with his times in preaching a message of brotherly love for muggles
2325155 many of us wizards first discovered that magic could not bring back the dead
2325156 at first my method with others was to listen to what they said and expect them to act accordingly now my method is to listen to what they say and then observe what they do
2325157 i see a lot of former infantry soldiers here most are interested in continuing some facet of their army career and focus in an area of law enforcement
2325158 aces has a lot to offer soldiers particularly to warriors in transition
2325159 we have counselors instructors and interactive computer programs all aimed at helping soldiers and family members succeed in their goals
2325160 some are trying to stay in the army while others are looking to make a transition and want to be more marketable
2325161 i want to make sure the college is providing the best possible service
2325162 im working to develop relationships with universities so i can offer students the easiest transitions back into the classroom
2325163 i even got a perfect score on one of the sections
2325164 some may have a speech impediment that causes stress about performing speeches in class or reading out loud or multiple appointments can cause a soldier to fall behind
2325165 but its a challenge that pays off in the long run
2325166 the success of the 5 200 mile round trip convoy and the combat logistics patrols at the national training center stems around the mission capability of our trucks
2325167 our maintenance section had our trucks in tip top shape not a single vehicle had to be towed the entire annual training
2325168 the metrics of what these soldiers have accomplished is simply astonishing plus consider the fact that there were no injuries to any soldier not even a dent on a truck throughout the entire mission these soldiers showed their mettle and did an amazing job
2325169 you have distinguished yourself in safety excellence and have brought intrinsic value for safety to the rest of the army each person at amc knows they are a part of an organization bigger than themselves you have infused the culture as a band of brothers
2325170 amc continued to improve its safety and occupational health program by using safety rapid review teams to provide direct multidisciplinary assistance to commanders in the field by sharing best practices across the command and by using weekly production updates with amc sites as safety council meetings between the commanding general and the commanders of those facilities
2325171 amc also reduced lost work days by 11 percent from fiscal year 2006 to 2007 and reduced its total case incident rates days away restricted transfers rates in spite of increased mission and higher optempo at our facilities
2325172 this award is for the entire amc enterprise from the worker at the ammo plant the arsenal the field support brigade there is a total focus on safety and im extremely proud of everyone in amc for winning this significant award
2325173 what you do at radford is a critical asset for the warfighter and you do it safely you set the example for the rest of amc and are the epitome of the leadership and workforce here at amc
2325174 what we found out especially with the war coming along was that we had some capabilities that would be useful for the soldiers that are in the field today or at least sooner than 2015
2325175 so the army went back looked at that and decided to spin out some of the systems from the core program
2325176 its like flying a remote controlled plane really only its slower you can hit stop if you dont know what youre doing or you can make it hover it makes it really easy to fly
2325177 sometimes its frustrating because its new and doesnt work all the time other times it works great thats what were going to have in iraq so were trying to get it the best we can
2325178 part of the future of the army is to have a ubiquitous network end to end that allows the soldier from the foxhole to get intelligence or situational awareness from higher and also for whatever hes collecting to go higher
2325179 if it has to increase power to send the data over that distance it will do that if it can
2325180 or if it actually has to decrease power because maybe thats not as important a transmission as another transmission or the distance isnt as great it will do that as well
2325181 were really at the beginning of a long journey and one of the reasons were out here in this culminating event is to make our final assessment of where we have to go
2325182 we know that some stuff worked some stuff didnt work so well
2325183 you can imagine that when youre doing it by direct fire youre in more danger than when youre doing it by indirect fire because what weve allowed the soldiers here to do is to be able to see the area that they would normally have to go into blind
2325184 what i like best about all of this is that were getting an opportunity to use tools weve already learned and integrate them now with the new age of battle new robotics early warning devices and all that kind of stuff
2325185 its pretty much in the long run going to keep soldiers alive
2325186 whats not normal here is to have an entire unit thats formed to use our equipment in this early stage of development and give us feedback on it understanding that for them sometimes that can be frustrating because parts of it dont work well parts of it work really well
2325187 soldiers are used to getting equipment that works right away what were asking for them to do is to use stuff that were just starting with and give us feedback so when it actually gets deployed it does work right away for the soldier
2325188 i dont know if i could have one if i wanted to
2325189 joe would get upset and overpower you on the next play
2325190 with me im going to get upset and im going to outsmart you on the next play
2325191 i went down there with a chip on my shoulder
2325192 being out on the field a little more i started to learn what to expect
2325193 marcbot iv is an observation platform that gives soldiers the ability to have some stand off range for a suspected improvised explosive device
2325194 instead of having to go down to physically look at an ied or suspected ied they can send the marcbot iv to put an extra set of eyes on it to verify whether or not it is an ied
2325195 the marcbot iv is available for anybody from administration to explosive ordinance disposal personnel to use its designed so anyone can use it
2325196 i think that it is definitely a valuable and useful tool
2325197 it helps cut down on the static time a convoy has so there is less time for it to be identified
2325198 its been really great to see the army go outside of the box and finding a cheap but really good solution
2325199 it solves a problem instead of risking soldiers lives you are risking a robot
2325200 how does one sum up in a few short minutes the many memories built upon more than 60 years of friendship
2325201 there is no possible way of doing justice to something of this magnitude
2325202 so i will simply remind us of the words of albert schweitzer that the important things in life are the signs of love and friendship that we leave behind when we go away
2325203 you could see such signs at the farewell fest here on cambrai fritsch kaserne on 30 may as the citizens and lord mayor of darmstadt graciously said thank you
2325204 you could see the signs as city officials prayed for the safety of our soldiers deploying to combat and welcomed them warmly when they returned
2325205 you could see the signs on that terrible day in september 2001 a day of indescribable sadness in darmstadts history as well as the local citizens laid flowers at our gates and embraced us while we mourned
2325206 the friendships they have inspired which make today a day of celebration and thanks thanks that we have been blessed to live with neighbors who have made this such a warm and caring community
2325207 to the city of darmstadt flown in freedom and friendship over cambrai fritsch kaserne
2325208 in the name of the magistrate and the citizens of darmstadt i sincerely thank you for this precious gift
2325209 we appreciate it as a symbol of all gifts of the usa and its people and of friendship
2325210 it also is a symbol of the pride of your nation of the most powerful democratic country that the world has ever seen we will cherish this flag
2325211 a deeply moving moment because in some sense it represents the end of the postwar period for darmstadt
2325212 soldiers of the u s army brought peace freedom and democracy to our city in the past sixty years we have enjoyed your protection by your presence you have ensured the independence of west germany preserved our freedom and given europe the longest period of peace ever
2325213 but you also have changed the germans beyond the political scope
2325214 you have deeply influenced and modernized our society and our culture through music through swing jazz rock and roll and pop through coke chewing gum petticoats woodstock jfk and i have a dream through candy bombers and comics through your liberality your fairness and your love for the individual germany today bears only little resemblance to the germany of the decades before the second world war
2325215 so i willingly repeat what i have said on the 30th of may at the german american freundschaftsfest we all have become americans a little bit at least and that is good indeed
2325216 we hope that the staff canteen of the german police in kabul afghanistan is as good as we have been told
2325217 when you sit there eating german roast please think of darmstadt a little bit
2325218 lt col david astin has commanded his garrison to the highest standards to the very end he continually motivates people with his positive outlook on life and can do it attitude through his personal involvement he has drawn down the operations of his command with as little impact to the tenant units and garrison workers as possible
2325219 he even learned how to tap a keg without getting all the vips and himself wet
2325220 i would again like to thank the city of darmstadt for the warm relations and the support they have given to the members of the u s forces stationed in their community
2325221 and while we will inactivate the garrison there will continue to be small enclaves of u s forces remaining in the immediate future that will continue to enjoy your hospitality
2325222 those are probably the two right now that would be on the leading edge if i were to say today knowing that this is practice no 3 but thats where we stand right now
2325223 the pain was not allowing him to be effective in our eyes nor his
2325224 we gave him monday off to sort through it as you kind of build up to what you expect to happen in a year then it doesnt necessarily go like that
2325225 i think former byu coach lavell edwards might have been watching today
2325226 from what i understood he could control the weather so maybe he knew we needed a cloudy day
2325227 why should i outsource my web and graphic design when i can create my own look in microsoft and save money
2325228 this morning two planes were delayed for half an hour because the visibility was only 200 meters 656 ft because smoke and smog shrouded the airport
2325229 its a huge task because we are still facing the problem of looting
2325230 we know that objects are going to pakistan and on to the international market its very urgent work if we dont do something now it will be too late
2325231 people are so poor they are just looking for ways to buy bread we need to open their minds as they dont know the value of their history we have to give them that knowledge and then they will protect it
2325232 hezb e islami and taliban and other extremists might use explosives and blow up this stone
2325233 undoubtedly it is one of the finest in the world of this period

2325235 unidad y diversidad del espa ol nuevos retos del espa ol en el mundo
2325236 la disgregaci n del espa ol e incluso la desmembraci n de muchas de sus variedades en lenguas o dialectos independientes fue una de las cuestiones que m s preocupaba a los estudiosos de la lengua actualmente de ese pron stico se ha pasado a una creencia firme en la potencialidad de nuestro idioma y en la idea de que el espa ol es una lengua que a pesar de su gran diversidad se mantiene fuerte y unida o dicho de otra manera es esa variedad precisamente la que le aporta riqueza
2325237 goza de una salud envidiable y de unas posibilidades que el tiempo y los habitantes ir n determinando

2325244 t he door flew off and almost killed my daughter
2325245 you could tell it the ride was pretty much out of control and coming apart
2325246 the door itself came apart and went flying over to where the kids were
2325247 there is in fact no evidence that a single part of the ride actually detached at any point
2325248 the san jose vice unit served several search warrants one in milpitas and one in san francisco regarding an ongoing investigation of the past four months
2325249 it is a very good decision and definitely a victory for home schooling families in the state
2325250 i have seen a lot of the videos and it brings me to tears
2325251 what some people think is pretty is actually something thats very gruesome and gross
2325252 we had a better quarter when compared to the same period last year with sales up 3 5 and earnings before items increasing 23 million despite a 5 9 drop in paper shipments clearly the synergies are starting to show in our results and the projected benefits from new initiatives have led us to increase our synergy target to 250 million
2325253 having said that the announced price increases for papers in june are necessary to adjust to this new business environment of structurally higher input costs
2325254 while trade publications have painted a fairly negative demand picture for the paper industry so far in 2008 domtars core business has weathered the storm quite well with no lack of order downtime shipments to production close to 100 and paper inventories virtually flat from march end levels the closure of the port edwards mill in june further tightened our manufacturing system the u s economy remains challenging and we will be closely tracking our order books and will make adjustments to production where needed to respond to customer demand
2325255 the financial results in our wood business improved significantly in the second quarter better than what we had expected and this is due to higher prices but also to the concerted efforts made by our employees to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of our operations
2325256 i am pleased with this progress and look forward to making additional improvements going forward
2325257 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2325258 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2325259 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2325260 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2325261 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2325262 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2325263 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2325264 it is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path
2325265 who will take the final steps to 1600 pennsylvania avenue
2325266 a national reputation as a forceful and tireless champion for regular hard working people
2325267 theyre willing to kill anybody who gets in their way
2325268 people who farm now are not doing this for laughs despite the fact hollywood still thinks that theyre doing it to make a lot of money
2325269 theyre willing to kill anybody who gets in their way theyre taking money back to those who kill prosecutors judges and law enforcement
2325270 they come into our own national parks and risk the lives of sheriffs and others
2325271 theyre using family or very trusted family friends they dont just use anybody
2325272 youre recruited in for that purpose as long as youre trusted each person has his function
2325273 the people that are growing this are good at what they do
2325274 the goal is not just to eradicate the plants but to go after the organizations
2325275 in the past all weve been able to do is what we call whack and stack

2325285 the measures we have taken so far can guarantee fairly good air quality during the games
2325286 any friend who knows beijings environmental and meteorological conditions can easily come to the conclusion that beijings air quality is up to standards under current emission and weather circumstances

2325290 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2325291 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country

2325300 one primary trouble with the american educational system is its concern with answers as opposed to giving students questions
2325301 the student who is a better learner will have a clearer sense of his or her own weaknesses
2325302 good learners know what it is that they dont know and can ask questions about it
2325303 super learners arent passive they dont simply absorb information but actively reconstitute it into meaningful patterns
2325304 good learners see the difference between relevant information and irrelevant information
2325305 there is a myth that good student have photographic memories and dont work hard actually they are quite hard working but dont feel that they have to understand everything the first time through do not give up until the ahamoment
2325306 good learners make lots of mistakes just as poor learners do but they learn from their mistakes
2325307 the only thing that interferes with my learning is my education
2325308 the idea is that learning is not based on objects and contents that are stored as though in a library rather the idea is that learning is like a utility like water or electricity that flows in a network or a grip that we tap into when we want the way network learns is the way people learn they are both complex systems and the organization of each depends on connections connectivism george siemens
2325309 people talk about motivation but the real issue is ownership
2325310 this report considers how approaches to learning have evolved and what impact the new technologies dubbed
2325311 explore and experiment try out a variety of tools and use the tools themselves to capture your learning but keep your context in mind page 72
2325312 the rapid e learning blog shares practical tips and tricks to help you become a rapid e learning pro it is hosted by tom kuhlmann who has over 15 years of hands on experience in the training industry and currently runs the community at articulate
2325313 anyone who stops learning is old whether at twenty or eighty anyone who keeps learning stays young
2325314 anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new
2325315 i cant stand it anymore i have to do this call me what you like but looks like i have to jump on the bandwagon as well so here goes another blog about e learning my version of course sometimes i find it absolutely comical when i hear people complaining about the quality of education on the internet when no one ever bothered to scrutinize the quality of face to face teaching we are so bothered whether students actually log online to view our notes when we dont even recognize the 200 odd students in our lecture face to face such dichotomy the funniest thing is that it is as though there is someone else to be blamed for what is not working with e learning or whatever learning you care to mention who is to be blamed if a lecture is boring who made it boring if a lecture or teaching experience is captivation who made it so you

2325317 he who asks a question may be a fool for five minutes but he who never asks a question remains a fool forever
2325318 in one session zaid himself shared that he recorded one session of a professor if i can remember correctly just the voice and then he added a powerpoint presentation of the talk which i thought was brilliant and at no extra cost
2325319 lecturers who know nothing else except their powerpoint slides they are just powerpoint notes not process they have no stories no biographies no histories
2325320 by learning you will teach by teaching you will understand
2325321 this promising new weblog by zaid ali alsagoff is devoted to open learning resources around the world zaid is located in malaysia his blog is especially valuable for its extensive listing of links to bloggers who write about elearning and its multiple links to learning tools elearning sites opencourseware sites university podcasts and learning repositories
2325322 many excellent free online learning resources out there that are not being fully utilized by the global intelligence learning network
2325323 the key is not whether we fail or succeed during our studies put how much effort and attitude we put into it if the effort and right attitude is internalized into the students mind becomes a habit during the learning process he or she will eventually succeed trust me
2325324 i particularly appreciate his belief that sites like ours are the beginning of a new era in education where free learning systems open resources and community involvement will change the way we teach and learn
2325325 if you have your own blog do like zaid did he linked to this series and showed some before and after images its also a great way to share your own tips and tricks
2325326 two other excellent regularly updated and substantive educational blogs are oculture and zaid learn
2325327 zaid ali alsagoff however has already discussed the new oer booklet in a post on zaidlearn and followed it with another excellent post on open educational resources earlier this week this is one of those occasions where i think it is best for me to simply point to the good work of another blogger
2325328 zaid ali alsagoff another blogger has compiled his top 10 list of blogs related to online learning they look pretty good most are bloggers that i know and follow but a couple are new if you are look for a place to start this list is as good a place as any
2325329 first came across this site thanks to a reference on zaids blog which has lots of other interesting posts regarding free resources

2325333 we want the development of modal insan model citizen students who can think critically and creatively who are able to solve problems and have the ability to adapt themselves to an ever changing global environment
2325334 critical thinking course would be the perfect challenge and opportunity to test all my untested theories and suggestions on effective learning
2325335 i dont feel guilty about cheating on zaids online quiz half the class cheats on his quiz
2325336 student thank you for your guidance and not forgetting your lively classes
2325337 student last but not least i would like to thank you for being
2325338 student honestly i have learned a lot from this course not only in thinking but more than what i could describe here really enjoyed your class and the way you teach has definitely changed the way i looked at learning myself
2325339 tutor your forum 2 question is very interesting and the rules and regulations suggested are good that will make the students send in their answers earlier its nice having you as the course leader you are so efficient and informative
2325340 tutor i must let you know that i am very happy with your approach to the critical thinking course

2325346 at the university of california at berkeley the distinguished teaching award was instituted in 1959 to recognize and reward excellence in teaching
2325347 what were the least inspiring teachers we experienced during our student days
2325348 what were the teaching habits that inspired us out of learning
2325349 that student is an idiot i have told him a 100 times and he still doesnt get it
2325350 he who is humble is confident and wise he who brags is insecure and lacking
2325351 no student in my class has ever gotten an a
2325352 give us a break from your pathetic achievements and please get on with the class
2325353 develop success from failures discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success
2325354 its the way people depend on all those bells and whistles that come with the software to try to shore up a weak presentation
2325355 to critics powerpoint serves largely the same role in the classroom as pre processed snack food does in the lunchroom a conveniently packaged morsel that looks good but doesnt match the intellectual or corporeal nourishment of say a critical essay or a plate of steamed spinach
2325356 the practical conclusions are clear powerpoint is a competent slide manager and projector but rather than supplementing a presentation it has become a substitute for it such misuse ignores the most important rule of speaking respect your audience
2325357 the use of the powerpoint presentation has been a disaster it should be ditched
2325358 lecturers who know nothing else except their powerpoint slides they are just powerpoint notes not process they have no stories no biographies no histories
2325359 oh this part is easy you can read this at home
2325360 of course powerpoint is not inherently evil it is just poorly used
2325361 some people study all their life and at their death they have learned everything except to think
2325362 a person who asks questions is a person who thinks
2325363 who cares people on fear factor eat them alive all the time
2325364 no thinking required just need to look awake anyway i got the slides so there is no need to really listen

2325370 if at first the idea is not absurd there is no hope for it
2325371 the only thing that interferes with my learning is my education
2325372 your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning
2325373 education is the process in which we discover that learning adds quality to our lives learning must be experienced

2325375 if you dont fail at least 90 percent of the time youre not aiming high enough
2325376 the most important quality of a manager is his ability to lead people leadership comes from within and is not something one can easily teach it is about getting your staff excited motivated and inspired to action i have discovered that it is much more important to be a good leader than actually understand what you are doing if you are a good leader you can hire people that can teach you things from my experience the most successful companies are the ones where there is enormous conflict conflict does not mean killing one another but instead means there is a process by which there is a disagreement it is okay to have different points of views and disagree because tolerance for multiple opinions and people often leads to the right decision through some kind of process it is really the only way to deal with the high rate of change and continuous and disruptive innovation we find in the technology industry nothing in school prepares you for this that was the thing that really annoyed me the most in fact if you look in the computer industry every one of the successful companies is run by a real tough guy somewhere high up in the management chain who has established a tone of conflict a professional constructive conflict tone the benefits that you get from conflict from the standpoint of the company is the ability to compete innovate grow and make lot of money

2325383 here youll see which blogs are currently making an impact in the blogosphere the blogs you see here are all nominated and voted on by users like yourself
2325384 what the web 2 0 revolution is really delivering is superficial observations of the world around us rather than deep analysis shrill opinion rather than considered judgment
2325385 when ignorance meets egoism meets bad taste meets mob rule
2325386 history has proven that the crowd is not often very wise
2325387 the idea of objectivity is becoming increasingly pass in the relativistic realm of the web where bloggers cherry pick information and promote speculation and spin as fact whereas historians and journalists traditionally strived to deliver the best available truth possible many bloggers revel in their own subjectivity
2325388 democratized webs penchant for mash ups remixes and cut and paste jobs threaten not just copyright laws but also the very ideas of authorship and intellectual property
2325389 what you may not realize is that what is free is actually costing us a fortune the new winners google youtube myspace craigslist and the hundreds of startups hungry for a piece of the web 2 0 pie are unlikely to fill the shoes of the industries they are helping to undermine in terms of products produced jobs created revenue generated or benefits conferred by stealing away our eyeballs the blogs and wikis are decimating the publishing music and news gathering industries that created the original content those web sites aggregate our culture is essentially cannibalizing its young destroying the very sources of the content they crave
2325390 history has proven that the crowd is not often very wise
2325391 there is a danger of making ancient greek athletes superhuman ethical people but they were humans like us
2325392 as in modern sports most contests were honestly competed so i would say it was unusual but it happened
2325393 the winner simply took home a bunch of olive leaves but the pride was so great the home city would often give a cash handout to the athlete or free meals for a life time
2325394 sometimes when a scandal occurs it distorts the picture because the scandal is so shocking but some 90 percent of the athletic contests are honest i would say it was probably the same in ancient times
2325395 apparently nero wasnt the only one doing it but is that like taking vitamins is that like taking an illegal drug the distinction is not made
2325396 greatness in athletics doesnt mean you are a great human being

2325403 in the industry standard computing space a number of years ago we faced the challenge of what was going to happen with linux and the growth of open source and fundamentally we made a decision that business customers make rational business decisions and the reason they choose an open source product is because they can solve the problem better than they can with a windows based product so when you put it in those sorts of terms the way we compete against linux is very simple we build a better product and we have a great value proposition today our customers know linux isnt free and the overall cost of the solution is in fact in most cases quite a bit higher than a windows based solution and if we can offer a better solution at a great price then customers choose windows and they are so we are growing strongly

2325413 it is very discouraging to be in a team with white athletes on the track you are tommie smith the fastest man in the world but once you are in the dressing rooms you are nothing more than a dirty negro
2325414 it was in my head the whole year we first tried to have a boycott but not everyone was down with that plan a lot of athletes thought that winning medals would supercede or protect them from racism but even if you won the medal it aint going to save your momma it aint going to save your sister or children it might give you fifteen minutes of fame but what about the rest of your life im not saying that they didnt have the right to follow their dreams but to me the medal was nothing but the carrot on a stick
2325415 when we arrived at the award stand there was a lot of applause when we left there were many boos and thumbs down well john carlos and tommie smith want the people who booed to know that black people are not lower animals like roaches and rats were not like some sort of a show horse who does its job and then had some peanuts tossed at it wed like to tell all white people that if they dont care for things black people do they should not go see black people perform

2325428 to me its so simple that life should be lived on the edge of life you have to exercise in rebellion to refuse to taper yourself to rules to refuse your own success to refuse to repeat yourself to see every day every year every idea as a true challenge and then you are going to live your life on a tight rope

2325437 above 35 mph there is an external combustion system which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air
2325438 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
2325439 no ones really proven a six seater passenger car can get any better than 75 miles to the gallon so this would represent a big step forward
2325440 they would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the prius
2325441 that is above what you normally find even in an industrial setting
2325442 that takes quite a compressor to do it takes horsepower to compress the air up to that pressure
2325443 can win a stage race for clean production capable vehicles that exceed 100 mpg equivalent fuel economy

2325453 the most surprising thing is they robotic dogs worked almost equally well in alleviating loneliness and causing residents to form attachments

2325467 it means you can quite literally carry a small library in your pocket
2325468 sadly its unlikely to happen apple has the paid content side of the iphone sewn up tight if the itunes store started selling ebooks though things would start to get very interesting the troubles with the kindle are manifold its expensive you can only buy it in the us and it is bulky but with around six million iphone owners out there already plus an unknown number of ipod touch users the potential market for ebooks is huge this really could be the tipping point when electronic books go mainstream

2325534 at least i dont shell out 5 a cup at starbucks
2325535 what i dont like is the view of entitlement of if i am not going to play i am going to redshirt i think a redshirt is to be earned now
2325536 it is a different philosophy but just because a player is on the team for one year and doesnt play doesnt mean that that year is a year he is going to have back eligibility wise
2325537 since that tone has been set i like it and i think it prepares them more for the real world where you cant really take a year off and just be in an organization or on a team and expect it to be paid for
2325538 it was one thing on my part that i think organizationally we needed to change

2325548 lewiss association of thawra with a camel rising and generally with excitement and not with a struggle on behalf of values hints much more broadly than is usual for him that the arab is scarcely more than a neurotic sexual being each of the words or phrases he uses to describe revolution is tinged with sexuality stirred excited rising up but for the most part it is a bad sexuality he ascribes to the arab in the end since arabs are really not equipped for serious action their sexual excitement is no more noble than a camels rising up instead of revolution there is sedition setting up a petty sovereignty and more excitement which is as much as saying that instead of copulation the arab can only achieve foreplay masturbation coitus interruptus these i think are lewiss implications

2325682 economic conditions are declining rapidly leaving the country with some of the lowest incomes and highest prices in the region and an extreme vulnerability to high inflation
2325683 according to indicators such as from transparency international syria is now the fourth most corrupt country in the world
2325684 he can see that the democratic forces in this country have finally started to broaden their horizons are learning from anti dictatorial movements that have toppled regimes across the world primarily looking at the eastern european experience
2325685 the slope of improvement is now there even if it is minimal as we begin to tackle the serious problems of mobilization information and undermining the system
2325686 syria is not an alawite state as many have argued
2325687 the al assad family is alawite and there is an overrepresentation of them at the top of the system but most members of the government and even security establishment are actually sunni
2325688 george bush legitimized dictatorship across the middle east by the iraq war disaster
2325689 most syrians have now come to a grudging acceptance that assad represents a known and for the most part non lethal status quo bashars future politically looks very bright he has managed to neutralize most rivals the opposition is minimal and a great propaganda effort to get everyone onboard has taken place
2325690 the imf and the world bank estimate inflation is running at between 16 percent to 18 percent in a society with a large proportion of people on fixed state incomes those in liberal professions are ok but its the ones who actually work for the state who are in trouble
2325691 the main battles being fought inside damascus are over economic liberalization and how far to take the process
2325692 one of the main problems this opening up might lead to is for younger members of the syrian elite who have no managed to accrue vast wealth through corrupt or extensive patronage networks might become angry that they have missed out
2325693 in 2008 syria became a net importer of petrol for the first time in decades during a major oil shock he has been left will little choice but to update his economic framework this explains his movements westward as economics drives the politics
2325694 in answering the question of how strong or weak is bashar assad my answer is that he is as strong as former romanian dictator nicolai ceausescu when he met queen elizabeth ii on a state visit in the early 80s
2325695 syria will like an authoritarian state never have small problems it will either collapse utterly or continue that is the paradox of such a state structure they are both as strong as they appear and as weak as they fear
2325696 i appeal to you and through you to all other g8 leaders to support my new proposal that stolen crude should be treated like stolen diamonds because they both generate blood money
2325697 we stand ready to give help to the nigerians to deal with lawlessness that exists in this area and to achieve the levels of production that nigeria is capable of but because of the law and order problems has not been able to achieve
2325698 the oil belongs to us you cant steal what belongs to you
2325699 it is the government in abuja in collaboration with the oil companies that has been stealing our oil
2325700 weve focused more on transparency getting the governments and oil companies to publish what they pay
2325701 should gordon brown make good his threat to support this criminality for the sake of oil uk citizens and interests in nigeria will suffer the consequences
2325702 neither the nigerian government nor any foreign power can protect the oil wells or guarantee the continuous flow of oil from nigeria to the world market
2325703 only the people of the niger delta that can protect and guarantee both and britain should know where real power lies and support the people of the niger delta in order to resolve the problems
2325704 i dont care if he had twenty lovers and spent his life carousing but he did one thing right under him shanghai pulled itself forward and he was the only one to think about how to cover pensions in your country you can retire and know youve got something weve got nothing here he knew the only way to make any money was to put all the citys funds into property he was right its shot up in value but of course the central government hate this sort of independence i say if we ever get a half decent pension when we grow old itll be down to chen not those apes in beijing
2325705 as far as i know its all still there he hardly needs it now he never touched a penny of it
2325706 modern chinese city on olympic eve leads me to a prediction that during the games soon after the start and as long as there isnt some sort of unplanned spectacle the news will shift pretty quickly from all the politics to the usual rage and indignity of who wins and who loses and who has taken drugs and who hasnt in the sports events

2325710 of course our kids know not to talk or receive things from strangers
2325711 but i saw warmth in his eyes so we walked over to him
2325712 his few words nearly took our breath away because genas fathers name was also alan and he also had a very similar gentle and kind demeanor but her father had passed away six months earlier and still is missed so dearly
2325713 i dont think its a coincidence today that santa cruz means holy cross in spanish
2325714 ok dad you dont have to make it anymore obvious than this
2325715 nothing happens by chance it was meant for us to see him
2325716 its extremely helpful in some small way to counteract the incredibly negative attitude toward chronically homeless people on the streets

2325723 were honored to have him here hes really courageous people admire him and he commands a lot of respect
2325724 hes a warhorse he has so much vitality hes a robust guy hes a marvel
2325725 i want to open up the parameters of what we do i dont just want to do the classics as museum pieces
2325726 we are a classical theater but we are also an american company performing for an american audience i think its important to respect that in the repertory so that its not just a eurocentric festival
2325727 im not going to let anyone do twelfth night on mars but i do want to push the envelope i want to be a little dangerous i want to get in your face i would rather have people arguing on the way to the car than sitting back and applauding politely
2325728 hes really a unique beast in the years he was a company member at act what truly set him apart was the breadth of his vision
2325729 he is a consummate and delicious actor but he also always seemed to see the bigger picture he always helped me frame the discussion in a wider lens which is why he was so hungry to segue from the acting life to being an artistic director
2325730 you are very lucky to have marco there the thing about marco is that not only is he an extraordinary actor and director but he is also a wonderful teacher thats part of his nature i think he will find ways to teach us to enlighten us as well as entertain us
2325731 we are a lean mean machine there is not an extra penny here
2325732 i wake up every day living in a beautiful place with the best job anyone could want in this business with a supportive board and a great company of artists
2325733 we want our players to understand that its important to win nolan said
2325734 you can have the strongest leg in the world but if you dont kick it through the uprights
2325735 you can feel and see the emotion that goes on in a game and see how the guys respond to stressful situations nolan said
2325736 if youre a backup in this league and you have to switch gears to be the starter youre doing everybody a disservice osullivan said icily
2325737 youd be saying you werent ready to play when you were the backup
2325738 so things havent changed at all im preparing as hard as i can if they say for me to play the whole game ill play the whole game its that simple
2325739 its weird its definitely different said smith the no 1 overall draft pick in 2005
2325740 just trying not to get into it its just so easy to get sucked in and get angry all i can worry about are my reps
2325741 who needs a ged i got my b i b l e
2325742 we gotta get the hell outta you and endearing gags such as the interaction with the four piece backup combo and two hilarious takes on

2325744 im 100 percent sure theyll boo manny really bad aurilia said
2325745 not as bad as jeff but close to it any time you have a player of that caliber become part of a rivalry like this hell be automatically disliked
2325746 for the most part he couldnt care less he just wanted to play baseball
2325747 thats a different dodger ballclub over there manny makes them the team to beat definitely
2325748 hes an unbelievable hitter by all accounts the best right handed hitter in the game for the last 10 years
2325749 we wouldnt put up a christmas tree for years because i would get scared
2325750 he put a lizard in grandmas grocery bag and then chased her around the house with it
2325751 if you tell me what you want ill go get it for you
2325752 or it could be that he the assailant thought im losing this fight and shot him it was a pretty good struggle

2325758 anything that works to transport glucose into fat cells works to deposit fat
2325759 when insulin is secreted or chronically elevated fat accumulates in fat tissue
2325760 when insulin levels drop fat escapes from fat tissue and the fat depots shrink
2325761 i dont agree that the way to respond to this information is to eat a diet that is mostly meat and no carbohydrate
2325762 all carbohydrates are not the same nor do all people react to them in the same way
2325763 i invited gary to speak and ive been recommending the book to my medical colleagues and students its important to get this information out to the medical community because a lot of the ways that we try to prevent and treat obesity are based on assumptions that have no scientific evidence
2325764 the only thing that reliably does increase lifespan is caloric restriction cr cr is thought to work in great measure by decreasing the number of free radicals fired off in the mitochondria as a consequence of the mitochondria having less food that they have to process the mitochondria make their own antioxidants one of which is glutathione to help protect themselves from the free radicals they generate anything that increases the glutathione within the mitochondria is going to help increase longevity and decrease many of the ravages of disease many of which stem from excess mitochondrial free radical production this study indicates that a ketogenic diet significantly increases the production of glutathione within the mitochondria which is right where you want it
2325765 the nations pediatricians are recommending more aggressive use of cholesterol lowering drugs starting as early as the age of 8 in hopes of preventing adult heart problems
2325766 in a nut shell the author gary taubes claims that exercise doesnt work fat people stay fat and lean people stay lean all exercise does is burn a few calories then boost your appetite and make you want to eat more but theres a big problem with his analysis
2325767 theres a group at the university of cincinnati that did an atkins vs low fat study and they found that the atkins people lost twice as much weight and they liked the diet much better i was interviewing the dietitian who did the study she had agreed to talk to me but she was very hesitant she didnt offer up any information finally at the end of the interview the one thing she offered freely i asked her who funded it and she said the american heart association
2325768 i said well i have to give them credit for funding it
2325769 she said dont they funded it because we proposed it as a study that would refute the benefit and when we found that the atkins diet really worked and worked better than the low calorie diet now were trying to get money to look further into it and they wont give it to us
2325770 author gary taubes challenges common myths about obesity and explains why atkins might well have been right
2325771 you make claims in this book that counter everything we ve been told you argue that exercise has little or no effect on how much we weigh that fattening is not about how many calories we eat but what kind of calories we eat really
2325772 gary taubes who chronicles many of those mistakes in his new book good calories bad calories has some thoughts for lab readers on why researchers in nutrition obesity and chronic disease have gone wrong so often and why cascades occur so easily
2325773 gary taubes born april 30 1956 is an american science writer he is the author of nobel dreams 1987 bad science the short life and weird times of cold fusion 1993 and good calories bad calories 2007 he has won the science in society award of the national association of science writers three times and was awarded an mit knight science journalism fellowship for 1996 97

2325776 the added vigilance and active participation by our shoppers and retailers greatly magnifies the effectiveness of the program by placing eyes and ears everywhere
2325777 what i dont like is the view of entitlement of if i am not going to play i am going to redshirt i think a redshirt is to be earned now
2325778 it is a different philosophy but just because a player is on the team for one year and doesnt play doesnt mean that that year is a year he is going to have back eligibility wise
2325779 since that tone has been set i like it and i think it prepares them more for the real world where you cant really take a year off and just be in an organization or on a team and expect it to be paid for
2325780 it was one thing on my part that i think organizationally we needed to change
2325781 they will have to earn the redshirt year as a privilege which is what it is
2325782 it is one of the most significant and interesting sites discovered in cirencester we knew that there was important archaeology there as it is very close to the major road system of the roman town of cirencester
2325783 there are known to be a scatter of such farmsteads across the cotswold landscape but what is remarkable is the size of the settlement as it is quite large and the activity on it was unusual
2325784 this is one of the largest excavations in cirencester as it covers several hectares it seems to have been a settlement which went through various changes over time which is unusual
2325785 it may have been an area people came back to again and again and perhaps these materials were placed as some type of thanksgiving
2325786 certain irregularities about whether the bus was operating under the name angel tours or iguala busmex it is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a u s passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time
2325787 as being a high risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an fmcsa compliance review in may 2008 this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours operations out of service to date angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service
2325788 fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements
2325789 and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling not a safe feeling
2325790 i feel a little bit shaky but i just let myself at peace and then go to sleep
2325791 as i opened my eyes i see the chair falling off and i was sitting right below the tv and i felt that somebody was laying on my leg and then right next to me there was a lady she got her arm really crushed up and on top of her there was another lady she cannot move
2325792 in almost 20 years as a prosecutor and now as attorney general i cannot recall one case where someone has assaulted a police officer who was attempting to serve a subpoena

2325795 you want to watch me try on dresses at lunch
2325796 but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2325797 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption
2325798 efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
2325799 if our use of fossil fuels is increasing our reliance on middle eastern dictators while destroying the planet maybe we ought to use less
2325800 we can use those twisty carbon fluorescent light bulbs we can unplug our televisions computers and phone chargers when were not using them
2325801 its sad to see mccains campaign adopting the politics of the tire gauge promoting the fallacy that americans are powerless to address their own energy problems because the truth is yes we can
2325802 are the two members who couldnt even serve in the guard
2325803 hes probably got the most corporate memory right now of anybody on the budget
2325804 i came to sacramento to get things done and thats what my focus is and at the same time i really love people and have worked hard to build relationships
2325805 obviously from a philosophical perspective theres a bit of a distance between us but he has the ability to disagree without being disagreeable and is eminently fair in his approach to policy discussions
2325806 ive never seen john playing politics for the sake of politics
2325807 hes an honest person whos going to give you the straightforward perspective
2325808 john is easily one of the best politicians in the history of santa cruz
2325809 he not only takes on multibillion dollar structural deficits in california but also is willing to engage in issues like whether off leash dogs can continue to use the beach here in santa cruz
2325810 we have seven guys that can throw in the low 90s and we can mix in a lefty bret maddox of tracy who can throw off speed and really locate

2325816 my heroes are people like rita moreno sammy davis people who not only recorded music but they acted as well he says
2325817 we were friends and brothers before all of this stuff
2325818 its good to just do something that people enjoy hearing and give people a good time its just been a real blast weve all been hanging and chilling and kicking it so this is a great thing
2325819 hes been a valiant fighter hes kicking it in the rear
2325820 were so fortunate nas has the no 1 record in the country right now
2325821 theres no doubt he keeps rock the bells as current as anything
2325822 and i think its important that its coming from a conscious social or political perspective
2325823 well just see what rabbit we can pull out of the hat when were in the bay area

2325838 call him a racist in signs if you see him call him an injustice call him whatever you want to call him but in his face all the time
2325839 how do you deal with this kind of an injustice i wouldnt protest i dont believe in protesting i think it demonstrates the failure of representative government my answer to that problem is i want to empower you as a lawmaker dont rely on your elected officials
2325840 not to oppose error is to approve it and not to defend truth is to suppress it and indeed to neglect to confound evil men when we can do it is no less a sin than to encourage them

2325860 theres no disputing what this measure does first and foremost what it does is eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry in the state of california
2325861 we believe the attorney general has attempted to influence voters against this measure
2325862 it is our goal to ensure that voters have a fair opportunity to decide this measure for themselves on election day

2325879 what i did have was a passion for what i was doing helping girls by creating a forum to connect them to each other and show them that they are not alone
2325880 a magazine starring regular girls not celebrities or even models on the cover was a new concept and one that publishing experts had a hard time getting behind
2325881 just like anything new and unproven my ideas were met with a lot of skepticism they simply didnt believe ordinary girls could sell on newsstands
2325882 it was a relief to know that there were other girls out there exactly like me
2325883 i loved how discovery girls answered the questions that i was too afraid to ask or that older people in my life thought to be stupid or childish

2325901 and i think about uh us still being so dependent on foreign energy that uh that our economy is grinding to a halt
2325902 the rapid decline in winter perennial ice the past two years was caused by unusual winds
2325903 america uh is is no longer uh what it it could be what it once was
2325904 we have to walk 45 minutes to the closest shop selling chinese
2325905 were only guessing what 8 8 08 is going to bring
2325906 there was a pregnant lady all decked out in a wedding dress who fainted in line
2325907 the asian culture definitely is more attuned to astrology numerology and the good luck thing than western culture
2325908 i hope this isnt going to become a recurring national craze
2325909 and that next year we have to go through this again on 9 9 09
2325910 for chinese the lucky number eight represents getting rich like 7 7 7 in america
2325911 even the license plate on my car has 8 8 8 in hong kong if your house number has 8 8 8 in it you can sell it for more money
2325912 if they dont feel the chi is right they wont buy it
2325913 if youve got an address with sixes and eights six also being an auspicious number theyre very likely to embrace the property
2325914 a lot of the young people i see are highly educated and quite successful in technical fields and yet it seems very important to them
2325915 i had people who said if they could get the number changed they would purchase the property
2325916 he betrayed the trust of this young girl he betrayed the trust of the community
2325917 we hope the victim can get some closure out of this and heal the wounds he caused her
2325918 the only time you see this kind of kaleidoscope of american ethnicities and backgrounds is in a national picture its very different when you get down to the local level
2325919 this is a period where california has been a net exporter of college educated workers to the rest of the country and a big importer of college educated workers from the rest of the world
2325920 the downturn in the economy probably kick started the trend in folks leaving
2325921 if you look at the south its the same generations of white americans that have lived there for the past 300 to 400 years
2325922 here people come into the community and are more accepting theres a strong latino culture here a strong vietnamese culture here and those two cultures are more dominant than any of the traditional cultures
2325923 its just all silicon valley lets make money and be happy
2325924 the only thing i ever hear from the whites is i just wish they would spend more time learning english thats the only complaint i ever hear
2325925 i have had comments made on the recent issue with the vietnamese community little saigon you know let it go youre making too big of an issue out of it
2325926 until the legislature sends me a budget i can sign i will not sign any bills that reach my desk
2325927 the only thing that the legislature should be focusing on is reaching a budget compromise immediately
2325928 this is the worst budget system in the united states
2325929 many of the bills the legislature passes do more harm than good
2325930 another distraction that wont have much impact other than the possible veto of public policy that moves our state forward
2325931 i just try to move the process forward and bring the parties together
2325932 everyone has to make compromises in order to meet in the middle
2325933 we made a mistake were human were sorry we will make mistakes in the future but we will always correct them so that you know you can trust us
2325934 so you think you can dance when it comes to our area
2325935 nous identifions des risques la baisse depuis un certain nombre de mois et je dirais que les informations notre disposition sugg rent clairement la mat rialisation de ces risques
2325936 je suis surpris que trichet ait conc d que la croissance serait si faible en milieu dann e alors que les taux ont t relev s en juillet
2325937 les donn es les plus r centes pointent vers un affaiblissement de la croissance la mi 2008
2325938 le virage est difficile n gocier pour jean claude trichet et ses coll gues de la bce comment reconna tre que la r cession est aux portes de la zone euro sans se d dire de leur r cente strat gie et de leurs pr c dentes d clarations sur la vigueur de la croissance eurolandaise
2325939 la bce essaie de pr parer les march s un revirement de sa position dici lautomne
2325940 eighty six percent of chinese people surveyed said they were content with the countrys direction up from 48 percent in 2002 and 82 percent of chinese were satisfied with their national economy up from 52 percent
2325941 russians were the third most satisfied people with their countrys direction at 54 percent despite western concerns about authoritarian trends
2325942 since we have the bible why do we have the book of concord the lutheran confessions are a summary and explanation of the bible they are not placed over the bible they do not take the place of the bible the book of concord is how lutherans are able to say together as a church this is what we believe this is what we teach this is what we confess the reason we have the book of concord is because of how highly we value correct teaching and preaching of gods word
2325943 conor oberst but the record which comes out this week mingles folk rock country pop and rootsy rock to land not too far from bright eyes broad turf
2325944 chorus again or another one this is flying by the seat of the pants in the spirit of the replacements and by using this take rather than a proper performance oberst helps set the records freewheeling tone
2325945 a cruel and elaborate hoax as he did on the last bright eyes album
2325946 cassadaga oberst generates a sense of constant physical and psychic motion plotting his journey with geographical detail
2325947 i think with this years rock the bells itll be a very communal vibe says festival founder chang weisberg 34
2325948 last year there was a lot of angst when you have rage playing its pretty serious im just happy that no one died
2325949 you get to see them and hang out and catch up
2325950 my heroes are people like rita moreno sammy davis people who not only recorded music but they acted as well he says
2325951 we were friends and brothers before all of this stuff
2325952 its good to just do something that people enjoy hearing and give people a good time its just been a real blast weve all been hanging and chilling and kicking it so this is a great thing
2325953 hes been a valiant fighter hes kicking it in the rear
2325954 were so fortunate nas has the no 1 record in the country right now
2325955 theres no doubt he keeps rock the bells as current as anything
2325956 and i think its important that its coming from a conscious social or political perspective
2325957 well just see what rabbit we can pull out of the hat when were in the bay area
2325958 a lot of fans had to pay dues waiting for us to give them the full experience
2325959 were just so appreciative of bay area fans for being patient letting the show grow and morph into an annual hip hop experience
2325960 les chinois risquent de percevoir le monde comme un mauvais invit leurs jeux olympiques de nombreux chinois sont extr mement fiers de ce quils consid rent comme une magnifique r ussite nationale et de l mergence symbolique de leur nation sur la sc ne mondiale un bon nombre dentre eux prouveraient un ressentiment tenace si les opinions ext rieures taient toutes uniquement n gatives pour de nombreux chinois les jeux seront leur premi re exp rience du monde ext rieur cette intervention dans une soci t autrefois ferm e ne peut quencourager une plus grande ouverture et libert et cet h ritage ne sera pas r prim facilement lorsque les jeux seront termin s de la m me fa on cest frustrant et pour certains exaltant de reconna tre que dans 17 jours toutes les discussions propos des prochains jeux olympiques porteront sur londres qui peut dire aujourdhui quelles discussions fi vreuses envahiront latmosph re londonienne dans quatre ans mais pour p kin la longue attente vient de se terminer laissons les jeux commencer
2325961 lattribution des jeux olympiques la chine est un scandale dont les fonctionnaires du comit olympique sont responsables leur affirmation selon laquelle ils ne pourraient pas simmiscer dans la politique est cynique et mensong re le respect des droits de lhomme est une norme universelle de la civilisation europ enne qui nest justement pas appliqu e par les communistes et les fascistes nous ne condamnons pas les sportifs qui participent aux jeux olympiques car ce ne sont pas eux qui ont choisi le lieu o ils se d roulent mais nous exprimons notre m contentement l gard de tous les politiques qui par leur pr sence p kin en d pit de leurs d clarations orales cautionnent un etat dictatorial nous voulons surtout exprimer notre solidarit envers toutes les personnes qui en chine sont priv es de leur libert et de leurs droits fondamentaux nous sommes persuad s que toute dictature doit tre condamn e m me si elle se trouve dans un etat puissant
2325962 je pense que ce qui a t dit et fait lann e derni re peut avoir un effet durable lassouplissement de la position de p kin par rapport un engagement international au darfour pour viter le risque dun boycott g n ral qui an antirait la f te en est un exemple tr s probant selon moi tous les regards qui se sont tourn s vers la chine qui en temps normal se seraient port s vers dautres directions rev tent une importance encore plus grande cest pourquoi il nest plus possible de parler du miracle conomique chinois sans parler en m me temps des probl mes des droits de lhomme et de la destruction de lenvironnement pour tous le revers de la m daille est devenu beaucoup plus visible quavant cest le tribut des jeux olympiques que les dirigeants chinois ne sattendaient pas payer lorsquils ont appris dans la joie et lall gresse que les jeux taient attribu s p kin
2325963 en tant quactuel pr sident du conseil de lue nicolas sarkozy aurait il vraiment d carter si rapidement tout doute et promettre sa pr sence symbolique la c r monie douverture la majorit des fran ais ne partage pas vraiment cet avis et ceci est certainement d au fait quaucune des conditions que sarkozy avait auparavant exig es de p kin na t remplie notamment en ce qui concerne la question du tibet et rappelons nous galement quapr s des d bats passionn s au parlement europ en sarkozy avait d cid de prendre avec lui une liste de prisonniers politiques peine perdue

2325965 how many movies and shows are out there for us this is a great excuse for women to get together an excuse to celebrate
2325966 my daughter and i have seen mamma mia three times and we cannot wait to go again
2325967 each time we have gone with a group of girls when it comes to the movie theaters we will attend with friends again and wear our feather boas too
2325968 the biggest pleasure for me is getting to share the show with other women and girls
2325969 its not just uplifting its also contagious i love that by the end of the show everyone loves it as much as i do
2325970 we were finally able to make choices for ourselves and contributions to society that did not depend on whether or not to raise a family
2325971 there is still something heroic and triumphant about this breakthrough something that to me is an undercurrent in the mamma mia story
2325972 i am 56 years old and i am the dancing queen
2325973 i have been doing my housework to abbas music for years
2325974 i dont really care who is playing what part im not really into that i just want to be there on opening night i want to be one of the first people to see it

2325976 when he first got there not only could he not swim but he used a kickboard and he was actually going backward
2325977 he grabbed my shoulder harder than in the beginning and i thought this is not good
2325978 he was bobbing in and out of the water and then we were both going down a bit
2325979 for him to sacrifice that goal and stop and help another athlete he still wound up not being the last out of the water
2325980 because periyakoil wasnt a strong swimmer it made him aware and more empathetic to the situation
2325981 i just think that during a race so many people are focused on themselves
2325982 kas took time out of his race to help somebody else it just shows the kind of guy he is
2325983 despite that he was still out there a lot of people would have quit at that point
2325984 its an honor to be with people like that and coach them i get more kicks from someone like him than seeing someone on a podium
2325985 i know you guys speak english and i do thank you for making me feel welcome but please go ahead and speak portuguese because i really want to learn
2325986 what i am doing i am going to why am i going to because
2325987 a big part of this case has been gearing up for the trials of the high value detainees
2325988 nobody will say they are small fry and in each of those cases the government will be seeking the death penalty
2325989 this was a case of a fair minded panel of military officers operating in a fundamentally unfair system
2325990 the fact that the military officers performed their duties conscientiously does not make fair a system which allows the use of coerced evidence is designed to cover up abuse and disregards basic due process protections
2325991 this has been the most amazing thing of my life
2325992 its opened me up to all the different styles and what kind of dancer i want to be i cant thank everyone enough
2325993 all along the way from san jose to l a and on the way back again

2325998 a school principal turned hospice volunteer frances shani parker relates her experiences with dying people in nursing homes the second part of the book is about what we as individuals and as a society must do to improve things for those who are dying i particularly enjoyed the guided tour conducted from a wheelchair of baby boomer haven
2325999 youre ninety nine and youll be a hundred years old on your next birthday
2326000 a hundred years old is too old i dont think i want to be that old
2326001 there are three other ladies in this nursing home who are older than that one is a hundred three we talked to her last week during your wheelchair ride
2326002 how much longer will it be before i make a hundred i dont know if i want to wait too much longer
2326003 its only one more month i remember you said you had spiritual talks with your minister if you decide to wait ill get you a big balloon that looks like a birthday cake
2326004 i guess i could wait yes i think i will wait that way i can celebrate my hundredth birthday when i do get to heaven i can tell everybody i lived to be one hundred

2326007 but my mother who was a simple housewife she showed me the snake when i was a child
2326008 how dare this man come in here and name a snake after his wife
2326009 it gives the impression that people here depend on people from abroad to come and show us things in our own backyard
2326010 probably people have overreacted its nationalism going a bit awry
2326011 we regret having to make any changes but we think these by and large will have minimal reader impact
2326012 but when revenues are decreasing we have to find ways to respond to that weve tried to be as thoughful and careful as possible

2326016 some experts are calling this year the worst the newspaper industry has ever seen up to now the jackson market has been good to us its overall health has enabled us to operate with virtually the same level of staffing while other newspapers have gone through the job elimination process multiple times we can no longer shield ourselves from the economic reality of the times
2326017 the shares of seven publicly held newspaper companies today plunged to the ir lowest point in modern history
2326018 for some reason they assume people will want to buy more newspapers if they have less news in them and are less useful
2326019 doubt can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty
2326020 were creating chances and were good going forward its just the defensive side of things we need to sort out
2326021 were just conceding silly goals which we dont normally do but were going to try to get that sorted out its been a wee bit of a concern
2326022 attackings not a problem the strikers are getting the goals theyre all trying to stake a claim in the team
2326023 it makes it harder for decisions when it comes to the lineup on a saturday but thats what you want
2326024 shaun played at the back alongside jimmy fingland and did well keiran came on in the second half and did well on the right hand side
2326025 there are certain games where we can play them and that was the ideal game

2326048 we look at the work of others not because we want to copy it
2326049 but because we want to take away the best aspects of each casino computer programmer volunteers design and apply them to our own work
2326050 ive been a student of casino computer programmer volunteers design for almost 20 years now
2326051 and i cant say ive ever been more excited than now our new director chhour brevik promises to bring things to a much higher level and increase our output i realize this will mean more casino computer programmer volunteers design hours but this also means more money for all of us
2326052 the use of computers in our firm has accounted for a five fold increase in productivity quality and sales volume computers allow our casino computer programmer volunteers design specialists a much a higher degree of efficieny and output furthermore since we can make more with less our overhead decreases dramatically and profits will skyrocket
2326053 i know there is no such thing as a quick buck but in 5 years when this casino computer programmer volunteers industry blossoms were going to see a lot of new rich people
2326054 the key to working on good casino computer programmer volunteers design pieces is patience and rote talent
2326055 like many of our employees i started with classical art training and drawing and slowly moved into the post modern area this succession greatly improved my casino computer programmer volunteers art and drawing skills
2326056 this means a lot to me personally weve worked so hard in this industry for years and finally it is starting to pay off big
2326057 the fact that most of todays up and coming designers have never used charcoal and a pad of paper doesnt bother me in the least
2326058 because as interest and corporate demand for casino computer programmer volunteers art grows so will the talent base were going to see some great work from some of the top up and coming names in the business

2326064 some people want to ignore the war it isnt pleasant it isnt great people want to put it out of sight out of mind
2326065 i spent some time in the army when i was drafted in 68
2326066 i know how i felt during that time that no one gives a damn i left my job for two years and i felt like nobody cared no one was aware of the sacrifice
2326067 a war has never been viewed as a glorified mission however our national security is at stake and well take every measure necessary to ensure that our safety is not compromised
2326068 i can speak firsthand to the progress weve had progress that not many are willing to acknowledge the simple fact is that the surge was successful and we have a commitment to the iraqi people to finish the job
2326069 the sign represents freedom of speech and honors those killed in iraq
2326070 we wanted it to create thought and discussion it will be there until the war is over

2326105 there was so much roar from the water rushing its amazing the fire department heard the screams

2326107 its going to affect tourism for the rest of the summer
2326108 the roads that have been closed are quite severely damaged
2326109 our big concern now is that potentially we are not out of this
2326110 we thrive in markets that are overdeveloped and overdeveloped markets always have people that are struggling or underperforming we dont really care because were not the chamber of commerce but the more people there are in the market the better it is for us because we take the top end of that business i would prefer that our neighbors be successful but their success is not entirely relevant to our own performance
2326111 i dont want to be too sophisticated here but 2007 is going to suck all 12 months of the calendar year
2326112 although the vasimr could operate with waste hydrogen gas from the space station no connections to this supply are planned for the experiment hydrogen is the primary choice for propellant but deuterium and helium are also of interest and might also be included
2326113 were likely to find hydrogen pretty much anywhere we go in the solar system what this means is that a vasimr powered spacecraft could be launched with only enough fuel to get to its destination such as mars and then pick up more hydrogen upon arrival to serve as fuel for the return trip home another benefit of hydrogen fuel is that hydrogen is the best known radiation shield so the fuel for the vasimr engine could also be used to protect the crew from harmful effects of radiation exposure during the flight
2326114 see see surrogacy keeps that mother child bond from happening to the parent to be
2326115 this is another reason why people shouldnt be exploiting the wombs of poor indian women
2326116 there is a legal complication as the father is alone and indian adoption law says a single male cant adopt a girl
2326117 yamada went to the local passport office he was told to go to the japanese embassy which asked him to get a document from an indian court to get custody of the child

2326119 the surrogacy doesnt matter he is after all the biological father
2326120 the baby is alright but the grandmother is very tense

2326126 there is actually a lot of water in the northern basin and the government has a golden opportunity to buy that water
2326127 given the current level of storage its not feasible to refill the lakes by transferring water from other parts of the basin without any further significant rain
2326128 we note that murray darling basin commission figures released yesterday show that up to 80 per cent of water would be lost in transmission between the northern basin and the lower lakes
2326129 the water is available but we need the political will
2326130 that shooting increased the awareness of security for government employees and buildings

2326134 it appears debi farr was against abortion in cases of rape and incest before she was for it
2326135 two years ago when she faced a weaker opponent she said she was against legalized abortion now that she faces a tough race she supports a womans right to choose
2326136 voters are tired of politicians like debi farr who say one thing and then turn around and do another or who change their positions just to score political points
2326137 the main issue here is debi farrs honesty when it comes to an important issue like abortion and womens health care
2326138 on issue after issue debi farr campaigns like a moderate or even a democrat but turns around and votes like a conservative republican in 2005 debi farr had one of the most partisan voting records voting the republican party line 99 of the time
2326139 well um that was an interesting letter to the editor because i didn t sit on that committee so i didn t have a vote so i didn t have a vote on that committee and that bill didn t ever come to the house floor for a vote
2326140 patent lies should never be part of the political process hi this is debi farr and my opponent has engaged in the worst type of campaigning he and his supporters have stated that i would never support the womans right to choose let me be perfectly clear in cases of rape incest or life of the mother i will always support the womans right to choose period this is debi farr and i am asking for your support

2326150 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2326151 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2326152 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2326153 he just thought he was better than anybody else and he could do anything and there was no way to stop him
2326154 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2326155 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2326156 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2326157 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2326158 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2326159 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2326160 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2326161 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2326162 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2326163 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2326164 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2326165 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2326166 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2326167 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2326168 im looking forward to teaching her stuff like how to ride a bike and speak words
2326169 it was awesome to see her laugh and smile and just to see her for real instead of just a picture of her
2326170 into the second day we were able to take her outside and i was swinging her in my arms which made her giggle
2326171 every night at dinner we pray that shes had a good day the lord will watch over her and her caregivers and let her know that we are coming back for her
2326172 we thrive in markets that are overdeveloped and overdeveloped markets always have people that are struggling or underperforming we dont really care because were not the chamber of commerce but the more people there are in the market the better it is for us because we take the top end of that business i would prefer that our neighbors be successful but their success is not entirely relevant to our own performance
2326173 i dont want to be too sophisticated here but 2007 is going to suck all 12 months of the calendar year

2326175 i dont want to be too sophisticated here but 2007 is going to suck all 12 months of the calendar year
2326176 im afraid if we wait we may have lost our window of opportunity

2326183 i expected him to escape while i was in having a shower
2326184 you engaged in a dangerous practice and he was clearly bound too tightly and he was not supervised
2326185 investigations like this one that include targeting the illegal financing of organised criminal syndicates involved in the global trade in illicit drugs are proving highly successful and ensure an economic as well as social return for the community
2326186 this is an extraordinary outcome for law enforcement as it continues to work together to detect illicit drugs before they reach australia
2326187 international intelligence combined with the cooperation of local law enforcement agencies played a big role in the success of the operation
2326188 the volume of the seizure indicates that international syndicates saw australia as a potentially fertile market we hope that impression has well and truly been smashed mr mcclelland said in sydney
2326189 one benefit of this seizure is to send a very clear message to these drug syndicates that australia is not a soft target that our law enforcement authorities are as good or if not better than any in the world and they smugglers face very serious criminal consequences
2326190 these changes will enable anz to offer our customers some very competitive fixed rates
2326191 we would like to cut those interest rates but we will have to assess what is happening to our funding costs at that time
2326192 those short term funding costs have moved from an average of 10 basis points over the official cash rate to earlier this year to 100 points to last week 60 to yesterday 20
2326193 for me faith has always been synonymous with good works i was taught that the christian values of compassion charity and honesty are a way of serving god through serving others serving our community is the cornerstone of my campaign i will do more then speak out for these values i will advance them

2326201 there are differences between the synods i admit but i also know that there is a considerable unity between the els and lc ms when it comes to proclaiming the gospel
2326202 there is difference in some areas of practice i can remember when there was some sort of an impasse at my church in des moines someone suggested that st louis be consulted with an answer
2326203 i said that the difference between a norwegian synod church and a missouri synod church was that the germans looked to st louis for an answer while a norwegian opened his bible read it and then tried to resolve the problem with sanctified christian common sense
2326204 de symptomen zijn wel heel duidelijk dat dit slik probleem er een is geboren vanuit een van je vorige levens een arts kan geen hulp bieden want naar mijn mening helpen pilletjes en zalfjes niet nee naar mijn visie ben je in een vorig leven opgehangen geweest om je extravagante spirituele gedachten mensen van 100 tot 200 jaar geleden hadden niet zoveel op met het paranormale en het spirituele

2326242 the problem is that just 17 percent of dentists statewide have been willing to see these newly insured patients despite reforms intended to boost their ranks even some of these dentists are limiting the number of state subsidized patients they will treat
2326243 as part of the healthcare law the state changed a rule to encourage dentists to treat at least some patients covered by commonwealth care or its medicaid program called masshealth

2326327 when the peoples republic of china was announced coming into the stadium in los angeles it changed our games
2326328 ninety thousand people stood and cheered from all parts of the world they were welcoming china into the olympic movement
2326329 they will mean a lot for the rest of the world to discover what china really is to discover a country which for most people is mysterious
2326330 they will see a country with a history and a tradition and a culture of 5 000 years
2326331 i clearly expect them to be the dominant team in the olympic games for many many years to come
2326332 this is not just investing in a few athletes for a short period of time and hope they have success while you host the games the results of this type of investment and this type of system is going to garner them results in 2012 2016 and beyond

2326352 rick just cracked up they knew then that he could communicate
2326353 rick told us he just didnt feel handicapped when we were competing
2326354 what i mean when i say i feel like i am not handicapped when competing is that i am just like the other athletes and i think most of the athletes feel the same way in the beginning nobody would come up to me however after a few races some athletes came around and they began to talk to me during the early days one runner pete wisnewski had a bet with me at every race on who would beat who the loser had to hang the winners number in his bedroom until the next race now many athletes will come up to me before the race or triathlon to wish me luck
2326355 nobody wanted rick in a road race everybody looked at us nobody talked to us nobody wanted to have anything to do with us but you cant really blame them people often are not educated and theyd never seen anyone like us as time went on though they could see he was a person he has a great sense of humor for instance that made a big difference
2326356 and i hadnt been on a bike since i was six years old
2326357 rick is the one who inspires and motivates me the way he just loves sports and competing
2326358 dad is one of my role models once he sets out to do something dad sticks to it whatever it is until it is done for example once we decided to really get into triathlons dad worked out up to five hours a day five times a week even when he was working
2326359 some people have turned out some in good shape some really out of shape and they say we want to thank you because were here because of you
2326360 whenever we are passed usually on the bike the athlete will say
2326361 if not for you we would not be out here doing this
2326362 people just need to be educated rick is helping many other families coping with disabilities in their struggle to be included
2326363 in restaurants and its only older people mostly theyll see ricks food being pushed out of his mouth and theyll leave or change their table but i have to say that kind of intolerance is gradually being defeated
2326364 on the day of the marathon from hopkinton to boston people all over the course were wishing me luck and they had signs up which read congratulations on your graduation
2326365 the message of team hoyt is that everybody should be included in everyday life

2326371 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
2326372 no matter how deep i am in this fight no matter
2326373 they are into their personal style more than ever before and trying to get the deals at the store before everyone else does
2326374 i love fashion and look in both high end and discount stores for my clothes
2326375 when people ask me what my personal style is i think of two words nautical and preppy nautical is west coast and preppy is east coast and my style is what happens when they meet ive noticed looking through my favorite fashion magazines that there are no longer back to school articles on the look theyre more on your look my favorite thing about fashion is that it is the best way to express yourself so whether your style is preppy boho sporty or skater the only fall look this year is to express your individual style as creatively as you can
2326376 stand out a lot and can go together with anything
2326377 every teenage girl knows that the peer pressure can really make you want to dress like the popular teens the thing is they dress like everybody else shopping at huge clothing stores i like to take a turn in fashion so i dont look like every other teen in the school so that means avoiding the usual mall stores most of my shopping is done at recycled clothing stores i like to keep my style colorful and girly but i like to show my sporty side occasionally you need to be comfortable so i dress to impress but also make sure im comfy i love to design clothes and i try to sew my designs but my sewing skills arent too hot yet
2326378 if we do one thing right well do something else wrong
2326379 i just kind of seized in the heat of the moment
2326380 it was one of those situations where i tried to do too much
2326381 it just seems right now that things are not going our way
2326382 weve got to keep fighting through it until they do
2326383 put his numbers against anyone in baseball and theyre right there if not better
2326384 we knew that was a big inning and he was facing the heart of the order said giants manager bruce bochy noting that lincecum didnt have his best stuff
2326385 he has a way to elevate when he has to
2326386 hes not a thrower out there he was trying to hit spots not power his way through them
2326387 im 100 percent every pitch but im not trying to throw my arm out like people say he said
2326388 i didnt want him to give up a home run on something hanging said molina who called a fastball away
2326389 he felt confident that he could throw a good slider there so thats great i dont mind that
2326390 when he falls behind in the count you think theyll have a good swing but they dont the catcher said
2326391 to me thats what makes him so good he doesnt give in he makes them earn their swings and their hits
2326392 you cant try to hit home runs in this ballpark thats for sure rowand said
2326393 no matter how deep i am in this fight no matter how
2326394 theyre free to get in but youve got to pay 75 quid to get out
2326395 i never dissed him theres no point in going on about it because you end up sounding like heather mills
2326396 the whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the pc the game looks and plays beautifully on pc and we cant wait for people to play it
2326397 im a full blown linebacker have been for a while now
2326398 vic has matured and been through a lot of things here at byu
2326399 and this is the first time since he arrived on campus i have seen the kind of bounce in his step and a light in his eyes where he is really looking forward to the season and thats been fun
2326400 it has been a lot easier i feel more like i am playing football now i feel like i can make a play on every play so thats what i try to do
2326401 hes doing well in practice but obviously game speed is a whole different thing
2326402 he hasnt played a game yet at outside linebacker but i am more than confident that he will be able to fill in just fine and hell adjust to that game speed
2326403 i like his work ethic and i like his enthusiasm he hasnt been like this since he was a true freshman so we found the right place for him its a good move
2326404 the european market has been growing year by year and its certainly been a hope of ours that it would become a viable alternative for players
2326405 the luxury tax in the nba has put a crimp on what teams can spend so players are looking for alternatives
2326406 in fact we see this as a positive indication of how popular the sport of basketball is on a global basis
2326407 italy greece russia 40 million a year yeah im there as simple as that
2326408 if it happens it happens id be surprised if it did with players of that calibre
2326409 but certainly we would deal with it if it happened and i continue to think that the nba will be the gold standard for the top players in the world for a long time to come
2326410 it just shows you what a global game basketball is that there are good leagues and leagues that are willing to pay for high calibre talent
2326411 the more money they get the better they feel about the commitment
2326412 without there being a players association and a collective bargaining agreement in europe theres nothing behind the contract to enforce them other than to go to court
2326413 for europe to truly get to the point where they can compete with the nba for all kinds of players theyre going to have to implement a system where theres a lot more comfort that the contracts are truly guaranteed once that happens then i think youll truly see great competition for players
2326414 we could have came to an agreement last year so i think thats the window of opportunity for a lot of teams

2326419 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody should have told him im a fuckin rock star
2326420 today is gonna be the day that im gonna throw it back to you
2326421 i wasnt saying i was better than jay z as a person or rock was greater than hip hop
2326422 i said what i said and it was wrong or it was taken wrong and now all this media furore
2326423 jay z said recently wonderwall is always the last song of the night at his restaurant in new york
2326424 ill have a beer with him one day and it will be fine
2326425 glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music im not having hip hop at glastonbury its wrong
2326426 i wasnt saying i was better than jay z as a person or rock was greater than hip hop as a thing or whatever it is
2326427 i said what i said and it was wrong or it was taken as wrong and now all this
2326428 my single went back in the charts profile went through the roof everyones a winner
2326429 he knows that i was misrepresented as i guess he was so lets move on
2326430 for my own part i can sit here and say i never dissed that guy i never would
2326431 but theres no point in going on about it because you end up sounding like heather mills i said this
2326432 he made sure he was winding that thing as fast as he could and it was an eye opener for us
2326433 the biggest challenge is going to be when you throw the deep ball that is incomplete and that guy has to catch his breath and get back to the huddle as fast as he can
2326434 there is no question the length of games in college football have been a hot topic
2326435 weve been trying to find the right balance for a couple years
2326436 to me thats an even greater reason for this change
2326437 it eliminates that element based on the pace of the referee
2326438 we have a lot of weapons we have to play with more discipline so we can win the close games but i definitely think weve made a big improvement over last season
2326439 we know that this is a business when it comes to coach guy and we know that weve got to go out and make more plays than we did last season
2326440 there might be a very similar thing happen tomorrow that happened today and eventually they will learn what scrimmage tempo means and what team tempo means
2326441 stanford and north carolina state are really high on him
2326442 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2326443 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
2326444 right now we have over 12 million users in over 26 countries with 240 million in transactions revenue so far with 180 million in the last 12 months alone
2326445 on average titles that have downloadable content on xbl marketplace have seen a 16 percent longer period of people holding onto that title which keeps them from selling to secondhand stores
2326446 if we do one thing right well do something else wrong
2326447 i just kind of seized in the heat of the moment
2326448 it was one of those situations where i tried to do too much
2326449 it just seems right now that things are not going our way
2326450 weve got to keep fighting through it until they do
2326451 this is the fourth time actually its a pretty draining process this is new territory for everybody
2326452 there were the national championships the u s trials then the selection camp and paul and now here its been crazy
2326453 its an honor to be on this team but its a shame that it had to happen this way
2326454 its a tough position to be in but dave and i worked really hard we pushed each other because we have to stay in shape
2326455 but its something that is to the point where my ankle is shutting down and its not responding to what im telling it to do as a result i cant do my gymnastics especially not safely
2326456 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down
2326457 my thoughts and prayers are with the edwards family today and thats all ive got to say
2326458 a debate has swirled over whether media outlets were protecting the former senator either out of bias toward a democrat or sympathy for his wife
2326459 shakes the public persona of a man whose image was deeply linked to his role as a devoted husband

2326527 but youre a full time cyclist itll be easy to pack
2326528 but i think it works pretty well as contemporary theater music there are real melodies and extremely sharp and witty lyrics the central concept is pretty irresistible at least to me it is
2326529 its a good time and its satirical without being mean spirited whats not to love
2326530 were so excited about bringing a whole new group of folks into the theater
2326531 particularly in times like these its great to have a show that pokes fun but also makes everybody feel good this is a very sweet show
2326532 people are thinking about the way religion impacts our lives it seems to me religion has a lot to do with the fierceness with which the world is now waging war if there is a god he she should be laughing to keep from crying at the irony of the current world situation
2326533 youve got to ask yourself what are they biting on
2326534 the feeling im getting these days is that people dont want to see long days journey into night you dont have to hit people with heavy introspection when theyre living in darkness youve got to hit them with some light
2326535 ive never seen a production of vanya where you can tell they are on a farm near says during a break in rehearsals
2326536 chekhov could have set this in an office but he didnt i wanted to capture that sense of farm life i saw what the country life did to my parents the loneliness the isolation the pettiness of provincial life
2326537 still life has always freelanced here and there of course but this is the first time in a long time that she has been free to be an artistic gypsy

2326542 i dont call them every day or go down there but if they need me im there
2326543 ive dealt with 21 years of challenges now its time for the people in charge to decide
2326544 timi is largely responsible for the reps artistic dna says rep managing director nick nichols
2326545 the way that we approach the art the importance we put on supporting nurturing and valuing all our artists is just the way we work and that attitude and approach is timis
2326546 change is easy to say and hard to do near says
2326547 san jose rep is a theater in the midst of rebuilding itself and it is wide open to change it is an exciting time for someone to come in and shape the rep to their artistic vision
2326548 you have to be tenacious your primary goal is what goes on stage yes youve got to work with the managing director and youve got to balance the budget but you have to keep your eyes on the prize thats the job
2326549 vanya in which a family steeps in its own regrets wistfully pondering what might have been echo keenly with near at this stage in the drama of her life
2326550 that sounds new age y but youve got to be true to yourself in life so that when you look back on what you did years later you dont have any regrets you have to look for fulfillment

2326561 we will work to recover that recorder but we cant guarantee its condition because of the extensive fire damage and that may unfortunately limit its usefulness

2326564 the innovation nation white paper published earlier this year sets out the governments goal to make the uk the best place in the world to run a creative innovative business we live in a world where open innovation the exchange of ideas knowledge and intellectual property is becoming the way in which businesses develop and build new products
2326565 the goal is to teach them skills that will help them survive in their community
2326566 we put them on a college campus and show them that they can go to college
2326567 they have to know whats out there so they can make a choice for themselves
2326568 if you dont change things dont expect things to change
2326569 i met a friend who made me realize that you should be glad every day that youre alive and make the most of it thats a powerful message
2326570 i started wondering why i was living at all then i remembered the stuff from the training
2326571 coming back here really helped me get a perspective on my life
2326572 i realized im not the only one with problems and i didnt have it as bad as a lot of people

2326576 i really believe its the most important thing i did in my teaching career
2326577 our turnover among teachers and administrators is so frequent in this state
2326578 its where people learn to live together in freedom and respect
2326579 i tell him whatever he stole from that church he should give it back lansford said
2326580 when you dont get results you try to fix something or go out of your zone lansford said
2326581 he has really sound swing mechanics when hes disciplined and swings at strikes hes a really good hitter
2326582 i tell him when you chase the ball you really stink
2326583 in the four years i spent there when you see all the things they did i kind of learned from it they traded mark mulder and tim hudson they like to have young talent i think the reason their young guys have success is they always relax
2326584 he said it was going to be good for me
2326585 that the as are a team that gives young guys an opportunity and how this was going to be important for my career
2326586 that guys been there forever he knows how to win hes like a role model for all of those guys over there
2326587 cios increasingly view enterprise portals as a key element in strategies ranging from soa to web 2 0 so they naturally seek to minimize product and vendor risk
2326588 however procurement managers and technology leaders who ultimately make product adoption decisions should understand that some of the biggest names in this business are undergoing substantial transformation that will lead to shifting roadmaps and product sets over the next few years
2326589 he went to the public american and european and promised to pledge his assets as collateral for projects
2326590 hes got to put in one year of solid work and no issues and so forth and hell be welcomed back in next season if he makes it through the year
2326591 there might be some saying why not do surgery now
2326592 well it is his choice and the doctors choice i am sure that they know best
2326593 not to oppose error is to approve it and not to defend truth is to suppress it and indeed to neglect to confound evil men when we can do it is no less a sin than to encourage them
2326594 they nbc news are going to be on the air at least 3 1 2 hours a day between the today show and nightly news on the network they have countless hours of news coverage on msnbc
2326595 this has been the most amazing thing of my life
2326596 its opened me up to all the different styles and what kind of dancer i want to be i cant thank everyone enough
2326597 all along the way from san jose to l a and on the way back again
2326598 im not a huge dance fan i dont go to the ballet or anything
2326599 theres nothing weve asked you to do that you couldnt do
2326600 all we told him was tell the truth and co operate
2326601 for us the most important thing is that our client is properly represented and we understand that with time everything will be solved
2326602 he still came into the gym and practised his shot
2326603 its killing us because he gets a lot of open shots
2326604 if he makes just one or two more shots every night were probably winning some close games instead of losing them
2326605 im not going to say there was no way in the world they could have done that
2326606 but i dont think so i didnt see anything like that
2326607 it was one of the last names i would have expected to see
2326608 seriously one person cannot change the outcome of a game
2326609 if found guilty it would affect his eligibility to play in puerto rico
2326610 we are as surprised as the rest of puerto rico is
2326611 we understand that everyone is presumed innocent and we will wait until the evidence is presented
2326612 its not about people saying i know whats best for you
2326613 if the state certifies me as a promotora i have to speak english
2326614 i have to conform to a system that may or may not reflect that volunteer as well as that professional piece
2326615 if you look hard enough we have promotoras in churches we have promotoras in communities we have promotoras in so many different places
2326616 too many times volunteers are looked upon as free labor
2326617 i really believe its the most important thing i did in my teaching career
2326618 our turnover among teachers and administrators is so frequent in this state
2326619 its where people learn to live together in freedom and respect
2326620 a video game about mania melancholia and the creative process
2326621 heard a lot of people having problems in understanding gravitation
2326622 they are into their personal style more than ever before and trying to get the deals at the store before everyone else does
2326623 i love fashion and look in both high end and discount stores for my clothes
2326624 when people ask me what my personal style is i think of two words nautical and preppy nautical is west coast and preppy is east coast and my style is what happens when they meet ive noticed looking through my favorite fashion magazines that there are no longer back to school articles on the look theyre more on your look my favorite thing about fashion is that it is the best way to express yourself so whether your style is preppy boho sporty or skater the only fall look this year is to express your individual style as creatively as you can
2326625 stand out a lot and can go together with anything
2326626 every teenage girl knows that the peer pressure can really make you want to dress like the popular teens the thing is they dress like everybody else shopping at huge clothing stores i like to take a turn in fashion so i dont look like every other teen in the school so that means avoiding the usual mall stores most of my shopping is done at recycled clothing stores i like to keep my style colorful and girly but i like to show my sporty side occasionally you need to be comfortable so i dress to impress but also make sure im comfy i love to design clothes and i try to sew my designs but my sewing skills arent too hot yet
2326627 i picked this outfit probably because it represents me more than anything else its my style i love the skinny jeans
2326628 the jacket is a nice fit thats the kind of clothes i like preppy style but a little dressed down and not so proper the shoes are comfy and they look cool with jeans
2326629 the point of being a platform is not just the platform itself its a healthy ecosystem playing in the companys direction right now salesforce com is the place to look for an ecosystem
2326630 salesforce hasnt said how much revenue the partners have made on the platform
2326631 i am sure that at some point the company will want to publicize a number that really is a significant part of the platform when its generating a significant amount of revenue for partners the obvious measure is how it compares to salesforce coms own revenue ultimately as a platform provider i would want partner revenue to exceed my own revenue that would mean i am succeeding as a platform vendor
2326632 we had built a global enterprise but did not have the tools necessary to utilize all of our valuable business account information and make it available to staff dispersed across 40 countries
2326633 we explored a number of vendors in the market but salesforce com and the force com platform stood out for its product breadth and rich functionality
2326634 weve always looked at crm as a tool set and our clients are always asking us to model their business within crm so weve always looked at crm as an application framework
2326635 crm 4 0 provides a framework that is very module and a good basis to start building applications on were definitely thinking of it that way i dont know if microsoft is but it wouldnt surprise me we are absolutely on the band wagon using this as a platform
2326636 were excited to be working with our customers on the convergence of social networking and web content management
2326637 our enterprise integration capabilities have separated us from the competition for some time extending these integrations into mashup style applications offers great opportunities for our smaller and medium sized business customers to offer powerful communication methods very inexpensively
2326638 all of these new applications and integrations are the perfect complement to software delivered as a service
2326639 our goal has always been to help our customers manage their content easily and successfully by supporting these standards and integrations into these increasingly popular social networking tools our customers are better enabled to transform their online content strategy and in turn achieve business success
2326640 tomorrow i must close the financial report of the month and submit the final numbers to the boss i have to be back home on time to take chhotu for his vaccination as well hope the quarterly update meeting gets over on time and am able to send the summary to the headquarters before that
2326641 he mixed his pitches he worked quick he looked confident all the things youd want to see from a young guy
2326642 as soon as i walked out there it was a beautiful stadium it took a moment to sink in that i was actually here
2326643 after that when it was a hitters count he wasnt just throwing fastballs
2326644 he was throwing his change up he wasnt letting you just sit on one pitch
2326645 flash media interactive server 3 lets you add value to your video by helping you monetize and socialize your videos
2326646 flash media interactive server applications can be built for the browser the desktop and the mobile device which all enhance the socializing of video
2326647 flash applications offer versatility in creating live real time social communication tools
2326648 for instance our internet tv application allows for programming of a custom online television station with built in chat and live broadcasting capabilities while our livepresenter application creates a multi cam presentation meeting environment
2326649 if they can sit in the stadium and get hammered why cant they sit out here and relax and watch the ball game

2326652 were confident that if it proves to be true the culture of our programs are solid these are isolated events based on individual decisions
2326653 we will take whatever investigative steps are necessary to bring this to a conclusion

2326665 you receive both comprehensive and objective guidance without the salesmanship when i personally shop for real estate cars or other big ticket items i want objective assistance that serves my best interest all too often though i find myself surrounded by sales representatives who focus solely on their own self interest the pressure to buy can be daunting and frustrating buysmart nh offers the high end buyer a refreshing and highly personalized alternative to the usual salesmanship type our mission is to serve as the buyers advocate even if that means advising the client to walk away from a potential purchase
2326666 without a doubt the future of buysmart nh is totally dependent upon the buyers satisfaction
2326667 dear editor i read the excellent birmingham post property supplement with a sense of growing excitement when examining some of the detail surrounding the proposed 10 year 17 billion development of birmingham city centre the iconic v building the development of park central the calthorpe estates proposed 40 million office development and the redevelopment of five ways and the a38 corridor these proposed and planned developments will certainly place birmingham at the forefront of international focus and generate interest from the business and commercial sectors
2326668 unfortunately my enthusiasm slowly waned as i realised that yet again the one key area of focus that is always missing from these grandiose plans is the development of appropriate and suitable transport infrastructure to support the increasing urbanisation of our city

2326704 he asked to sleep on it for a night he doesnt want to be supervised
2326705 no one is accusing him of intentionally maliciously harming the animals
2326706 the animals are the victims here and they dont have a voice
2326707 were passionate about this case we believe the animals were subjected to needless suffering
2326708 for all we know the citizen complaint was rank hearsay and not based on personal knowledge
2326709 because that was the source of our complaint we didnt have probable cause either

2326719 we saw how hard it was for laborde brague inc to get off the ground in the casino computer programmer volunteers industry so weve taken considerable time to plan our own business venture
2326720 but i must say it is easy creating a new corporate community and economic boom that will benefit those around us greatly many times start up companies tend to become burdens to the general public beacuse they fold or otherwise go under but companies like mine mitigate that risk and show profits right away this means less foreclosures and higher credit limits for businesspeople like me who are looking to the future of the casino computer programmer volunteers industry
2326721 youll need lots of capital talent luck and financial discipline to see your project through

2326724 and now i can because of new government grants for internet start ups
2326725 we got start up capital from family friends and a few bank loans
2326726 and then slowly paid each respective party off one at a time this took about five years to do but all debts were satisfied with full repayment and some extra for interest
2326727 i thought id be answering phone calls from creditors and writing order forms out by hand now that we see the potential of the casino computer programmer volunteers consumer market weve immediately hired new staff to meet the high demands of this market
2326728 i hope that this means many more u visas for victims like jose

2326735 that most of you are already familiar with if you have been reading this blog for a few months now
2326736 where this time around my fellow ibm german colleagues lead by my good friend
2326737 merrill sold the investments at a steep loss the united states super senior asset backed security c d o s that merrill sold were once valued at 30 6 billion as of the end of second quarter merrill valued them at 11 1 billion or 36 cents on the dollar and merrill sold them for 6 7 billion to an affiliate of lone star funds the dallas private equity firm merrill provided 75 percent financing to lone star funds which means merrill lent the private equity fund about 5 billion to complete the sale
2326738 just wait until wall street turns on their spigot of cdos cmos etc they will not test the waters they will dump loans en masse
2326739 we thrive in markets that are overdeveloped and overdeveloped markets always have people that are struggling or underperforming we dont really care because were not the chamber of commerce but the more people there are in the market the better it is for us because we take the top end of that business i would prefer that our neighbors be successful but their success is not entirely relevant to our own performance
2326740 i dont want to be too sophisticated here but 2007 is going to suck all 12 months of the calendar year
2326741 way below our book value and in one case half our book value
2326742 like all developers we are struggling withholding tracts of land tied only to a vision bankers do not get that or regard that
2326743 it would appear the council is either going to set itself up as a developer or has become a banking service for mr henderson
2326744 it is absolutely amazing that this council can find 17m to prop up a property developer but cannot find money to prop up rents for our most vulnerable tenants
2326745 it is an appalling decision the reality is it is a bailout for an individual and i do not believe in the council doing that
2326746 i do not regard it as a bailout i regard it as a move the city needed to take
2326747 it is a really bold move we have taken and it shows we are very committed to inner city revitalisation
2326748 it is not a great deal for dave henderson it is a great deal for the council
2326749 my supporters matter hold out because when obama loses i can say i told you i was the better choice
2326750 vote for barack or else we get mccain dont be fucking stupid
2326751 barack is not a muslim as far as i know
2326752 two of us in this race are qualified to be president and all obama has is a speech
2326753 when you submit a set of plans and they disapprove it they give you certain comments or ask you further questions it means they are working on it
2326754 yo soy el root si me ves sonriente mejor que hagas una copia de seguridad
2326755 this is not a close call this is so far beyond what is reasonable
2326756 it is going to throw the legitimacy of the election into question because it is so one sided
2326757 the attorney general has a duty to state the effect and to do so in plain terms of understanding
2326758 teachers will be required to teach young children that there is no difference between gay marriage and traditional marriage
2326759 all my family across china set up an email account and put their names into the ballot and my auntie in xi an in central china got a ticket for the opening ceremony and gave it to me
2326760 because i really want to support both teams so i dont know what its going to be like when they are both in one race
2326761 hes been known for being so fair and having the highest integrity without ulterior motives
2326762 he loves provo and wants whats best for the city and taxpayers
2326763 hes not one to sit in a lawn chair with a soft drink
2326764 in the end i thought of the lift it was going to give me
2326765 we had a little ceremony presenting the cloak to him again as we left the indoor stadium and the team did a haka to acknowledge and honour him
2326766 looking at his face and seeing the joy on it was wonderful
2326767 i just dont think its going up as much as the davis county assessor is claiming
2326768 obviously when youre doing a lot of properties en masse youre going to have a few errors and a few mistakes
2326769 a better appraisal is one that doesnt have any adjustments
2326770 a lot of the times the program is right on and we dont make any change
2326771 we dont have a depth chart its just guys in places
2326772 we havent had a full scrimmage yet this is nothing this is shorts and shoulder pads mostly once we go live and get into game situations thats when we find the guys who are going to play
2326773 yeah it is a competition for the spot but we watch film together and we try to learn the intricacies of the game together instead of fighting for the spot all the time
2326774 absolutely trustworthy it doesnt matter the situation you put him in hes going to do exactly what hes supposed to do to the best of his ability and know why he is doing it
2326775 the internet was designed for us publishers and authors we couldnt have made something any better and i think precious few publishers have taken aggressive advantage of all the ways in which a good internet strategy can spread the world about their products bring them closer to their customers and help them drive sales every publisher i would add author should be thinking of their digital strategy as really beginning with the internet and branching out from there

2326777 i have now been to spain for the first time but it was at the top of a 22km climb not a typo so the moment of border crossing was spent zipping up the jersey grabbing a bottle and hitting 93kph on the decent
2326778 people should not be afraid of their government the government should be afraid of its people

2326786 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2326787 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2326788 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2326789 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2326790 we get support of our president that means a lot that means a lot of people back home want us to succeed
2326791 so we have to go out there and play like were representing the us of a
2326792 are the two members who couldnt even serve in the guard
2326793 hes probably got the most corporate memory right now of anybody on the budget
2326794 i came to sacramento to get things done and thats what my focus is and at the same time i really love people and have worked hard to build relationships
2326795 obviously from a philosophical perspective theres a bit of a distance between us but he has the ability to disagree without being disagreeable and is eminently fair in his approach to policy discussions
2326796 ive never seen john playing politics for the sake of politics
2326797 hes an honest person whos going to give you the straightforward perspective
2326798 john is easily one of the best politicians in the history of santa cruz
2326799 he not only takes on multibillion dollar structural deficits in california but also is willing to engage in issues like whether off leash dogs can continue to use the beach here in santa cruz

2326801 any time spent on standardized testing is time taken away from instruction
2326802 if we end up with a plan that takes more time with testing than were already doing were going in the wrong direction
2326803 sometimes students put a ceiling on themselves thinking they dont have as much intelligence as they do

2326828 once the three men were in the water there was very little chance they could get back on the boat as it was blown before a 15 knot wind and they struggled in lumpy seas
2326829 from that point the end would have been swift none of them was a good swimmer the seas were choppy the men would quickly have become exhausted and sunk beneath the waves
2326830 our special thanks go to the water police and the police for their effective operation and their care and compassion towards our families during this very difficult time especially since we were so far away from where it happened
2326831 i have not the slightest doubt that each of the men would contact their wives and families were they alive
2326832 we have seen a typical family paying 35 per cent more for their fruit and vegetables than they did five years ago
2326833 when families fill up their baskets and trolleys at the local supermarket they should not have to worry if they are getting a raw deal by inflated grocery prices
2326834 a step in the right direction to try and turn the pressure around
2326835 food prices in australia have risen significantly but only a small part of this can be blamed on any lack of competition
2326836 metcash is extracting some monopoly profits because of the lack of alternative wholesaling arrangements available to most independent retailers
2326837 all i want to say is that the sin i forgot to warn against is absolutism anyone who believes they know exactly what im thinking isnt speaking for me only my love is absolute everything else evolves which is the whole reason i created you all in the first place
2326838 we are three australian prisoners of war we escaped from camp early in july as nippon was starving all men they were dying six and seven a day this dusan headman found us and has looked after us ever since building a little hut in the jungle we are still very weak but ok baragah is a tuan besair big chief and you will find all the dusans very sincere today they wanted me to write this note and baragh is going to contact you hope it will not be long before i see you to my knowledge only about ten or 20 pows left out of 3000 or more do all you can for baragah we are anxiously waiting to hear from you about five miles from ranau
2326839 stop where you are because the japanese in the area
2326840 botterill and short at the head of the line of villagers were slumped over beside the track sure they could go no further when they heard the heavy tramp of footsteps
2326841 they were expecting the worst when an undeniably australian voice boomed how ya going boys
2326842 the condition of the three men had a profound effect on hodges a man often described as a gentle giant at first he had been shocked and immensely sad that his countrymen could be so reduced to this state by other human beings but his sadness soon gave way to anger an anger which later stirred him to physical violence when two captured japanese soldiers brought to the camp tried to make a break the first he simply threw to the ground the other he knocked unconscious
2326843 i was a member at the time of the z special unit and we were sent to morotai for an operation to ranau
2326844 nelson was so bloated but i thought keith was the worst i picked him up like a little baby he was so emaciated i was only a comparative youngster but i felt that this should happen to a fellow australian soldier was too much then my reaction was just one of anger i must confess i wore that anger for years afterwards
2326845 mick is a very tall man a very courtly gentle man
2326846 no land deal and there was no question of withdrawing it

2326852 victims whom i have met with continue to complain of headaches skin lesions nose throat and lung problems as well as digestive problems
2326853 i am very concerned about the situation especially for women who have complained of an increase in premature births early menopause and miscarriages since the dumping occurred
2326854 the people of abidjan need urgent assistance after two years they continue to live in precarious conditions and their right to a healthy and safe
2326855 some of the victims i met are the most vulnerable without enough money to eat let alone pay for expensive medical bills
2326856 i hope to be able to get a more comprehensive view of what happened and ascertain responsibility
2326857 this is to send a signal to other transnational corporations and individuals that such crimes will not go unpunished and that africa is not a cheap dumping ground
2326858 we will not chase certain types of violations this is one of those situations
2326859 this kind of policy does not give the residents a lot of confidence that police will protect us
2326860 it kind of says were wide open the police cant chase you
2326861 we need to balance the safety of the community against a stolen tv
2326862 if its a safety issue that a car pursuit is dangerous to other traffic and residents then i can understand that
2326863 on the other hand weve had so many burglaries over here when you catch someone id think theyd have some foresight

2326867 if you look hard enough we have promotoras in churches we have promotoras in communities we have promotoras in so many different places
2326868 too many times volunteers are looked upon as free labor
2326869 im no scientific expert but walking through an airport doesnt seem like the place where it would be necessary to wear them
2326870 the dollar has depreciated so much that america is on the sale rack

2326873 nuclear weapons could be used to stop earth bound asteroids but in most instances they are not the best option said apollo astronaut rusty schweickart during a public lecture this wednesday in san francisco the venerable scientist explained that all but the largest heavenly bodies can be redirected by rear ending or towing them with an unmanned spacecraft but last year nasa issued a report stating that using nukes is the best strategy to prevent a catastrophic collision with earth
2326874 that doesnt surprise me that millions of years or hundreds of millions of years of evolution would be a good starting point for what we need for this day and age
2326875 the armors been sort of fine tuned during that time for different aspects
2326876 in lab experiments aimed to confirm work done more than three decades ago researchers found that when treated with hydrogen natural diamonds formed crystalline layers of water on the surface water is essential for life as we know it also the tests found electrical conductivity that could have been key to forcing chemical reactions needed to generate the first life
2326877 what worries me is the complete lack of accountability by fannies and freddies executives as well as wall street investment bankers also now being insured by taxpayers weve created the worst form of socialized capitalism private gains combined with public losses these executives and bankers are among the best paid in all of corporate america their organizations are treated as if theyre giant investor driven private sector entities as long as theyre healthy but when they start to go down the tubes they become public entities with public responsibilities and the rest of us have to bail them out

2326884 try to remember that i actually can play golf even though it didnt look like that on the first hole
2326885 my caddie said remember we played with tiger in the u s open and i think he took 6 down the first hole pretty much every day so you can shoot a good round from here as well
2326886 i feel like our camp is the best value around
2326887 its everything about it from signing autographs all day to every day taking batting practice with fans screaming your name to tossing balls from the field
2326888 we had a police escort every day to the field the fans there are just unbelievable and thats the greatest part about it
2326889 there is a place i want to go to but i dont know where there is someone i want to meet but i dont know who

2326906 there are elements within the u s administration who would be very nervous about musharraf leaving the scene as they think the civilians are not in control of the army and isi pakistans inter services intelligence agency

2326919 there is a place i want to go to but i dont know where there is someone i want to meet but i dont know who
2326920 its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
2326921 it is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves
2326922 we all can perform best times and not even make the finals
2326923 i feel like we can be coming home with two medals
2326924 we have a real good shot at that but who knows what is going to happen
2326925 you dont own the medal until you stand on the podium and they put it around you neck im not going to say its ours or anything but i feel we have a really great opportunity in the relay
2326926 we could have an absolutely fantastic meet and still come up short in terms of what we are looking for
2326927 we think we have a few medal chances what we really want to do is compete well and make canadians proud and the athletes proud of what they have done
2326928 other national teams in the past a lot of people were just happy enough with showing up getting the track suits having good times and getting the tattoos
2326929 now we have really instilled on the younger people that you have to come in race hard swim fast and perform well
2326930 its that mentally that has got this team more upbeat
2326931 it really came down to a more inclusive approach and empowering the athletes
2326932 we realize we are all in this together it cant be we they it has to be us
2326933 weve created an environment where we could involve the athletes in some of the decision making process in respect to team discipline and a team code of conduct it made them feel like its not just our team but its their team
2326934 i think my mistake in athens was thinking too much about my competition i am going into this with no personal expectations other than i just want to finish fast
2326935 we like to win just as much as everybody else
2326936 the composition and dynamics of north atlantic communities will change
2326937 but whether that will help or harm local fisheries is an open question humans may have to adapt as well
2326938 the interesting thing to me is that the fossil record has something to say about the consequences of global warming
2326939 we cannot have this scale of investment without the congestion charge

2326949 we are now seeing floods and landslides closing road and railways
2326950 this is just the kind of impact we will expect to see more of as the climate changes further
2326951 scotland has the potential to produce the best climate change legislation anywhere in the world setting the benchmark for the climate talks over the next 18 months
2326952 the snp have promised a lot but the detailed legislation will need to include all of the climate change gases and emissions from international aviation and shipping if it is to capture all of scotlands direct impact
2326953 i just wanted to do as well as i could at the plate
2326954 i wasnt thinking about needing a win or anything i was just thinking about that moment
2326955 hes our top hitter and he is playing great defence at shortstop
2326956 they like playing here and it may have helped get us untracked after losing the first two now maybe we can go back to sydney mines and play our game
2326957 once your pitcher has thrown 45 pitches he needs two days and a game rest
2326958 you really have to be aware of their numbers in todays game we had to take our starter adam mackenzie out after 45 pitches so we could have him for saturday you end up putting young players in and sometimes they get rattled it can be nerve racking
2326959 it was pretty windy out there but were from amherst so we play in the wind all the time
2326960 the conditions were much different this afternoon than they were in the morning during wednesdays first round it was so calm yesterday but the wind was blowing enough today to affect the golf ball the scores were a little high today so im ecstatic with my result
2326961 you cant hit driver here you have to keep it in the fairway i think i only hit driver on five holes everything else i was hitting 3 iron off the tee but i putted really well and hit a lot of greens
2326962 it would be awesome to go back to back you couldnt ask for anything better it would be like the boys from river hills who won the mid back to back
2326963 gary and i play a lot of golf together so we kind of feed off each other were pretty good buddies
2326964 i feel that were the guys that every time we go there that everybody has to pay attention to us in order to win
2326965 now there are times we dont win obviously but were still in the hunt every time and got a shot
2326966 its not like were not running well because we are
2326967 weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way youll have that
2326968 in nine years weve won four races if you cant be counted as a factor after that i dont know when they do count you as a factor
2326969 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2326970 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2326971 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2326972 the last 24 hours have been crazy this off season has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2326973 im not going to blame one side or the other a lot of things happened this season a lot of shocking things but at this point its irrelevant
2326974 there is a place i want to go to but i dont know where there is someone i want to meet but i dont know who
2326975 its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
2326976 it is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves
2326977 unfortunately the political powers both on the south and the north did not agree
2326978 and i regret this very much because this is a setback for peace and harmony and reunification
2326979 the ioc has to respect the sovereign decision of governments and this is definitely something that both people wanted but they in their country are also under their government
2326980 i dont know if it was a release of emotion or it just was everybodys chance to get some free shots in on me i think guys were taking advantage of giving me some rib shots and some jabs
2326981 im always celebrating everybodys elses at home plate and to get to be the one that jumps into the pile is pretty fun
2326982 he was asking about some of the mental mistakes that ive made and i told him it was a one time deal and it wouldnt happen again
2326983 everybody when they come here to new york wants to prove in a statistical manner that they belong
2326984 it will turn around for him and if it doesnt but we win the game what can you do its not like hes scuffling for a job or something
2326985 i hope and pray this year we dont have another incident of that nature and there is no reason to believe that we will
2326986 otherwise we are morally bankrupt and effectively we are telling our kids if you want to succeed fill yourself up with a mouthful of pills
2326987 the public will desert any sport in time that they are not satisfied has integrity in the way in which it operates
2326988 the doping cases in recent weeks and months in the lead up to the beijing games are just one indication that the worldwide fight against doping in sport has made a giant leap forward
2326989 many of these recent cases are as a result of nations stepping up their testing efforts to ensure the athletes they send are clean
2326990 we are reviewing our roster of creative agencies across the portfolio as part of our standard business practices
2326991 were just extremely ecstatic that chief washington is going back to his job as he should be
2326992 we thought the whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning and the truth finally came out
2326993 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2326994 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2326995 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2326996 an infection in the liquid tissue and sheath surrounding and containing a muscle
2326997 just about anything makes more sense than an event as a fundraiser
2326998 i would define a gala or other fundraising event as an event that has nothing to do with your mission or so little to do with your mission that a funder would laugh if you tried to fund it as a real mission related activity
2326999 thats my goal this team has given me a lot of opportunities no ones frustrated more than i am with whats gone on
2327000 id like to contribute thats definitely my goal but i cant get that far ahead of myself
2327001 this is a delicate rehab it calls for one step at a time 15 more pitches at a time ive gotten better every time
2327002 i dont need any extra motivation my motivation is to win
2327003 im very proud of my area around the plate i dont want anyone messing with my dirt
2327004 its a yankee world were just falling apart in it
2327005 i think it is too little too late for the yankees to make the playoffs
2327006 thinking out of the inbox more collaboration through less e mail
2327007 i have already finished the slide deck and this time around it is very much public for open consumption outside of the firewall so once i get the heads up from the conference organisers i will be sharing the deck over here after i upload it into
2327008 this is a situation in which there is no waiver for immunity he jackson was the real cause of the whole problem even if the school district had not done anything and hed used common sense and not picked up the bat we wouldnt be here
2327009 we dont have any duty to protect him jackson against a danger thats obvious
2327010 they just throw out every defense in the book just hoping some of it will stick
2327011 i dont fault them for that but they say the governments not responsible i disagree with that
2327012 we hope this information is used as a springboard for collecting future trends information

2327021 the industry needs to wait and watch this is an extraordinary situation where everything is uncertain
2327022 with reference to the order passed by the chinese government a large number of industries situated around the venue of the olympic games were forced to shut down or relocate to other sites most units were involved in the production of chemicals as a result there was a favourable shift towards indian chemical industries in the global market more india business stories get the latest sensex update however once the olympics end the major question will be regarding actions taken by the chinese government and the reaction of indian chemical units as of now there is a high level of uncertainty prevailing in the indian chemical industry

2327033 now it appears rather easy for my girls to make 10 000 rakhis in a month in 1998 when we filed the tender of rakhis in air india we got an unexpectedly high order of 10 000 rakhis initially we found the target too difficult to achieve but we did it finally that experience inspires us a lot since then we have been making rakhis in big numbers every year
2327034 i joined the centre at a time when i had lost all hopes of a marriage and badly needed a place where i could do something on my own i was paid rs600 a month but more importantly i felt i was doing something creative when i was making rakhi it was something constructive which was also a good time pass i really enjoyed it
2327035 i came to know about the centre by reading an article in a newspaper and thought i must help these women we distributed the rakhis among our company staffers and all of us have a feeling that we are wearing something special

2327039 it is inevitable for a class of people to travel by air however with such successive hikes in airfares this year we believe that their frequency of travelling by air will reduce one might also choose to travel by train one way
2327040 there will not be much effect on international air travelling but domestic market has already been hit badly ever since the second round of hike itself when markets dipped by 15 per cent
2327041 while advertising for travel packages tour operators have been very cautious they clearly mention air fares quoted as on today in the ads so that repeated hikes in airfares do not affect the business greatly
2327042 i used to fly at least four times a month to mumbai for business purpose however with the hike in airfares i have started travelling by train as well this round of airfare hike will put off the leisure travellers for sure
2327043 the group of holiday goers who chose to travel by air only due to low fares was increasing but this was bound to fizzle out with airfare hikes and inflation however business travel will not be affected much

2327060 were trying to spend as little as possible and looking for good deals on everything
2327061 i see a lot of stuff that would be nice to have but i dont really need
2327062 its different times now and everyone is buying only what is needed
2327063 the result is that its going to take kids out of their favorite stores and move them into the stores their parents want them to shop in
2327064 youre going to see students buying in stores that arent their first choice
2327065 and with freshmen especially youll get parents saying ill let you pick out the computer you want but not the clothes
2327066 spend 100 and get the next 30 in purchases for free
2327067 the design of what we offer is whats attracting the college customer and the affordability of the products is very appealing too
2327068 they want to feel like theyre making their own choices based on their personal sense of style
2327069 we understand that its an important part of our business but we think that one of the things that appeals to a young customer is when you dont market to them
2327070 with the summer season upon us we have noticed a large increase of cyclists using the a74 to travel between gretna and carlisle and vice versa
2327071 there is signage for cyclists at both junction 44 of the m6 and at guardsmill interchange on the a74 telling them to use the a7 through longtown
2327072 some cyclists are ignoring this and with the roadworks and contra flow in place there is a really high risk of an accident involving cyclists

2327075 ahmed was born in egypt but came here when he was only six months old and grew up in southern california hes chosen one of the absolutely hardest careers you could possibly choose to be a comedian and actor i couldnt resist

2327080 theres a huge crack of thunder like you better think twice about that
2327081 i never would have thought that having a terrible thunderstorm during the wedding would be a good thing
2327082 dan was laughing about it after he got back from the e r thanks to the pain medication but it took me a few days to see the humor in it
2327083 you have the image in your head but nothings exactly as you imagine it to be
2327084 its my job to make sure they dont know what goes wrong
2327085 you have to change the way you look at things
2327086 you cant look at problems as disasters but as humorous incidents
2327087 if people go into the day with that perspective they can have a good time
2327088 if people spent as much time on their marriages as they do planning their wedding the divorce rate would be much lower
2327089 i thought things are going to happen no matter how well you plan
2327090 as long as we end up married at the end of this day thats what counts
2327091 looking back on this i would not change a thing about it
2327092 i didnt know everybody was supposed to know especially when it wasnt a done deal and it wouldnt go down
2327093 its kind of between myself and my agent and boston and the padres
2327094 i dont think really anything needs to be said other than i made a commitment to play for this team for three or four years and at the end thats where i still stand
2327095 i signed a three possibly four year deal here im committed to fulfill that contract if next year doesnt work out with the option ill be a free agent and i can choose where i go

2327097 its inevitable that people from different countries may not see eye to eye
2327098 so we should try to expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
2327099 they want those leaders to confirm the fact that china has returned to great power prominence in the world

2327110 we have foiled a coup attempt that should have been carried out early on thursday by a group of officers led by rear admiral jose americo bubo na tchuto head of the navy

2327117 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity
2327118 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2327119 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2327120 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2327121 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2327122 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2327123 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2327124 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2327125 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2327126 they spent the last few years trying to integrate it
2327127 there are a lot of questions that a buyer and the government would have to have
2327128 its not exactly a healthy asset its a sub scale narrow band network that has limited capacity and has a subscriber base thats leaving in droves
2327129 improving operations making additional investments entering into strategic partnerships and considering potential divestitures
2327130 every piece of the business is for sale at a certain price right now because they continue to struggle
2327131 even if they want to sell iden i dont think theres a buyer
2327132 the images of china we have are that it is an agrarian society that is drab insular and grey its so not that
2327133 it will be tough but they will accommodate and conform
2327134 some they met some they rose up to but i think they fell short on a lot of international expectations
2327135 i feel like the generation before was greatly biased against china that they cant get past it and see all the great things here i hope the olympics show the rest of the world that china is trying

2327141 you never know what will be huge and what will never be heard
2327142 i see 4 year olds jumping out of their car seats now
2327143 i picked this outfit probably because it represents me more than anything else its my style i love the skinny jeans
2327144 the jacket is a nice fit thats the kind of clothes i like preppy style but a little dressed down and not so proper the shoes are comfy and they look cool with jeans
2327145 it is the flagrant lack of practicality that makes high heel shoes so fascinating
2327146 in every country of the world including germany internet pages are blocked here its right wing websites which are locked down and of course in china there are pages as well which will be censored
2327147 but free access should be provided to all important information needed by journalists to do their work
2327148 there are many cases where certain information is not available due to local law or local custom
2327149 do you ever wonder how you think if you do this book will fascinate and inform you if you dont you will after reading this book either way youll enjoy learning how we dont usually do it as we think we do how we may do it better for that very reason and how we may do it still better once we understand
2327150 means to an end rather than an end in themselves
2327151 the only really effective apologia for christianity comes down to two arguments namely the saints the church has produced and the art which has grown in her womb
2327152 if the church is to continue to transform and humanize the world how can she dispense with beauty in her liturgies that beauty which is so closely linked with love and with the radiance of the resurrection no christians must not be too easily satisfied they must make their church into a place where beauty and hence truth is at home without this the world will become the first circle of hell
2327153 team 3 lost the first two games in the series and team 3s owner complained to nba officials
2327154 team 3s owner alleged that referees were letting a team 4 player get away with illegal screens
2327155 nba executive y told referee supervisor z that the referees for that game were to enforce the screening rules strictly against that team 4 player referee supervisor z informed the referees about his instructions as an alternate referee for that game tim also received these instructions
2327156 hes rehashing a variety of things that have been given to the us attorney and the fbi fully investigated and are baseless
2327157 mr donaghy is the only one that is guilty of a crime
2327158 im unconcerned i think what is going to happen is we are going to learn what we have been telling you we have been as open and transparent as we can
2327159 mukherjee beautifully weaves the ever morphing web of technology business and organizational learning together and explains why both top executives and middle managers must care about their impact
2327160 the business world is moving toward non hierarchical networks the answer to these changes is a combination of network management and collaborative leadership mukherjee goes beyond description of best practices the four design principles that he has developed to implement networks are conceptually well thought through and actionable this book deserves to be read by anybody who is interested in tomorrows organization
2327161 an adaptive organization must count as the response in the increasingly connected world in which business will operate in the decades ahead
2327162 beyond the obvious this is a great and pragmatic book demonstrating the incredible power of collaboration in action
2327163 though many have sought to unlock the secrets of creating learning organizations few have succeeded in the spiders strategy mukherjee provides the keys to the learning kingdom and he shows what it really takes to leverage the power of networks it is that rare business book that deserves to be read from cover to cover
2327164 mukherjee has written a very thoughtful and thought provoking book the adaptive network perspective with its four design principles and the accompanying five capabilities inspired by a chief network officer will be the organizations of the present and future the book presents good theory research grounded in facts and a clear picture of what is both necessary and possible going forward
2327165 it is precisely woman who most harshly suffers the consequences of the confusion of the superficiality o fa culture that is the fruit of masculine attitudes of mind masculine ideologies which deceive woman uproot her in the depths of her being while claiming that in reality they want to liberate her
2327166 one forgets that in the ancient world all the religions also had priestesses all except one the jewish
2327167 these sites may generate millions or tens of millions of revenue annually
2327168 yet the water licence fee for the largest capacity run of the river project one that generates more than 20 megawatts is capped at 10 000 smaller facilities of less than 20 megawatts pay 5 000
2327169 but the charge is not based on the price of that energy
2327170 for smaller projects the rate is 1 086 per megawatt hour larger projects pay 5 069 per megawatt hour regardless of the price
2327171 you have to look at the cumulative impact of seven or eight projects just in this area
2327172 you have to add up the number of kilometres of streams that are diverted the pipes diverting the water all sorts of access roads and power lines crisscrossing the valley and the substations that will have to be built
2327173 the furry creek plant went from 6 2 megawatts to 10 with no consultation and culliton creek went from 4 5 megawatts to 12 megawatts with no review
2327174 its really quite outrageous given how valuable this water resource is that we get almost nothing for it
2327175 down the road we will pay a huge price because these power companies will eventually be able to sell to the highest bidder in other words into the u s market
2327176 i think many of the local investors will flip the ownership of the most lucrative sites capitalizing on their enormous financial windfall by selling them to energy multinationals
2327177 if one looks at the policy decisions that have been made it seems clear that the government is moving incrementally to privatize the electricity system
2327178 don has held senior positions at bc hydro including senior vice president power supply vp production and vp operations
2327179 at the moment there are hundreds of proposals across b c to access our rivers and streams for run of the river hydro projects with no analysis of the cumulative impacts
2327180 each one is approached as a one off this gold rush mentality ignores important questions relating to overall environmental impact
2327181 we need to remove the shackles placed on bc hydro with respect to renewable energy projects
2327182 bc hydro should be allowed to fully compete in the process which would mean more scrutiny more public input and better management of a public resource
2327183 there are under the radar threats against the slrd such as the province will remove the zoning authority the province will give the ashlu area to the squamish nation the squamish nation saying it will make life difficult for the slrd a threat heard several times at public hearings and again at the january 2006 slrd meeting
2327184 the order of the day now is consultation and accommodation and the revenue sharing agreement with the company is very satisfactory to the squamish nation
2327185 the ministry is prepared to make a recommendation to government that water reserves be placed on 10 of the 12 streams identified as a high priority for analysis by the slrd board but should the re zoning not be approved our recommendation regarding the water reserves will not proceed
2327186 this is really disturbing the bc government promised world class protected areas and what we appear to be getting are light industrial zones instead
2327187 one of the greatest concerns with this new designation is the amount of secrecy that has surrounded it where was the public consultation process im sure if the government had a full and proper public consultation process that this idea would have been stopped dead in its tracks
2327188 there are a lot of unanswered questions will the government be applying these quasi protected area designations to existing parks and future protected areas in bc
2327189 what does the public think about run of river hydro projects industrial roads lodges and motorized recreation within protected areas
2327190 theres going to be less public land available to the public
2327191 youll see a large upswelling of public opposition to this not just among conservation groups but among recreation groups and wildlife groups throughout the kootenay region
2327192 what are we getting ourselves into this is really kicking the door open these are public parks and the public has not been consulted its been done completely behind closed doors
2327193 this is a major initiative around the privatization and commercialization of our provincial parks
2327194 theyre not going to stop at 12 if this proceeds how many are going be on the list next year and the year after
2327195 there will be public consultation required before any proposal goes forward
2327196 through all that expansion of space there have been virtually no new facilities added
2327197 virtually every major park down there has some kind of commercial operation in it which isnt necessarily a bad thing
2327198 the duties of the permittee will include but not be limited to the following operating a year round reservation system for the cabin park user fee collection ongoing and regular maintenance and improvement of the facilities notwithstanding this duty bc parks will remain responsible for the funding of major repair projects greater than 1 000 that have the prior written approval of bc parks upgrading the water toilets and grey water systems providing potable water to the cabin and campground users maintaining and submitting to bc parks financial reports and attendance statistics and may include the provision of appropriate recreational services
2327199 the general expectation is for the successful proponent to establish and manage a successful business enterprise with a fair return to the province for this opportunity
2327200 the business opportunity encompasses the restoration operation maintenance and operation of the lodge as well as the associated financing and the operation maintenance and management of all visitor services and accommodation facilities in the core area of mount assiniboine provincial park
2327201 the ministry is interested in descriptions of likely operating cycles that address matters such as balancing the protection of natural values of the cape scott provincial park with the need for facilities or recreational features or services needed in order to make the business successful in meeting the goals of this project
2327202 each proponent should describe who is going to be their primary secondary and tertiary market potential size and value of each target market promotional means and the use of media
2327203 for those who prefer a tent bc parks does provide more than 11 000 campsites however not everyone who wants to enjoy a parks experience is able to sleep on the ground in a tent thats why the provincial government requested proposals last month to build and operate fixed roof accommodations in a handful of selected parks
2327204 operators will have to pay annual fees to government for these permits all of this revenue will stay within the bc parks system to help fund services and programs
2327205 in fiscal 2006 2007 the total budget for the environmental stewardship division of the ministry of environment is 69 987 million that budget covers fish and wildlife branch parks branch protected areas and ecosystems something we were just talking about a moment ago in terms of species at risk the budget in terms of b c parks itself would be approximately 30 million
2327206 capable of accommodating approximately 30 45 guests in 5 15 rooms and should also include common areas and associated food and beverage services
2327207 it is expected that the proposed lodge at maxhamish lake would cater primarily to fly in guests wanting to fish on one of british columbias most productive lakes for trophy walleye and pike
2327208 the anticipated market to be served by the new park facilities is that of adventure tourists
2327209 the fact that the government is steam rolling this shows complete contempt for public consultation
2327210 what seems to be forgotten is that these are public parks being proffered up for development
2327211 additional private for profit lodges of any sort are unacceptable in our parks but when we saw these proposals we were astounded the bc government is proceeding with the development of our public parks as if they were mcdonalds franchises
2327212 they have created a how to guide for developers promised public consultation has become a sham not about whether resorts be allowed in parks in the first place but about how wide roads will be and the colour of resort awnings

2327218 it seems like the buzz around here is beach volleyball
2327219 its a great office environment with half naked women running around
2327220 for beach volleyball to be in that class is amazing
2327221 i dont think it has anything to do with bikinis or not bikinis
2327222 the sport has a sex appeal that track and field and some others dont but this is not tennis and its not golf you can make noise any time you want
2327223 people used to think you guys are just a bunch of girls in bathing suits running around
2327224 but when people come to an event they see the athleticism then they get caught up in everything the venue will be hopping
2327225 before when you said beach volleyball people said oh the united states and brazil
2327226 sabadee where you fom belgium sauna good sauna very good
2327227 s avonds was mijn cs host ziek en de andere gasten waren vertrokken erg gezellig
2327228 far too often we see that individuals who participate in these atrocities come and seek to hide in the united states lie on their visa applications and try to blend in in the american neighborhoods our work is designed to ensure that we identify these people prosecute them criminally where we can and then remove them from this country to make sure the united states is not a safe haven for these individuals
2327229 the sentence was a stunning rebuke to prosecutors who had insisted on a prison term of atleast 30 years and portrayed hamdan thoroughout the trial as a hardened al queda warrior
2327230 counter allegations that the military tribunals are unfair because the rules give great lattitude to prosecutor
2327231 ours is a friendship based on mutual trust and understanding to impute ulterior motives is mischievous to say the least
2327232 iran is sincerely committed to the development of sri lanka whom we consider to be a true friend
2327233 our commitment has already been proved by a pledge of over us 450 million in assistance for several sri lankan projects including the sapugaskanda oil refinery and uma oya irrigation scheme
2327234 iran wants to expand economic and commercial ties with all saarc members including sri lanka we can help the region develop its energy resources and food production among other things

2327245 vxr takes the experience knowledge and passion gained from racing and crystallises it into a range of high performance road cars
2327246 its hard to believe two years have gone by since we opened for business the time really has flown by not only have we grown in terms of the number of our members but also in the number of manufacturers who want to sell their products through directbuy and thats got us even more excited about year number three

2327257 tyson made this request on behalf of its shelbyville plant employees some of whom had expressed concern about the new contract provisions relative to paid holidays
2327258 in an effort to be responsive tyson asked the union to reopen the contract to address the holiday issue and the union agreed to do so the union membership voted overwhelmingly thursday to reinstate labor day as one of the plants paid holidays while keeping eid al fitr as an additional paid holiday for this year only this means that in 2008 only shelbyville employees will have nine paid holidays
2327259 this issue concerns only the plant at shelbyville tenn labor day has always been celebrated and continues to be at the other 118 tyson plants across the country
2327260 an additional paid holiday eid al fitr a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
2327261 union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
2327262 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
2327263 if this holiday is that important to them make them take it off instead of christmas day and allow all workers to be off labor day most american families have some type of function on labor day
2327264 it says union leadership made this request makes you wonder who runs the union i guess they are already working on a plan to replace memorial day that means nothing to the muslims so why should we have the right to celebrate it labor day commemorates the plight of workers and the struggle of labor unions to improve working conditions for american workers the muslims will not stop until all of our rights and laws are changed to accommodate their beliefs this will be a new america but it will be their america
2327265 diversity is one of the strengths of our union we may come from different countries and speak different languages but what unites us is the belief that by standing together we can better advance our interests
2327266 the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
2327267 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
2327268 this is america founded by the blood of our forefathers and should not be challenged by somalians hispanics or any other immigrants if they come to america they need to learn our language and our ways they can practice their culture in private if they so please but not shove it down our throats would they let us go there and change there country i have banned tysons products from my home for years because of the illegals they were hiring i am sorry for the producers that are supplying them but tysons has once again crossed the line with the american people labor day was here long before tysons what holiday will be next to be taken away and replaced to accommodate an immigrant this stinks worse than the plant
2327269 dedicated to the social and economic achievements of american workers it constitutes a yearly national tribute to the contributions workers have made to the strength prosperity and well being of our country
2327270 mans true nature that of a carnal beast living in a cosmos which is permeated and motivated by the dark force which we call satan
2327271 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2327272 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2327273 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2327274 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2327275 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2327276 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2327277 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2327278 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2327279 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2327280 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2327281 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2327282 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2327283 to sit here and not sign it and postpone this is just poor management this is a project that would take thousands of people off the road
2327284 i dont want to take possession of something that looks like this if we have not done our studies to show theres no contamination in it
2327285 if youre going to put dirt in it who cares about stagnant water right now

2327299 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2327300 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2327301 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2327302 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2327303 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2327304 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2327305 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2327477 this tournament will be an ideal preparatory tool for the uefa championship first qualifying phase which kicks off this autumn when we face france malta and liechtenstein with a place in the elite qualifying phase at stake there are a number of experienced players in this squad coupled with a number of young players who now have the opportunity to battle their way into the side
2327478 to hold this four nations tournament in the midlands area is a great boost for us and the football family in the midlands last year we played a number of under 17 games in athlone and longford and the turn out from the local supporters was brilliant over the past couple of seasons there have been tremendous strides in improving football facilities throughout the country this is increasingly evident at clubs such as athlone town fc tullamore town fc and indeed longford town athlone town fc have a state of the art stadium in lissywoollen which passes all the uefa criteria for underage international games and tullamore town fc who have recently moved to the impressive leah victoria park

2327521 a man is judged by his deeds not by his words
2327522 but as for me i would seek god and i would place my cause before god who does great and unsearchable things wonders without number he gives rain on the earth and sends water on the fields so that he sets on high those who are lowly and those who mourn are lifted to safety he frustrates the plotting of the shrewd so that their hands cannot attain success he captures the wise by their own shrewdness and the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted by day they meet with darkness and grope at noon as in the night but he saves from the sword of their mouth and the poor from the hand of the mighty so the helpless has hope and unrighteousness must shut its mouth behold how happy is the man whom god reproves so do not despise the discipline of the almighty for he inflicts pain and gives relief he wounds and his hands also heal
2327523 this is the word of god listen obey love him
2327524 behold how happy is the man whom god reproves so do not despise the discipline of the almighty for he inflicts pain and gives relief he wounds and his hands also heal
2327525 i know you felt bad today but youve handled it very well
2327526 now andrew swanston has got a church to his mind
2327527 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2327528 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell
2327529 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2327530 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2327531 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2327532 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2327533 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2327534 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system

2327540 i knew her high school m u coach dr bill ginn well he spoke highly of caulette and of course she was in kansas in the first place in order to play for ginns daughter jen who is the volleyball coach there snider dearth took a quick look at her and she offered

2327542 theyre solid students fun to be around and we hear that they work hard when they get to practice we took them both you would have too and you should meet the rest of the kids
2327543 we cant wait for aug 4 for practice to start
2327544 caulette is an outside hitter weve played together a long time now and that should come in handy this year it is such a team sport and its good to know who you are going to be playing with

2327599 gymnastics has a long proud history the sport can be traced back to ancient greece where such skills featured in the ancient olympic games ancient rome persia india and china practised similar disciplines mostly aimed at preparing young men for battle the word itself derives from the greek word gymnos meaning naked dress requirements for athletes in those days were minimal to say the least

2327605 i think people are opening to their eyes to scientific aspects that are hard to ignore

2327607 i believe in evolution because well its ridiculous to think humans were created out of thin air by a magical figure
2327608 theres an angry and unruly crowd gathered at anniston theres a rumor that some people on this bus are going to stage a sit in the terminal has been closed be careful

2327611 walked by the side of the bus slipped a pistol from his pocket and stared at me for some minutes
2327612 but you mustnt carry any weapons you must trust god and have faith
2327613 some of them had clubs there were some deputies too you couldnt tell the deputies from the ku klux
2327614 you niggers will be taken care of once you get in alabama
2327615 we have received word that a bus has been burned to the ground and passengers are being carried to the hospital by the carloads
2327616 a mob is waiting for our bus and will do the same to us unless we get these niggers off the front seats
2327617 niggers get back you aint up north youre in alabama and niggers aint nothing here

2327633 i was looking for a clean odourless sports bottle for my son to take to school each day and i couldnt get one in the uk when i investigated plastics and the alternatives i became determined to do something positive plastic is an overwhelming threat to our environment as a reformed plastic bottle drinker ive never felt better since i switched to stainless steel it saves money time and effort tastes purer and i know it isnt manufactured using harmful chemicals
2327634 the national childbirth trust is currently campaigning to have plastic drinks containers for children clearly labelled with the health risks and globally theres widespread controversy over the use of bisphenol a in these products
2327635 its a simple step to reduce plastic bottle usage and experience the benefits bisphenol a readily leaches into the fluids contained in plastic bottles and many parents will naturally want to ensure their kids are using safe drinking vessels furthermore by using our bottles children will understand the causal relationship between responsibility and the future of the planet if each generation takes more care of the environment than its predecessors our children and grandchildren will be the beneficiaries
2327636 in the us 250 000 of the stainless steel bottles are sold per month wed like to replicate that success in the uk as just one green bottle can keep heaps of plastic debris off our planet

2327643 si fuera necesario dedicar a el resto de mi vida a hacer frente a este desaf o pero hallo esto sumamente desagradable por dos razones en primer lugar todo el problema me parece trivial y detesto tener que concentrar mi atenci n en algo que no parece intr nsecamente interesante en segundo lugar por mucho que lo intent no pude hacer ning n progreso durante todo 1903 y 1904 mi labor estuvo totalmente dedicada a esta cuesti n pero sin ning n vestigio de xito

2327648 there is growing evidence that excess omega 6 referred to as la below and lack of omega 3 can and do contribute to increasing mental illness and societal aggression impulsiveness lack of self restraint and increasing criminal offences including murder
2327649 the increases in the world la consumption over the past century may be considered a very large uncontrolled experiment that may have contributed to increased societal burdens of aggression depression and cardiovascular mortality
2327650 omega 3 and 6 can profoundly affect hormone balance blood flow and immune system function
2327651 we need to get back to feeding our minds as well as our bodies otherwise the future of the nation is grim
2327652 too much omega 6 arguably inflates many negatives in society from behaviour related knife crime to increasing adhd in kids fed a processed diet high in crisps and chips we need more omega 6 based trials and now excess omega 6 from vegetable oils is likely not only making us sick but mad and bad too

2327688 as scary as it is in these times to talk about going on strike theyre going to have to be prepared
2327689 the tragedy of this is that once they go home many of them cannot take care of their own families

2327715 we only work with original artworks or vintage prints so we are scouting all the time ho says if we see something we think has potential we will buy it but it may be put away for the future if im really in love with a print and the cost is high i will subsidise a print
2327716 its not the best commercial decision to make but the big picture is i want to enjoy what im doing and i want the prints to have integrity
2327717 if we are going to run a print it has to be very strong and almost have a personality of its own prints tend to be very difficult to work with because they are difficult to wear its not like wearing a block colour dress a print needs to be spot on and work on your body

2327764 today marks an historic moment in the history of metropolitan racing in brisbane
2327765 the merger will deliver a more profitable sustainable and strategic direction for racing in brisbane
2327766 a major benefit of the merger will be that instead of competing against each other the focus will be more strongly on competition from other forms of entertainment
2327767 over the past few months the two boards have been working closely together especially in the master planning for eagle farm and doomben racecourses
2327768 the merger will now allow us to really get cracking on the planning for improvements to both racecourses
2327769 we still require some formalities and procedural issues to be finalised but hope that the new club can be up and running by 1 july 2009
2327770 i cant guarantee doomben wont be sold and nobody can
2327771 but if im on the new board i will never vote to sell it i can give you my guarantee
2327772 today the members of our proud racing club have stood up to secure the future of city pacific doomben
2327773 the amalgamation of these two great clubs will provide opportunity capital and infrastructure to move racing forward in the 21st century
2327774 subject to approval it is proposed the new brc will begin operations from july 1 2009 but there is still much to do
2327775 there is now a clear mandate to consider the development of unused land and a major upgrade of facilities transforming the area into a racing precinct queensland will be proud of
2327776 this extra money will put city pacific doomben in a position to develop state of the art spectator facilities and give hospitality areas a much needed major facelift
2327777 cost efficiencies of sharing expenses between the two racetracks provide significant savings
2327778 by being in a position to host events and additional functions on non racing days we will not only generate revenue but it will mean more jobs and more opportunities for current employees
2327779 this secures the future prosperity of racing at eagle farm and doomben racecourses and makes great financial and organisational sense
2327780 the fact that these two clubs will now merge means they can pool their financial resources and become one strong entity for metropolitan racing

2327782 ive been too busy at work and didnt realise the noms for the guineas closed last tuesday
2327783 i dont have a racing calendar and i thought they closed yesterday but i ripped a page out of a racing paper and noticed they closed on tuesday
2327784 its going to cost me a bit more but if he runs well again ill be nominating him next week
2327785 ive had wraps on this horse for a long time and hes improved two or three lengths since his win at doomben
2327786 hes up against a couple of smart horses this time but im sure hell race well
2327787 hes got a good gate four again and if he wins he should just about have enough prizemoney to get into the caulfield guineas
2327788 the plan is to give him another run over 1615 metres at doomben in a fortnight and if he runs well in both these races here hell go to melbourne
2327789 ive got my eye on a few three year old races in melbourne before the caulfield guineas so theres plenty of time to qualify him
2327790 after initiating and advocating in favour of a merger for sometime the board of qrl is pleased with the outcome of todays vote
2327791 we have said all along that an amalgamation of both metropolitan clubs must occur to enable the clubs to move forward
2327792 the amalgamation will now pave the way for a better and brighter future of racing in brisbane and secures that future
2327793 she would really have to strike form early to even think about taking her away again
2327794 the problem with her is that shes now a four year old and she would have to run in fillies and mares races in the south and shed get 56 and 57 kilos in them
2327795 shes group one placed but shes still only a class two horse and by staying at home she can get into these class six plates on the minimum
2327796 in the old days if you had a good horse you could win 15 races going through from a maiden intermediate novice transition etcetera before you got to open company
2327797 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2327798 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2327799 it is usually an offence that is worse than the first one
2327800 a personalized public relations firm that brings out the best in small businesses

2327807 if the environment is important then it should be incumbent on those who are going to tamper with it to examine everything that can be done

2327852 i think it is an important step that the gravity of the situation has been recognized and that there are some steps in place to turn the tide in afghanistan
2327853 whether that is successful or not is of course an open question
2327854 in terms of milestones its important to point out that no casualty is more significant than any other
2327855 each service member is equally precious and each loss of life is equally tragic
2327856 the reported presence in afghanistan of the head of al qaida in iraq underscores the extent to which blowback from iraq is being felt in afghanistan
2327857 at this point leadership seems to be looking at the afghan theater as the next big thing
2327858 the size of the operation and the ability of the group to get support within the town was somewhat alarming and it shows that there is clearly some concern with local afghans and thats a concern because civilians are the center of gravity in a counterinsurgency
2327859 the dangerous message is that there was involvement by the civilians

2327872 a cure will likely require early diagnosis and treatment fauci said
2327873 studies need to be done in next few years to determine if very aggressive therapy early on will allow us to get a functional cure
2327874 i believe we will be able to in some patients not very many eradicate hiv microbiologically and we will have a functional cure in others fauci said
2327875 but this will likely require aggressive drug regimens and rely on the timing of initiating therapy

2327880 my brother knew all of the good hunting spots he said
2327881 it was different back then lots of ducks fewer hunters and the hunters who were in the field were more educated about hunting than hunters are today
2327882 to help get the save the wetlands program going i lobbied at the legislature i educated people about the need for wildlife and wildlife habitat and i traveled the countryside to talk to people who lived near the types of things we were trying to save al said

2327905 when i saw the look on my debbies face that night in the hospital
2327906 i decided i was going to go out and get those bastards myself
2327907 cause i figured the law would go easy on them
2327908 and i wasnt scared of them either because ive got me a gun and ive been shootin all my life

2327910 i knew it was them the minute i saw em but i shot a picture of em anyway
2327911 and took it back to debbie and she said sure as hell it was them
2327912 so i went back to that hotel and found their room and knocked on the door
2327913 and the minute the big one opened the door i shot em right square between the legs
2327914 right where it would really hurt em most you know
2327915 as he backed up pleading to me to spare him
2327916 then i went down to the police station and turned myself in

2327919 with five stroke centers in the community there should be no need for any of the neuro cases to come here anymore and that was 80 to 90 percent of the transfers in
2327920 all of the hospital leadership from the major health systems in san antonio are committed to avoiding the transfer of stroke patients outside of san antonio
2327921 at least weve been able to help someone else and that was the goal
2327922 i believe i was also correct in my prediction that the corporate television news media in our country would pay little or no attention to this historic hearing in the house of representatives some of these same media corporations are basically war profiteers its absolutely despicable and quite insane that a media company like fox can have its morning talk bimbos actually make fun of a topic as serious as war political corruption and death and your sweet church going grandmother sits there watching this vile propaganda of death day after day its frakkin clockwork orange and 1984 come to life seriously change the channel its bad for you bugliosi on wmd vs imminent threat bush impeachment
2327923 at this point you probably could not eat safer anywhere in the world
2327924 the antichrist isnt going to be an american so it cant possibly be obama the bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place like romania

2327926 youre not going to feel great playing football its just one of those things you got to deal with and i felt we did some good things today
2327927 we got to work through our kinks i am encouraged where were going and what were doing we have made a lot of mistakes but we have shown signs of improvement
2327928 its one of those things that i got to plow through im not in good shape either so im battling that too i just have to keep pushing
2327929 i guess thats to be expected when scar tissue breaks from healing but hes pushing through it hopefully hell get to be the consistent player we need him to be
2327930 i dont mind if the foot is the reason for the non sharpness but i do mind when its his decision making the key is for him to stay as consistent as he can be in his decision making so we can count on where the ball is going to go and know that it is going to go in the proper place
2327931 i have an idea in the back of my mind what i want to do but i havent told any of the players yet
2327932 has to be able to catch the ball thats the main thing other things we look for is the ability to change direction balance speed vision
2327933 i have always wanted to do returns so i asked coach gansz and he said to get out there before practice
2327934 im trying to do everything i can to help the team and get on the field
2327935 the little time i got back there last year was exciting for me
2327936 im trying to do it all im trying to make it all happen
2327937 i see maturity in him and an understanding of the defense
2327938 he has been there three years and it is time for him to go
2327939 we just have to get through the one game then we get lockett
2327940 i have to know what everyone on the dang defense is doing
2327941 there are always bright spots but no one is consistent right now
2327942 it would be unfair to say someone leaped ahead because they know what to do on every play
2327943 when we have good nose tackles were really really good
2327944 its like someone coming up and slapping you in the face
2327945 when guys were working out i had to sit back and watch
2327946 theyre looking at you like youre getting a break but youre not you want to be out there
2327947 their techniques the way they play the run and their pass rushes
2327948 im trying to steal whatever they have so i can play at their level
2327949 it could be just one thing how vicious they do the rip or how quick their first step was then ill come out the next day and say this is my first step day or my vicious rip day
2327950 he set the example of what a usc nose tackle was really supposed to be all about
2327951 say the center doesnt try to block me i have to get a hand on him to slow him up from getting to the linebacker
2327952 but i dont have to take that block for the next guy i just have to give them a chance to beat the center and i get freed up as well
2327953 i dont think were going to need to because i think averell spicer and christian tupou or one of those other guys are going to be just fine
2327954 ever since ive been here my philosophy is i cant let anybody younger beat me out
2327955 now im the oldest nose tackle so i plan not to let that happen
2327956 were just going to use that for our motivation this year weve got like a chip on our shoulder were the big question on the offense
2327957 i remember last year i had to get a shot during training camp to ease the pain
2327958 me and turner are taking a leadership role with the younger guys
2327959 it might be a stretch in the next two weeks or so
2327960 i dont see him turning away from that but its a long season and weve got to be ready to go last year was proof of that aaron corp and i just have to be ready to go
2327961 i decided with this one to keep the subject stationary and move the camera
2327962 congratulations on so many years shawny wow what an accomplishment
2327963 sweetheart of 22 years and more how are you holding up away from him i am sure you will be making up for it all when you return home into his arms
2327964 you were in the new york times the wall street journal
2327965 for everything there is a reason and for all there is a time his time
2327966 i wasted so many years if only i had listened to him back then
2327967 we think this is the fumigant of the future not just for fruit and vegetable exports but also lumber
2327968 would you like a the chicken sausage or a mixed wrap
2327969 okay great would you like the bold coffee or the morning brew
2327970 yes i couldnt look away it is the most beautiful angelic face ive ever seen
2327971 you have a wonderful smile its beautiful its so attractive
2327972 as cidades como os sonhos s o constru das por desejos e medos ainda que o fio condutor do seu discurso seja secreto que as suas regras sejam absurdas e as suas perspectivas enganosas
2327973 i am also not a fan of the optional static typing
2327974 its absolutely unreal we put it up at about 8 30pm on sunday and within half an hour there were 80 views
2327975 i am so pleased for these guys i thought they were brilliant when i first saw them perform
2327976 this city and its citizens would proudly give them the honour of youth ambassadors
2327977 this trip has not only opened our eyes to the big wide world but has also helped us build priceless networks and strong friendships
2327978 now it is time for us to reset and focus on the direction that we are heading
2327979 we would like to thank everyone who has supported us in our journey to the world champs
2327980 it is very rewarding that the enormous amount of work we have been putting into improving the experience at auckland airport is appreciated by the people who matter the most the travellers
2327981 we also recognise that airports such as auckland compete in a global market and that we need to continually raise our standards
2327982 i have a cousin who is doing a cupcake display for her wedding in october in lieu of the traditional cake
2327983 so i think i have cupcakes on the mind lately
2327984 some of the things in there are truly extraordinary and very very cute
2327985 one person was convinced to switch their money from a bank to bridgecorp
2327986 a couple in their late 70s switched their entire life savings to a finance company
2327987 advising people to invest their life savings in these companies breaks every financial rule
2327988 some are in their 80s and theyve put their nest eggs in finance companies because they went to their rsa and some financial adviser told them to do it
2327989 if theyre willing to dig in for the fight it offers a lot of hope but court is a long slow and expensive process
2327990 actually we havent found as many bodies as we expected we have however heard singing and have spotted a campfire down the hill aways so were checking that out
2327991 now isnt this better than sitting at a table a girl hasnt got but two sides to her at the table
2327992 you have to gain their trust and get them to open up a bit about their experiences
2327993 but theres only so much money to go around and gattis had 103 new positions requested
2327994 ill never turn anyone away even if ive got to stay here till 10 p m
2327995 the first thing i tell veterans is if youre in for the fight so am i
2327996 i started back a long time ago trying to get something on my own but was never able to accomplish it
2327997 to me nelson is an outstanding person he really believes in the veterans and he does everything that he possibly can to help them
2327998 on august 1 2008 a total solar eclipse will occur as the new moon moves directly between the sun and the earth the moons umbral shadow will fall on parts of canada greenland the arctic ocean russia mongolia and china the exploratoriums eclipse expedition team our fifth will webcast the eclipse live from the remote xinjiang uygur autonomous region in northwestern china near the mongolian border
2327999 a fresh review of the science and other information has failed to convince us that 12 month treatments offer any additional benefits over the current nine week treatment
2328000 but new zealand is fortunate that its drug funding decisions have been taken out of the political realm and are assessed on purely scientific grounds
2328001 we have succeeded in calling into question a lot of pharmacs processes and bringing the issue to the public
2328002 being an election year access to pharmaceuticals is going to be a key issue and with national already promising to fund it if they become government i think its likely women are going to take a critical look at whats on offer
2328003 there is a happy baby and at least it isnt crying
2328004 i met with joshua in cleveland in august of 2007 after he fired andre cologna and signed with me shortly thereafter
2328005 at that time joshua indicated a concern about the contract he signed when he was with cologna he also indicated that his plan to address it was to perform on the field all joshua did was have a pro bowl season in 2007 he has never once complained to the team or the media
2328006 this notion that joshua all of a sudden became dissatisfied with his contract after the pro bowl and hired us to fix it is absolutely inaccurate
2328007 joshua has expressed a concern all along about feeling protected as his agent i would not be doing my job if i did not explore ways to better protect and secure him
2328008 it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show
2328009 theres also a 9 000 pound elephant in it as in the elephant in the room
2328010 we dont have to try and build it up because its so obvious its crazy
2328011 i just got out of the hospital and nova scotia legal aid wont represent me because of my compensation money
2328012 i will be speaking my language if it goes that far
2328013 we generally have a great relationship and an incredibly deep and enduring friendship as a woman i have never been treated better than i have been with this man
2328014 i am pleased with our progress with regard to recreation playgrounds herring cove road improvements policing and sewer and water services to herring cove
2328015 hes constantly looking skyward and has been acting strange ever since it happened
2328016 i guess big bird is down my way now but i did not know what the heck it was
2328017 i didnt think it would make it over the barn
2328018 weve got some pretty big crows down here but ive never seen anything like that
2328019 honestly i have not seen wings that big on anything around here they were humongous
2328020 they fly or perch but they dont really run not many birds can run and if they can run do run
2328021 no way does it sound like any native bird to nova scotia
2328022 coyotes will run away we were just sitting in the driveway and it attacks us from the air
2328023 we have to be prepared to deal with it within existing budgets and then if we are in a situation where it went beyond a certain cost then the federal government would also kick in
2328024 but im hopeful that the weathers going to be good for the remainder of the year and hopefully we wont have any serious circumstances where there will be impacts
2328025 we recognize that from time to time there are going to be circumstances which we have to deal with and we would much prefer to deal with them within firm budgets than have to go the extra mile
2328026 weve started the process of going around the province gathering feedback from individuals
2328027 the minister of the environment is very engaged in that as well as the minister of fisheries and natural resources and others we recognize that as a coastal province we have to be prepared for such things as rising sea levels
2328028 not only on our citizens but on businesses in nova scotia it would be very damaging
2328029 over the course of a four year period we would see heating bills going up upwards of 400 per individual homeowner in nova scotia it would significantly impact our small businesses
2328030 after northern canada the next ones who are going to feel it the most are atlantic canadians with storm surges and with the rising sea levels
2328031 in order to get there you have to lay this extension first
2328032 but you have to do this one step at a time
2328033 the steps may seem small but the costs are large
2328034 it is illegal in my opinion and the opinion of my legal counsel
2328035 there is no legislative authority the municipality doesnt have jurisdiction
2328036 the definition section of the act excludes the new charge
2328037 we dont feel the municipality is complying with the act
2328038 why should we in annapolis county be segregated from the rest of the province by being forced to pay this charge
2328039 if it is something the province has legally charged the municipality since 2001 and the property valuation services corporation set up by the province is charging it this year why wouldnt the municipality be able to pass it on

2328041 the incident was disappointing for both council and streetsmart environmental staff given that it has the potential to detract from the good work that the contractor has recently achieved such as recycling an increasing range of plastics
2328042 we look forward to working with streetsmart over the remaining two years of our contract to continuously improve sustainable recycling in the tasman district
2328043 should i stop trying to get the black communities favor
2328044 if i say yes then i have to have an identity that is strong enough to surpass their attacks
2328045 if we are not ashamed to think it we should not be ashamed to say it
2328046 you may not accept me but you will respect me
2328047 open your fucking minds open your minds be accepting of different people and let people be who they are you know how many people came to me calling me gay cause i wear my jeans the fresh way or because i said hey dude how you gonna say fag right in front of a gay dudes face and act like thats ok that shit is disrespectful coming from chicago where if you saw somebody that was gay you were supppoed to stay ten feet away it should be time to break out of the intuitions that i was sayin the steretypes or the fear the backlash that i would get if you dont believe in what i believe in acceptin people for who they are theyre very talented and if they do something special in the world and theyre discriminated ive flown across the world yall and ive come back here to tell you open your minds and live a happier life
2328048 it was kind of like a turning point when i was like yo this is my cousin i love him and ive been discriminating against gays
2328049 speaking your mind and about breaking down barriers but everyone in hip hop discriminates against gay people

2328066 the pain is not really in the brain the cold temperature of the roof of the mouth is transmitted into some nerves in that area called the sphenopalatine ganglion a ganglion is a collection of nerves
2328067 were dealing with something thats not precisely known but it appears as though it then triggers a cycle of blood vessel contraction with subsequent dilation of the blood vessels that causes the stabbing severe pain that occurs usually in the front part of the head or to one side or behind the eye
2328068 when you eat or drink food or liquid touches your palate say pal it before you swallow your palate is also known as the roof of your mouth you can feel your palate with your tongue
2328069 when something very cold touches the center of the palate the cold temperature can set off certain nerves that control how much blood flows to your head the nerves respond by causing the blood vessels in the head to swell up this quick swelling of the blood vessels is what causes your head to pound and hurt some people call this a brain freeze even though nothing is really happening in the brain its all in the blood vessels of the head
2328070 no treatment is usually required and sufferers rarely seek medical attention since the posterior aspect of the palate is most likely to produce the referred pain of ice cream headache avoiding contact of the cold food with this area can effectively eliminate the symptoms most people arrive at such preventive measures without the advice of doctors ice cream abstinence is not indicated

2328078 on friday 11 24 06 joey underwent brain surgery to remove a large fast growing tumor located in the fluid near his brain stem he was diagnosed only a couple days prior at cincinnati children s hospital due to unusually mild symptoms the tumor had quickly grown large enough to block the flow of cerebral spinal fluid causing periodic headaches doctors needed to perform the surgery before they could determine what type of tumor joey had after a 4 hour surgery they were able to perform a 100 gross total resection and identify the mass as ependymoma it is a rare tumor that affects young children and its cause is still unknown in some cases even after a successful surgery this tumor can reoccur to help prevent this joey received 33 conformal radiation treatments at the site where the tumor was removed fortunately to this day no sign of ependymoma has been found at the original site however nearly one year later 3 smaller ependymoma masses showed up on a routine mri they were visible in his spinal fluid at the lower middle and upper back because the upper mass was so large it threatened to compress nerves in joey s spine and cause paralysis in his arms it prompted joey s team of doctors to begin chemotherapy immediately the chemotherapy drugs he was administered were best known to destroy this type of cancer and yet they only stood a little better than a 50 chance of being effective it was the best treatment option at that point because it had the most limited side effects after a seven week cycle completed the week of christmas 07 the masses still grew in size and joey began to experience back pain he was put on some pretty strong steroids to alleviate the pressure currently joey is undergoing radiation treatment to his spine to destroy these masses and to prevent reoccurrence he will have an mri at the end of february to look at the progress joey is an exceptional 3 and year old he is gracious considerate and rather conservative it may take him a little while to warm up to you but if you get him going you d find that he is quite the conversationalist he loves to play games and draw and always feels that the more the merrier he likes to be assured of things he is not yet familiar with but he is very brave it is inspiring to know what he has gone through and continues to endure without being sad or mad or show even a sign of being discouraged when it comes to getting a new medicine maintain his central line have a medical procedure check up or treatment he accepts it as a part of his life and does his best to learn about it so that he can help he cherishes family and friends and to know him is to love him

2328080 its waynes choice not to talk to the media and i support that maybe in the future if he is refereeing a match in new zealand there may be some media
2328081 but not for this match it would serve no point
2328082 i woke up and heard a loud bang from a car or shotgun i waited for a bit then heard loud scraping noises like someone was dragging something along the ground
2328083 it was definitely manila i asked her where she was and she said manila in the philippines
2328084 if you dial 111 theres no way you can be routed through to manila
2328085 if the oa asks the right questions then it would be hard to hide assets or income
2328086 there are legitimate mechanisms by which a trust can indirectly support a bankrupt
2328087 we can put unmanned aircraft predator reaper and other assets overhead for long endurance periods we call that persistent stare iraq for the first time july 17 from balad air base and has been flying in
2328088 we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements and i stress complements our incredible manned capacity today
2328089 so my task is to figure out which asset you use where and why to get the best effect in the battlespace

2328093 she is sick of all her problems being on everyone elses lips and really wants to focus on other people for a change
2328094 and she can help her dad pick some tracks while she is there
2328095 so when are you going to get a real job

2328097 in order to make good decisions you need to have a framework for your security program
2328098 wealth has never yet sacrificed itself on the altar of patriotism
2328099 my phone has been ringing off the hook with landowners who have been trying to years to get this plant out of their backyard and they havent been able to figure out how to do it
2328100 so we are trying to help out residents to learn the different methods and techniques of eradicating elephant ears
2328101 pulls the plant every day out of his garden because it keeps creeping in and attacking his tomatoes
2328102 just a small piece of stem or root can start a whole new colony
2328103 you cant just cut it and compost it you have to cut it and bag it until the plant is dead and then you might be able to burn it or compost it
2328104 were particularly concerned about it in the park because its also started getting into the riverbanks
2328105 shades out that natural vegetation thats really good at holding the soil
2328106 as good at stabilizing the riverbank and when we get heavy rains especially like weve had this past week a lot of that bank starts to fall into the river theres a high sediment load so it makes it tough for the fish and the aquatic insects that are living in that river to survive
2328107 weve had great success with injecting herbicide into the stem so the herbicide doesnt get into the surrounding environment
2328108 it kills the really deep root system and it also kills the crown weve managed to remove about a third of the plants from the park in just about a year which is incredible success
2328109 the largest colony we have growing is about a half to three quarters of an acre and it takes over and theres nothing else growing in that plot

2328115 hell be better suited to six and a half furlongs 1300m and longer
2328116 but horses with a bit of class can do things they shouldnt do
2328117 and thats why he was able to run the fastest two year old trial at warwick farm when hes not even a speed horse
2328118 hes going to be at his most vulnerable over this trip but theyll know hes in the race thats for sure
2328119 this is a big step up but ive got big plans for the horse races like the roman consul ming dynasty and the caulfield guineas
2328120 and i havent ruled out switching over and looking at the golden rose if his fitness is right

2328176 the look and feel of a website is not what a consumer should trust they should trust the security behind that website and do simple things like use more secure passwords and change their password regularly
2328177 we have anticipated these flaws in dns for many years and we have basically engineered around them
2328178 its been overplayed in a sense i think it has served to confuse the consumer into believing there is somehow now a way to misdirect them to a wrong site

2328185 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
2328186 if you can convince 5 judges that the law is not fair it violates the common law right to privacy and is therefore unconstitutional
2328187 an air about it of pushing people around insisting on your way
2328188 that was the coolest thing ive done in a long time
2328189 it all depends on what the meaning of is is

2328194 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
2328195 these troops that are in georgia now they didnt come unexpectedly
2328196 they had been amassing at the border for the last few months they claimed they were staging exercises there and as soon as a suitable pretext was found they moved in
2328197 they have two goals to do a creeping annexation of south ossetia and abkhazia and secondly to overthrow saakashvili who is a tremendous thorn in their side

2328200 we probably will be talking about this man the rest of our lives
2328201 of course our kids know not to talk or receive things from strangers
2328202 but i saw warmth in his eyes so we walked over to him
2328203 his few words nearly took our breath away because genas fathers name was also alan and he also had a very similar gentle and kind demeanor but her father had passed away six months earlier and still is missed so dearly
2328204 i dont think its a coincidence today that santa cruz means holy cross in spanish
2328205 ok dad you dont have to make it anymore obvious than this
2328206 nothing happens by chance it was meant for us to see him
2328207 its extremely helpful in some small way to counteract the incredibly negative attitude toward chronically homeless people on the streets

2328209 but you shall receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses to me in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the end of the earth
2328210 and being assembled together with them he commanded them not to depart from jerusalem but to wait for the promise of the father which he said you have heard from me for john truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy spirit not many days from now
2328211 it is not for you to know times or seasons which the father has put in his own authority

2328217 for all we know the citizen complaint was rank hearsay and not based on personal knowledge

2328222 hes probably got the most corporate memory right now of anybody on the budget
2328223 i came to sacramento to get things done and thats what my focus is and at the same time i really love people and have worked hard to build relationships
2328224 obviously from a philosophical perspective theres a bit of a distance between us but he has the ability to disagree without being disagreeable and is eminently fair in his approach to policy discussions
2328225 ive never seen john playing politics for the sake of politics
2328226 hes an honest person whos going to give you the straightforward perspective
2328227 john is easily one of the best politicians in the history of santa cruz
2328228 he not only takes on multibillion dollar structural deficits in california but also is willing to engage in issues like whether off leash dogs can continue to use the beach here in santa cruz

2328316 the recruiters had a table at my high school every time we had a college day they were there

2328374 dr means was a pillar of the african american community at a time when it was very underrepresented politically
2328375 when i was at the university of texas during the late 1960s several of us students spent a lot of time in the kitchen of the means home working on mailings and door to door voter registration efforts he inspired a lot of youthful enthusiasm among us to see that travis county better reflected its diversity
2328376 he was an excellent teacher and a father figure to me
2328377 well yeah ill work for you but you see ive got this trip ive been planning for about eight months to china for a month
2328378 i feel like the music were making is not just a response but is actually an antidote to living in new york
2328379 i think living in a place like colorado where everyone moves slower where theres more space people desire more aggression in their music because they have all the relaxation built into their normal daily lives so when kids want to go out and experience a really cool thing at night they want to be messed with they want to get sweaty they want to get angry they want to see something really out there and crazy and really loud and abrasive
2328380 living in new york you experience that all day every day youre packed in together with a lot of other people youre exposed to a lot of ambient noise all the time with the transportation with the sirens and the streets and everything at the end of the day when you want to go out and relax and have an interesting experience you dont feel so much desire to go get messed with you instead want to be hypnotized or be drugged or be transported or escape from the conditions via the music that you listen to at night
2328381 none of us really listen to that much 80s music
2328382 our memories of 80s music as kids have gotten filtered through the music we listened to during the 90s and 2000s all the music we listen to gets melded together into an intuitive blob
2328383 it was a combination of sort of an acoustic sound with lo fi electronics like casio keyboards and really basic synthesizer sounds with a folk pop song structure
2328384 we started getting a lot of other influences into our music everything from prog to classic rock and experimental noise and free jazz
2328385 so that kind of deconstructed the way we were looking at writing now were after more of an ambiance in our music a mood instead of a structure or thematic its a way of making people feel that were after
2328386 i am so happy and grateful now that and then explain how you want your life to be in every area
2328387 with all that i have read and all that i have experienced in my own life using the secret the power of gratitude stands above everything else if you do only one thing with the knowledge of the secret use gratitude until it becomes your way of life

2328391 without doubt this years sale will have the best quality line up ever offered at a breeze up style sale of this kind in australia
2328392 this is australasias number one sale last year we boasted a record average price and youngsters sold to 275 000
2328393 the second highest priced lot of the sale a colt by giants causeway and from group one winner love de tor recently was an impressive winner on debut in brisbane
2328394 hes got to prove hes up to this class first but if he goes well id like to take him to melbourne
2328395 ill need to talk with ron first about going south but hes nominated for the caulfield guineas which is not until october
2328396 if he wins on saturday then he should just about have enough prizemoney to get into the caulfield guineas but if he doesnt then we could always take him to sydney first
2328397 it was a very impressive win and it was only his second race start
2328398 he looks like hes a very good horse and he went from 1100 metres in his first start at doomben to 1400 metres when he won last start
2328399 im not sure what campaign to give him if he does go south but id hope to give him at least one run in melbourne before the guineas
2328400 hes going great hes done everything ive asked of him since his eagle farm win and he should give a good account of himself again
2328401 he has to make the step up in class from the midweeks but hell need to if we intend to take him away
2328402 its not going to be easy for my bloke i know they have a big opinion of tearsncheers and he shows a lot of promise
2328403 i think he is working better than he did last campaign
2328404 there are a couple of fair horses in the auries star but he is coming along well
2328405 i keep him to the straight tracks when i can
2328406 i probably would have been happier if it had been 1100 metres or 1000 metres but i think he will run well
2328407 the record distribution of 300 million shows both the resilience of the victorian racing industry and the strength of the joint venture with tabcorp it is a great credit to all participants

2328420 thats something well find out later on but shes shaping up well for this race
2328421 shes got so much ability as weve all seen but i want to make sure we dont get too far ahead of ourselves the old cliche of one race at a time certainly applies to her

2328428 like you i find these camps intolerable but i find equally intolerable the use made of them every day in the bourgeois press
2328429 the fopc inference model is extremely intolerant of inconsistency i e p x amp not p x gt q the semantic web has to tolerate many kinds of inconsistency toleration of inconsistecy can only be done by fuzzy systems we need a semantic web which will provide guarantees and about which one can reson with logic a fuzzy system might be good for finding a proof but then it should be able to go back and justify each deduction logically to produce a proof in the unifying hol language which anyone can check any real sw system will work not by believing anything it reads on the web but by checking the source of any information i wish people would learn to do this on the web as it is so in fact a rule will allow a system to infer things only from statements of a particular form signed by particular keys within such a system an inconsistency is a serious problem not something to worked around if my bank says my bank balance is 100 and my computer says it is 200 then we need to figure out the problem same with launching missiles imho the semantic web model is that a uri dereferences to a document which parses to a directed labeled graph of statements the statements can have uris as prameters so they can may statements about documents and about other statements so you can express trust and reason about it and limit your information to trusted consistent data

2328440 software engineering should be more like traditional engineering more repeatable
2328441 well engineering as a discipline is much older than software so of course it has a much stronger analytical approach i e maths
2328442 consider two identical library systems both which have a schema with the concept of editions of a work both of which are defined by the same rdf uri
2328443 in using the data from these identical systems all you have is a set of descriptions and the description source system a or system b most of these descriptions match but some of them are inconsistent on what basis do you ascribe a different uri
2328444 one person using system a might have used a stricter form of the concept work but another user of system a the same system may have used a wider concept of work on other records
2328445 only enter town names corresponding to those approved by the post office
2328446 dont these people read manuals or the help file for their system
2328447 i am not proposing any fpoc or hol inference engine
2328448 the goal of the semantic web is to express real life many things in real life real questions which we will face are not efficiently computable
2328449 create subsets of the web in which specific constraints give you specific computational properties
2328450 what i dont understand is why the semantic web community appears to be bent on removing inconsistency
2328451 but ian here you have again chosen an example where there is a single authority that defines the one version of the truth for postal address the post office so any inconsistency in this case can be considered user error this is not typical
2328452 if the semantic web solution to these inconsistencies is better user training then i think that is a real issue surely having an approach that is less sensitive to inconsistency is a better way than trying to change user behaviour
2328453 they have a frequent buyer program i dont know what the criteria is where you get rewards and i shop at eddie bauer a lot
2328454 it included a one piece that said the forthcoming fall collection is inspired by paws up i took it out put it on the keyboard of my computer and sent an email to corporate communications with lots of links to news stories back when the resort was in the news for various things
2328455 what i want to know is did they do any due diligence
2328456 there are so many worthwhile places if they want to tie into a montana entity theres the rolling dog ranch they rescue injured animals
2328457 theres also camp mak a dream a beautiful spot that does great work for kids who need it
2328458 i just wanted to let them know that as a dedicated long time customer that i dont like it im not going to stop doing business with eddie bauer absolutely not but to my mind at least they could have made a better choice
2328459 why such a backlash from a few locals over a silly phrase
2328460 celebrate the spirit and beauty of the state of montana
2328461 the propositions of the tractatus are meaningless not profound insights ethical or otherwise

2328475 with more people coming to kyle we have a responsibility to take care of them
2328476 our police and fire entities in kyle have to have proper personnel equipment and training to keep up with the growth
2328477 we need to get the people staying in kyle to spend their money in kyle that way kyle benefits in tax dollars
2328478 buda has a lot more sales tax revenue than kyle but kyle has more people than buda
2328479 i would like to pursue some kind of alternative transportation to austin whether through capital metro or the metro rail line that is being planned just something to alleviate some of that burden
2328480 that affect taxes within kyle but it will if we keep increasing our debt load
2328481 kites returned to most areas of afghanistan after the taliban government left office in 2002 when american troops entered the country
2328482 it seems like time stopped here 2 000 years ago we see these kids running around with nothing not even shoes and we want to change that
2328483 i know people looking in from the outside will ask why someone like me keeps working so hard
2328484 but a few million doesnt go as far as it used to maybe in the 70s a few million bucks meant lifestyles of the rich and famous or richie rich living in a big house with a butler but not anymore
2328485 its just like wall street where there are all these financial guys worth 7 million wondering whats so special about them when there are all these guys worth in the hundreds of millions of dollars
2328486 people around here if they have 2 or 3 million dollars they dont feel secure
2328487 they recognize that if they happened to walk into a different office
2328488 it never feels like you do because thats a lot of money
2328489 i dont know how people live here on just a normal salary
2328490 people here lose perspective on what the rest of the world looks like
2328491 people would seek me out for boards but here im a dime a dozen
2328492 but if you do that then youre admitting defeat no one wants to go backwards
2328493 you see how much money you have in the bank
2328494 there are all these people who come to you for money
2328495 siblings parents other relatives organizations seeking charitable contributions theres this assumption you have all this money so why dont you write a big check to the school or to this other charity
2328496 here the top 1 percent chases the top one tenth of 1 percent and the top one tenth of 1 percent chases the top one one hundredth of 1 percent
2328497 i cant see germaine or me winning the prize as it would perhaps be seen as subsidising ex pats
2328498 i presume it will be judged on merit but the rest of the list is very strong
2328499 hes a man of considerable intellect im rather sorry i didnt write my book in chinese as he reads chinese
2328500 its always an excellent idea for australia to offer prizes i think they are better than subsidies
2328501 australia is a big reading country per capita but it has a small population
2328502 the market is hardly big enough to support an author so prizes really mean something
2328503 an impressive indication of the outstanding breadth and quality of modern australian literature
2328504 but i really want a heathered blue heathers are so much more fun to knit what about this one
2328505 it is very important to remind our people and the world that although we havent seen change we expect it to come soon
2328506 the recent cyclone and floods the terrible damage they have done to peoples lives and the incredibly negative and defensive response of the military regime there to all the offers of help from many countries around the world makes it clear how insecure and inadequate the military regime is

2328534 there were over 5 000 signatures on this recall petition so clearly the citizens of manhattan beach want to see this on the ballot
2328535 when he was elected in 2005 he got about 3 150 votes
2328536 so there were 2 000 more valid signatures to recall him than he received votes when he ran
2328537 it would seem to me if 22 percent of the registered voters in town would sign a petition that probably the folks in town
2328538 i would estimate a good percentage of those people do not vote in municipal elections
2328539 lots of people will sign a petition it doesnt mean theyre going to vote for or against it

2328556 i was very passionate in my conversation i was very assertive
2328557 i did say i thought the earth was being raped here and plants and animals were being killed
2328558 fish and game did do surveys ahead of time very recent studies and they didnt find any of the species roy and marcia were referring to

2328562 what i saw there was not what i read friday morning in ohare airport that its a kosher jungle i saw a state of the art plant
2328563 i told these people im here to listen and to help
2328564 i was telling them that i sat at my desk on many occasions and heard this for many years when you hear the same thing over and over again you know it cant be fabricated and there has to be some substance to it
2328565 as of this moment the rabbis are awaiting documentation of the alleged abuses to workers of the agriprocessors plant
2328566 the plant theyre describing to me and the plant ive had workers describe to me is not same facility

2328568 this isnt about government getting involved in what people should eat
2328569 were providing information for people to make decisions based on that information
2328570 most of our customers do want it available but they dont want to have to see it every time they go out to eat
2328571 if the calorie information was up on the order board i think parents would make different decisions
2328572 this would be an important tipping point in the fight against this scourge

2328578 everybody was ducking for cover and my wife stopped and the next thing i know she said i got shot
2328579 the suspect was running away no longer posing a threat to the remainder of the crowd but the suspect then took a shot at him
2328580 i heard a snap and a couple two three seconds later another five or six shots
2328581 the guy was running out he ran to my nephew and the guy shot at him its a good thing my nephew didnt get hurt
2328582 security shoot him in the back and he fall down on the ground and they shoot him right on the neck

2328589 janitorial services are provided by an outside contractor and as a matter of policy we dont get involved in the labor relations of our contractors and suppliers
2328590 we feel both sides are bargaining in earnest and were working long hours
2328591 three years ago there were several sides that were being run by nonunion contractors
2328592 and so the union i think had more at stake in trying to organize those sides and bring those companies to the bargaining table and they did succeed in that
2328593 this was a project that was in perpetual negotiation for years and our board made a commitment early on to move it forward
2328594 so we are very pleased to follow through on that promise
2328595 i continue to be heartbroken by the ports removal of the youth sailing facility it just disappeared off the charts

2328597 we know the market is there in the inland empire
2328598 the market will become real in a regional setting after we modernize lax and pass the cost on to the airlines
2328599 if moving north is the only option then well take a deep breath and consider it in a serious manner
2328600 i dont want to just see the green line go to lax i want to see it down at hermosa beach so folks in the south bay will use it too
2328601 so the 64 000 question becomes who do these weapons belong to
2328602 they were content to lay these weapons on mr sisneros

2328609 he laid the foundation for the southern california beach culture

2328616 alchemy of trading is a bit different from those weve reviewed before although stephen vita posts plenty of breaking market news and related charts vita who has an mba and has been trading professionally for 15 years presents a stream of consciousness in his multiple daily posts also shares commentary on his own portfolio and trades a better tool for experienced investors who can blend this conversation in with their own studied experience

2328629 qualifying for the olympics was a challenge because i had only two years to make a lot of points to be there and i had zero from the start
2328630 now i have achieved any athletes dream which is the olympic my life had changed a lot after that especially with press because my first match is against brazil all the work that i have put in has paid off
2328631 brazil can only send two teams to the olympics and they have around seven teams fighting for those spots

2328635 on the first day of pads there is always an emphasis on fundamentals
2328636 also from an installation standpoint we put in short yardage and goal line areas where we werent very good last year we were very poor on third down and one and very poor once we got down inside the two yard line of punching it in
2328637 weve done a lot of evaluating on what we need to do schematically and what players we need to depend on in those situations its something we worked on in the spring and hopefully we will be a little better this fall

2328663 one cannot claim to be an animal protection advocate and threaten violence against other people even if we disagree with what they are doing

2328669 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
2328670 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
2328671 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
2328672 state and federal courts on three separate occasions have already satisfied the world courts suggestion that american courts examine whether medellin suffered actual legal harm when authorities did not inform him about certain rights under the vienna convention
2328673 on all three occasions state and federal courts concluded that medellin suffered no legal harm
2328674 nonetheless chi faces execution in a matter of hours without any court having addressed the merits of his interpretation
2328675 two days after medellin execution similar issues back at high court
2328676 the burden justice tom price cited included the supreme courts ruling in 2006 in sanchez llamas v oregon another vienna convention case saying that a treaty could override state procedural rules only if the agreement contained a clear statement doing so price found no such statement

2328678 i think the argument we have is a good one
2328679 it was the first day with shoulder pads on and it was extremely hot
2328680 the first time you put those pads on its like putting on a monster it really tests your mind but it was nice to get out there start knocking some licks around its a good way to gain toughness usually the most physical teams win consistently it was a good physical practice
2328681 we had some good hitting going on but now its a matter of getting the tempo going
2328682 the tempo was not quite were we wanted it today the combination of the heat and the pads being on and you have to get in physical shape for that
2328683 in every practice from here out were going to down and distance everything theyre going to start understanding situations

2328712 the government of mexico sent the u s department of state a diplomatic note of protest for this violation of international law expressing its concern for the precedent that it may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
2328713 the ministry of foreign relations reiterates that the importance of this case fundamentally stems from the respect to the right to consular access and protection provided by consulates of every state to each of its nationals abroad
2328714 we continue to seek a practical and timely way to carry out our nations international legal obligation

2328751 at the time of the custody transfer it was reported by jacks court ordered therapist that a bond had not been formed yet between jack and his father
2328752 this past march it was relayed in my presence by the guardian ad litem the court appointed professional who was hired to look out for my sons best interests and well being and by my sons therapist during a deposition that until i believe jacks father could never hurt jack it is too dangerous for jack to have unsupervised visitation with me
2328753 i stated to jacks therapist that i purposefully did not ask jack what happened to his eye even after jack confided in the day care worker a young man jack had grown close to and trusted
2328754 i did not ask jack anything primarily because i was afraid i would get accused of planting seeds in jacks head
2328755 no one can prepare you for the experience of custody litigation i didnt see any of what was coming next
2328756 jack and i need our communitys help to bring him home my son deserves his right to a safe and happy childhood
2328757 we have heard a lot of disputed and inconclusive testimony regarding this so called injury dr erich junger couldnt determine exactly how it happened but thats not the real issue for this court
2328758 the issue is whether or not the guardian ad litem took active steps to protect the father in conflict of interest with her ward
2328759 when i spoke to the investigator from the warren county sheriffs office i dont remember saying the child was coerced
2328760 i told him the child protective services investigation was ongoing and implored him to investigate further and to hear all of the facts i told him it appeared the child was being coached and that it was not in the childs best interest to testify against his father in a criminal case
2328761 the childs story was consistent that he hurt his eye when he fell out of bed until he taped that conversation with his mother then his stories were all over the map
2328762 in this case i felt the child was being barraged by his mother every time he talked to someone about his injury
2328763 she has been his advocate she advocates for what she thinks is in her wards best interest the guardian ad litem system has worked there is certainly no credible evidence she has done anything wrong in this case
2328764 while we have continued to implement price increases in this segment they have not been adequate to offset the higher input costs
2328765 in the long term we continue to think that theyll do fine and be able to grow earnings but when corn is up as much as it is on a year over year basis theres just no escape from this kind of pressure

2328796 several years ago mia farrow asked if she could accompany me on a trip to darfur i didnt know her then and didnt like the idea of traveling with an actress who would probably need a blow dryer and flinch at the dirt and danger so mia went on her own again and again and again becoming a passionate and knowledgeable spokeswoman for darfur on her website www miafarrow org she has some of the best photos available of the janjaweed and she took them herself i think that i rough it in darfur and chad because i sometimes have to sleep outside but i take a light sleeping bag a tarp and occasionally a tent all mia carries is a rope she puts the rope in a circle in the sand and goes to sleep in the sand in the middle of that circle she claims that if scorpions approach theyll hit the rope and keep going around rather than climbing over it its true that the scorpions and camel spiders havent bitten her but i think thats just because they respect a great humanitarian when i go to darfur or chad i rent a car mia is talking about buying a donkey and just going cross country in short shes ten times tougher than i am and im full of admiration for her courage and dedication im not sure i would last long traveling with her so now mia is again among the darfuris shell be offering a glimpse of what the darfuris are going through during the olympics in part because of chinas refusal to take the issue seriously shell be webcasting daily reports as well as blogging so take a look at them at www darfurolympics org and think of mia out there in a dangerous area standing up for the people of darfur when the international community has forsaken them and all she has is her rope the olympics havent even started but in my book shes a gold medalist

2328799 geisel denied in a written statement to a secret service agent that he ever made those threats and the documents dont indicate that he ever took steps to carry out any assassination he was charged only with threatening obama the presumptive democratic nominee but not for any threat against president bush
2328800 did state however that if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking

2328812 because her professional background includes a substitute judgeship that followed her service as a juvenile and domestic relations district court judge for the city of richmond her thoughts on this issue would interest me
2328813 i am willing to bet she never gave up her trial practice when appointed substitute judge years back working both sides of the bench is unethical and should not be rewarded with a full time bench spot and substitute judges have no business manning judicial reappointment committees
2328814 the people of virginia are safer with more slots to accommodate more full time sitting judges than with our current system of relying on practicing trial lawyers to work both sides of the bench
2328815 i was jailed when i stopped showing up for vexatious attacks no judge was willing to dismiss amp sanction when appropriate judges instead seized the 7862 bail my brother posted on my behalf amp gave it to the sub judge lawyer to pay her churned legal fees the money my childs father spent in one summer to maliciously prosecute me
2328816 a total of eighteen motions were filed by three fairfax county substitute judges in one month michael devine steven garver and bruce white separately submitted six motions to share the lead for the most motions filed in march by substitute judges the three are from among seventeen competing attorneys who were selected by a 19th judicial circuit chief judge and the committee on district courts to serve as subs that is to both rule on cases and represent clients often in the same courthouse

2328821 he said the state paid the cousins 850 as baby sitters
2328822 justice brent benjamin asked if the orders included any findings on the mothers fitness
2328823 why does a natural parent have to prove fitness when she has never been found unfit
2328824 that doesnt mean youre giving up custody of the child

2328839 the fact is that secular music speaks to people seekers unchurched and churched alike because many secular songs articulate universal human needs the reason so many songs are written about love is because its a universal desire and one that the bible affirms when it tells us that gods very nature is love a secular song in church is so attractive then because every attendee is likely to be familiar with it and comfortable listening to its truth most people expect a teacher to use non biblical stories to illustrate a biblical truth at saddleback we use secular songs as illustrations pointing people to biblical truth

2328846 he was indeed a strange mixture of temperament his moods ranging from the gravest seriousness to the gayest humour but anyone who knew only this side of friedrichs personality namely his deep melancholic seriousness only knew half the man i have met few people who have such a gift for telling jokes and such a sense of fun as he did providing that he was in the company of people he liked
2328847 what the newer landscape artists see in a circle of a hundred degrees in nature they press together unmercifully into an angle of vision of only forty five degrees and furthermore what is in nature separated by large spaces is compressed into a cramped space and overfills and oversatiates the eye creating an unfavorable and disquieting effect on the viewer
2328848 close your bodily eye so that you may see your picture first with the spiritual eye then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards

2328864 the economy is heading for a significant slowdown or even a recession
2328865 the mpc continues to be pulled in opposing directions by rising inflation and slowing growth
2328866 since the nationwide cut its rates others have been bringing their rates down too
2328867 i think theres not an insignificant chance of an interest rate rise primarily because the quarterly inflation report is out this month and one member of the mpc has said that it is a good time to explain a rate rise
2328868 with inflation rising a hike this month could be one last signal from the bank of its commitment to bring inflation down while i predict a no change tomorrow a move in rates is not inconceivable
2328869 if they are to move its more likely to go up than down
2328870 the mpc have been caught between rising inflation and slowing growth and the battle between the two has been getting more intense over the past few months now its going to be the worst its ever been

2328901 its possible that there was some connection to a drug deal
2328902 he presented as being sexualized well beyond his years and gave a recitation of the events surrounding his abuse which was chilling in its routine use of sexual words and phrases
2328903 i have no hesitation in concluding that the sexual degradation of the child by the accused has had a very detrimental effect
2328904 this case presents itself as a portrait of the devastating consequences of child sexual abuse
2328905 so illogical and preposterous as to lead to the conclusion it was concocted in an effort to explain away very damning evidence
2328906 you need to look at the underlying issues of why you think the way you do why you relapse
2328907 i just had a momentary lapse i thought it was ok i thought i could have a beer
2328908 you didnt speak about the victim when you were talking not once
2328909 i lost my son again i cant do anything about it i never had him
2328910 if he cant stay away from it hes going to get into trouble again
2328911 when he was 12 or 13 i used to beg him to play
2328912 he said dad golf is boring and its too slow he couldnt get the ball off the ground
2328913 my dad is the only swing coach ive ever had
2328914 if he has any complications hell come to me but he has a really solid solid golf swing
2328915 he doesnt get himself in trouble its just a matter a how many putts he makes
2328916 i couldnt motivate him as well as his history teacher
2328917 the passion for the sport the love of competition the desire to get better i get that from him
2328918 hes always been a class individual on the golf course i dont have to worry about him carrying on ive seen him in action im very very proud of him
2328919 its providing equipment to often debt loaded graduates and its quite a clear way for them to address the doctor shortage doctors often end up wanting to stay where they train
2328920 its the narrowest part and the most water pressure comes through and the only way we could end up getting a bridge in here was if it was designed to blow off when the water came through
2328921 its all new stuff and a big learning curve to see how we go
2328922 i have wanted a dog ever since i was about eight and she was cute i felt sorry for her
2328923 she doesnt like to be away from me so she just always comes and stays around me
2328924 he knows the code very well and he has decided not to abide by it
2328925 i never prevent them talking to the media its just a courtesy if all councillors went to the media to express their views it would be chaos
2328926 if he had i could have told him it was only the start of the process i think some of the comments that were made were misleading there is an opportunity for ratepayers to have their say
2328927 as far as i can recall we updated the rules during his mayoral term it was highlighted during toms term because it was quite turbulent
2328928 i will speak to him hes not on notice i dont operate that way
2328929 has something changed since ive been away theres a councillor that hasnt been at meetings but has got his opinion in the paper
2328930 the temperature is taking quite a dive and the message is this is much colder than weve seen for a while with some snow showers but its unlikely to cause any major problems

2328936 sure weve been talking smack between us about the game and were looking forward to it theyll be my enemies for three hours or so after that well display that centerville football camaraderie and reminisce
2328937 growing up in centerville and starting to play in the sixth grade i was always more of a tackling dummy than a player
2328938 i didnt play a single down of high school football as a sophomore most players would have quit but i stayed in the game because i love the sport so much
2328939 i went down on a whim and they liked what they saw
2328940 i ran a 4 7 second 40 yard dash coach elson wanted more information from me after that
2328941 i wanted him on my team ill never forget watching him on film after his senior season he played the hardest of anybody ive seen
2328942 i was stoked and intercepted a pass on the first play of the game and it happened in front of my family
2328943 i pointed toward them after the play it just seemed like something that was frozen in time
2328944 it was a tough time for me but you find out who your friends are
2328945 a lot of my former teammates at centerville helped me through it
2328946 my words to live by are be relentless with what you want in life be thankful for what you have
2328947 i take pride in giving back to the community he said
2328948 i enjoy visiting hospitals schools and churches i want to make a difference after our home games i catch a little grief from my teammates because im always working the crowd meeting and greeting our fans theyve given me so much i want to repay them
2328949 there is just a special spirit here in bowling green that is hard to describe and im glad i inherited it

2328952 its the sixth most used heading of all headings in the yellow pages
2328953 apparently that made a lot of lawyers mad in dallas
2328954 the idea behind an lrs is to help people find a reputable lawyer
2328955 i think both sides have been reasonable and i think weve reached a reasonable compromise for fort worth at least

2328979 its unfortunate that a city official would question the truthfulness of our elected officials and our past and present staff
2328980 it always was our intent to fund a study that encompassed only the city and township
2328981 we also stand by our statistics regarding the two future road projects and it should be noted that a city unlike a township will not be able to rely on the county for funding assistance
2328982 these are not misconceptions on the part of the township as the city manager has asserted
2328983 the bottom line is that all county roads would become the liability of the merged government
2328984 the city and township have shared information about residents reaction to merger the township has received a great deal of citizen response in opposition to any discussions of a merger resulting in a formation of citizen group washington twp forever
2328985 according to residents ive spoken to the city has hired local college students to campaign door to door to solicit signatures for a fall ballot issue that would create a merger study commission
2328986 this does not appear to be a grassroots movement where volunteers are knocking on doors
2328987 duplicate government services would be eliminated saving tax payers even more money
2328988 a great deal of information is being exchanged during this time
2328989 we really played great competition the best weve ever played
2328990 we went 34 0 we beat princeton twice they beat us in the district by two points last season garfield heights is a highly touted team too
2328991 our philosophy is that teams are made in the summer not during the season
2328992 this will give us a great jump start we really pushed the envelope as far as playing tough competition
2328993 the players spend one hour in the weight room getting stronger jumping higher and getting faster
2328994 then we practice winning and playing as a team in these shootouts
2328995 i havent seen him get outplayed by anybody hes stronger heavier just a better player and a better shooter
2328996 whether it will all translate into a great season well just have to wait and see
2328997 but i like what we did our kids have an incredible work ethic and continue to play beyond expectations
2328998 we are all way more alike than we are different its all about seeing ourselves through each other
2328999 who does this late queen think she is she aint nothin but a fake ass
2329000 hey whats up remember me from the beach prolly not but whats good i recognized the floral shorts from the main pic lol
2329001 im good i just visited your blog you seem like a pretty semi intelligent stand up down to earth kind a guy im sure its so major flaw hidden way deep down in the matrix but none the less i just wanted to bid you a hello and see whats was really good
2329002 i just feel like i have to label you as semi intelligent bcuz you seem to be known as a gay socialite and from the two times your name slipped from the lips not everything that was mentioned about u was applaud worthy
2329003 weve all done things and have pasts none of us are squeaky clean i just decided to be real about mine and have managed to inspire some people along the way as for those who dont like me and talk about me i think its great if i werent talked about or hated then id worry
2329004 contrary to popular both sides of the spectrum are completely debatable i tend to lean running opposite of the crowd instead of with i boast on being different maybe im naiive but i think squeaky clean exist it about thinking and considering the consequence before acting you are supposed to look before your leap and thats what makes me different having a past a beautiful thing prasing yourself for making hebetudinous mistake is what i have a problem with along with lacking the ambition to not repeat the same stupid mistakes
2329005 well if youre gonna this deep you cant talk in riddles
2329006 we are all way more alike than we are different its all about seeing ourselves through each other
2329007 i feel like my purpose in life is to serve people
2329008 its not work to me at all i just enjoy every day i get a natural high
2329009 were right in the middle of the state just before you reach the thousand lakes area
2329010 people here ask me how i do it getting up at five in the morning to get to work at panera bread but its no big deal ive always gotten up early
2329011 i started as a server at the olive garden then became a server trainer and finally was promoted to a manager
2329012 i wasnt happy as a manager id rather take less pay and work with customers im just so happy being a server its my niche
2329013 i thought my family needed me and i had no one down here but after i returned home i realized that they didnt need me and i have a family of friends here
2329014 were america were so sorry to have hurt this guys feelings were so sorry that he had to suffer at gitmo were just so sorry that this happened at all were over zealous we know we have nothing to fear and sending strong messages to those who want us dead isnt nice
2329015 they were going to take care of my three babies my husband and i were going to have a couple of nights away together
2329016 i started getting worried i remember i had a real panicked feeling
2329017 in one sense he was the epitome of the absent minded professor but he was extremely bright interested not only in his own field but he had a wide knowledge in all aspects of things academic and cultural
2329018 she had a gas burning stove that only partially worked but somehow she could serve these elaborate gourmet meals for large groups of people
2329019 i heard this terrible thump and i saw the car continue on
2329020 they were hit before i could turn enough to see them
2329021 i heard this terrible thump and i saw the car continue on without any effort at all to stop there was no horn blowing there was no screeching of brakes
2329022 i started hollering i just started hollering to call 911
2329023 there wasnt a heck of a lot i could do despite my training in the field
2329024 they said your mother is in the hospital at harbor general and then they told me that my father had been killed
2329025 i told her you are going to be fine im going to take care of you i remember her telling me her feet were cold she couldnt really talk that was all she said
2329026 when she passed away it was a huge shock for us
2329027 they were both reasonably healthy we were certainly expecting they would live another 10 or 15 years
2329028 he stated that he thought that his brother had gone to church but that his brother had not returned
2329029 according to martin lopez his brother had told him that he had run over some pedestrians who were in the crosswalk at fourth and pacific and that he had gotten scared and run and that he was presently in mexico
2329030 we have a file of old cold cases and they are revisited every so often
2329031 when i got it it was a very thick file nobody had looked at it for many years it hit something and i decided i wanted to pursue it a little bit
2329032 if he would have stayed it would have been a bad accident it was late at night it was raining it became a crime when he left
2329033 he knew he was in big trouble so he never showed
2329034 i believe hes back here somewhere he could have changed his name
2329035 i was angry for a while and then that sort of disappeared over a period of time
2329036 i was more concerned with the rehabilitation of my wife and getting on with our lives
2329037 he was a new hire and she was helping him out and showing where his office was and how to get supplies thats how they met
2329038 he would get invited to attend conferences and give talks they went to sweden they went to sardinia they went to korea they did some travel to attend scientific meetings
2329039 i figured theyd be around to see my children go off to college
2329040 i wanted to tell that person what they took away
2329041 i wanted to tell him how much it hurt me the pain that it caused
2329042 i wanted him to feel it i wanted him to get an understanding if he felt that kind of pain he would never do such a thing again i wanted him to feel my pain
2329043 a principle that is applied to residential broadband networks and potentially to all networks a neutral broadband network is one that is free of restrictions on the kinds of equipment that may be attached on the modes of communication allowed which does not restrict content sites or platforms and where communication is not unreasonably degraded by other communication streams
2329044 do not wait until your application is built before you create and test the production environment
2329045 like the dozens of other jailed syrian activists aref dalila should never have been arrested in the first place
2329046 hes finally free but far too many others languish in syrias prisons just because they criticized the government
2329047 syria needs to stop its revolving door detention policy of arresting an activist each time another is released
2329048 its time for president bashar al asad to recognize the right of syrians to criticize his policies
2329049 he had an opportunity to step in as a starting tailback and did a great job when we had an injury to a senior
2329050 when the senior came back tim had solidified the position hes definitely going to be a focal point for our offense
2329051 hes a sharp kid a great kid in the classroom so he basically lived up to our expectations
2329052 justin is a young man who was a linebacker and has moved forward he has grown into his body a little bit
2329053 tommy grove is trying to grow a little bit more hes contacted us a little bit this summer about gaining weight
2329054 both of those young men are hard working and we expect them to see some time on our defensive line this year
2329055 harbaugh is as gracious and open as brian was so its been good im sorry brian got let go but im a homer ill root for them
2329056 i dont think its fair to a guy like juniata head coach darrell alt who i know is a great coach because hes been on my staff ive seen him coach
2329057 i think the biggest question is who the tailbacks going to be but i think well be productive from that spot
2329058 its not like were not going to be able to move the ball now
2329059 there are a lot of different things we can do with this offense
2329060 we could see a lot more from the slots this year when the new tailback comes in hell be ready to go there are a lot of playmakers out there
2329061 in the recent past since we were good we havent played like a team
2329062 weve been playing like individuals this young group that we have they really seem to enjoy each others company
2329063 i dont think we have to make up for anything
2329064 sturges was a great player i dont think we can expect to have a guy of that quality to do it right away but we didnt expect him to be that way you just never know were going to find out which of our tailbacks that are in the program now and weve got a couple that are coming in a couple freshman that i think are going to be pretty good theyre going to compete like crazy for it we may end up with just one guy and we may end up with a couple guys and rotate series with them or something like that were still going to be productive offensively im confident of that
2329065 theres a lot of things you can do with a spread offense
2329066 we can run the ball throw the ball we have our slots slots are like running backs who can run routes so we can have them in the backfield or spread out as receivers we have a lot of things we can do well be able to make up the slack
2329067 the primary goal for the whole team is winning the centennial conference
2329068 and thats the top priority for our defense too to be the best defense in the centennial conference
2329069 it feels good coming back i feel more comfortable knowing ive got two years experience we lost a few guys last year but we have a lot of guys coming back with experience and some young guys i feel real confident coming into camp im ready to go
2329070 if youre away from the ball its always about pursuit
2329071 you can be that backside corner on that sweep away you just try and run and get there and collect thats been the biggest thing just never give up
2329072 we had a little bit of trouble tackling last year runs up the middle kind of killed us but thats what weve been working on
2329073 i think we have the potential to be better than we were better than weve been for a while at that spot
2329074 sophomore brian betley who played a little bit last year toward the end of the year hes a good sized kid hes a big kid thats also a kid that catches the ball real well he could potentially be one of the best guys weve had in a long time and we have two or three other guys that had really good springs
2329075 hes a big kid hes fast hes just a real good receiver
2329076 he has great hands runs good patterns i think hell have a real good season this year we have a couple other guys sophomore gavin jablonski hes been doing real good this spring
2329077 i mean with the whole poll thing it really doesnt matter to me
2329078 our coach over there its not really that big of a concern to us were going to come out working hard it doesnt matter if were one or nine in the poll were going to work just as hard
2329079 weve won some big games weve beaten some good people
2329080 we think weve matured as a team were beginning to understand what its going to take to win the whole thing it kind of goes along with it our offense has been more productive and our defense is coming up no question about that
2329081 by establishing a local presence in south africa we are making a commitment to expand our production and service capabilities in this growing market
2329082 the unit will also provide installation of wabtecs electronically controlled pneumatic braking equipment on locomotives and freight cars for transnet freight rail the state owned railway in south africa
2329083 we believe customers will benefit from faster response time and direct access to all of wabtecs products and services
2329084 if this can tie a bond if it can help disabled people to believe in themselves if it can bring them to a better understanding with able bodied people then thats great if it helps
2329085 after a week i started with the squad but in the first lane
2329086 it was not nice seeing little babies beat you so i just had to train harder get up with the guys get up with the seniors get back to the level i was swimming at before
2329087 theres really no line between able bodied and disabled swimming i treat both of them the same theyre your opponents and youve got to race the way you train
2329088 it is important to swim your own race and not someone elses

2329100 the players want resolution they want what everybody wants said coach mike mccarthy passing off he favre saga as a locker room issue when management prolonged the drama
2329101 to come out here every day and talk about somebody that is not here and then shows up its gone on too long and understandably so they want to play football
2329102 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
2329103 they wanted to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed favre told espn
2329104 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
2329105 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2329106 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2329107 we just felt like this was an opportunity to get somebody of bretts stature and what hes accomplished
2329108 we felt it was in the best interest of the team and when the opportunity presented itself we felt it was the right move for us to make and we went ahead and did it
2329109 they say that the black shows scratches but the white doesnt show scratches as much
2329110 why would you get white if you were a guy if i were a guy i would get black
2329111 if a guy got white what would you think of him
2329112 hes my boyfriend so i have to accept him either way but i think he has to get black
2329113 a ny attempt to identify a murderous ideology with a great faith such as islam is wrong and needs to be denied
2329114 the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
2329115 i believe we must assess a governing power not by what it says it is or by what it intends but by what it does
2329116 edwards is no longer an elected official and he is not running for office now dont expect wall to wall coverage
2329117 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that

2329126 my training has been going very well we are starting to do a lot more training on the course to prepare our bodies for the intense racing that is coming up
2329127 realistically there are six or seven girls who can all medal on the day and i include myself as one of these
2329128 after all these months its difficult to realise that we are days away from the opening ceremony
2329129 i can definitely feel the big race is coming up and the enormity of what we are about to experience is starting to feel real
2329130 there will probably be about a second separating us all so it is all about getting it right on the day at the right time
2329131 training has been going well and the k4 is hitting some super fast times
2329132 bridgitte hartley and i have been working hard to become much quicker off the mark

2329140 virtumonde has become a particularly difficult problem for vendors and users alike far more than our classification as adware or potentially unwanted application might suggest
2329141 it is consistently represented in our top ten scores despite the fact that its distributors keep changing virtumondes characteristics and delivery mechanism to hide it from us which suggests that were pretty successful at detecting it but if it does manage to install itself it can be very difficult to automate removal completely often requiring manual intervention
2329142 not surprisingly the bad guys concentrate a lot of r amp d effort on hiding from the most commercially successful anti virus products and all of the major anti malware scanners have difficulty detecting or removing at least some specimens of virtumonde unless their settings are so paranoid as to be almost unusable weve just made some alterations to our detection method that should put us ahead for a while but fighting virtumonde has become a war of attrition not a boxing match the arena changes the advantage swings from the bad guys to the good guys but there is no final knockout
2329143 as a security company we have to be trustworthy and ensure we provide the service we say were going to provide
2329144 if our clients didnt have confidence in our ability to protect their goods wed loose their business very quickly
2329145 they immediately impressed us with their attitude towards the project and with their knowledge of the technologies that would best help us meet our objectives
2329146 you need to be confident that the kit will work and we have great confidence in its reliability and in the quality of pictures it produces
2329147 we used norbain to supply all of the equipment for the project
2329148 our account manager is extremely helpful and is always available should we need any advice the next day delivery is also very reliable
2329149 the combination of both products offers ardene a modern efficient solution useful in todays national retail market installing and using axis network cameras properly is a very powerful added value to any large company we believe ardene chose the right product to do the job
2329150 because of our companys rapid growth rate we urgently needed to put a security system in place in our stores to reduce shrink
2329151 our primary reason for video surveillance is to make the potential shoplifter think twice before stealing in addition the surveillance system offers employees a sense of security knowing that if something were to happen in the store it would be caught on tape and proper action would be taken beyond loss prevention and security we plan to use the system for merchandising marketing staffing etc in fact we believe that most departments can benefit from our surveillance system

2329156 a complete replacement for petrol and diesel is not to be expected in the foreseeable future
2329157 the swiss are rich we can afford modern cars which are energy efficient but they are also bigger
2329158 we and the swedes are at the top of the european rankings
2329159 switzerland stands at around 170 grams but a reasonable target if we take sustainable development into account is at least 120
2329160 that amounts to about five litres of petrol for 100 kilometres
2329161 a binding target should be a two per cent per year petrol and diesel reduction instead of higher consumption
2329162 it is already possible today to heat buildings without oil or gas

2329168 we were desperate at that point so i put it all on my credit card i will never ever fly qantas again
2329169 i was livid they just didnt want us on the plane with the dogs it was pitiful
2329170 the passenger must carry and present a recognised service dog id card or documentation at the time of check in
2329171 in this case although qantas operated the flight the passengers travelled as customers of american airlines therefore american airlines has responsibility for booking ticketing and providing passengers with information
2329172 the audit carried out on the more than 390 000 signatures collected and handed in to parliament on 23rd june has given sufficient valid signatures to assure the referendum should proceed as planned
2329173 the government statistician now has until 23rd august to complete their final analysis of the results before the clerk of parliament delivers the verdict to the speaker of the house
2329174 based on the chief electoral officers audit i am very confident we will have succeeded it has been a huge task and i am relieved that this stage of our fight against this undemocratic and stupid law is now over
2329175 while 42 cir petitions have been started only three have been completed in the past 14 years confirmation of the referendum on the anti smacking law would be the fourth

2329181 i havent been practicing much lately because my legs have been week
2329182 on my last attempt at the record i placed my left hand a little higher on the pole and it worked for me
2329183 it was a great race but it was very hot
2329184 i wanted to go after that american record after the first mile i was off of american record pace so i thought id pick it up and see where i am after the second mile i put forth more effort but i didnt improve any so i knew the record wasnt going to happen today so i kind of relaxed and enjoyed the run because i have an 800m prelim to run today
2329185 woody kind of started us on he was big into running 5k and 10k races so he ran his first 10k when he was probably seven or eight years old
2329186 he really likes doing those and so that kind of got us running i was not a big runner i mean i would go out for a run every once in a while just to clear my head or get in shape a little bit but i would not do these running events but woody really liked doing them so anne started to run she had never been a runner she started to run and then i started to run a little bit more so we have done the ukrops monument avenue 10k i do not know four to five times we have done the ntelos 8k in the fall
2329187 a lot of people see those races first as spectators
2329188 they are fun they are fun to watch then an awful lot of people will say gosh i am going to run next year we use them in the office there is a little group usually around the ukrops monument avenue 10k there would be kind of an office challenge how many people are going to run it we get a lot of folks from the office to run it i have had a longstanding competition with my policy director where we have run it three times together and he beat me this year for the first time so we kind of have to have a competition going
2329189 this is the most exciting day ever in my life
2329190 its a great honor for me that my teammates chose to vote for me the opening ceremony is the best day and the best moment of olympic life im here as an ambassador of my country and i will do everything i can to represent my country well
2329191 the american flag means everything in my life everything that describes me coming from another country and going through all of the stages that i have to become a u s citizen

2329193 i want to run as fast as that guy and i want to run for that country
2329194 i went out to my tent to think about it

2329225 feedback from customers is very positive many informed us that the fundamentals covered in the morning session would help give them the confidence to pitch for ip projects
2329226 it was obvious from customer dialogue that more and more projects are becoming ip focused which is a real driving force for customers to expand their skills
2329227 the united states did not go to war in iraq solely because of wmd in my view i doubt it was even the principal cause yet it was the public face that was put on it
2329228 but i cannot respect a judging committee that decides to pick a book like child 44 by tom rob smith a fairly well written and well paced thriller over novels as exceptional as helen garners the spare room or ross raisins gods own country
2329229 this novel has been as well reviewed as any book canongate has ever published i received remarkable and heartfelt responses from a whole array of other novelists about the book pre publication including peter carey the spare room is a perfect novel hilary mantel john banville alberto manguel diana athill and michel faber any one of whom i would respect as a judge of serious fiction more than all five of these judges put together i am certain that the spare room is a modern classic that will continue to be read and enjoyed and appreciated long after all of us are dead

2329278 but i guess there is a balearic approach to what were trying to do im not a big crate digger but theres a certain aesthetic to the night that means tapping into a lot of different genres of music
2329279 a club brenda night during pride last year was amazing i also went to a yellow night where jon da silva who i really rate as a dj took over a space of his own
2329280 he was playing all sorts of amazing records that dated back to the early days pre house of the hacienda it was pretty inspirational both these parties took place in the intimate back room of the venue which is what im taking over tomorrow night
2329281 esg dinosaur l and other punk funk music were an integral part of the pre house music scene
2329282 music like that is what i want to throw into the mix tomorrow night i just want to put this night on occasionally and let people know that theres been a lot of thought put into it

2329289 urgent series of tests conducted at fort detrick maryland and elsewhere
2329290 so i asked how people should believe this given that theres no way to know where the information is coming from
2329291 his basic answer was that brian ross and abc news have reputations for being highly regarded journalistic outlets so we put our credibility behind the story and that should lead people to believe that this is credible
2329292 i dont know the answers to any of those questions
2329293 my main point is that we ought to know the answers to those questions and thats the only way we are going to know them through an investigation the striking fact about all this is that the anthrax attacker according to the government worked at the very same place the anonymous source came from which was fort detrick maybe it was a complete coincidence but it seems pretty significant to me that if a person from the same place where the perpetrator worked created a false story linking the attacks to something different its a very worthwhile reason for an investigation
2329294 i think first of all that this is a basic principal of journalism that if you get a story wrong you explain what happened that led to the bad reporting
2329295 thats what the new york times did to explain how they got those judy miller stories wrong when people get stories wrong the credibility of the journalistic outlet depends upon them explaining what happened if brian ross wants to say our sources acted in good faith they just got it wrong then he needs to explain the basis of that
2329296 at the very least abc should be working right now on some grand mea culpa along the lines of what the times did after the judith miller stories or even going back further to jayson blair
2329297 pretty much setting out not that we got this story wrong we know that but how we got it wrong what systemically allowed us to get this story so wrong and to flog it to the point that it was being used to embroil america in war i really think at the very least thats what they owe their viewers and themselves
2329298 now theres always a possibility that the sources were working in good faith that they were just supremely stupid or misinformed and got the story wrong
2329299 if thats the case it clouds the issue abc better be damn sure that these people were actually lying to them that they were specifically trying to mislead brian ross in the aims of furthering some sinister end before they can out them but i generally agree with the sentiment that investigative journalism is devoted to transparency and anonymity is a weapon for transparency it allows people with access to sensitive information to shield themselves from any backlash when a source uses that privilege of anonymity to push an agenda then i think a journalist is released from an obligation to protect that sources identity at all cost
2329300 its not a zero sum game where if i gave you bad information and therefore youre dead to me
2329301 i mean there can be a source that has given you five six seven things that have been reliable a trustworthy person youve gone to for info but if that person gives you bad intel one time does that negate everything else that that person gave you does that mean that they were acting maliciously here the trouble is that its very hard to prove intent its hard to show that youre being used
2329302 their initial conclusion based on microscopic examination was a brown substance that initially was reported as bentonite
2329303 we went back immediately after the white house told us it was not the case we were told after further chemical analysis it was determined it was a silica but not bentonite something they had never seen before but had a brownish color
2329304 if it was ivins i would report that in a second
2329305 was accurate at that point in their point of view
2329306 and if you can paraphrase his defense you are a better writer than i am

2329309 hes been putting pressure on all of us to nominate him and to me he shouldnt be doing that
2329310 i know a couple of comics that paid into a pension scheme but all the rest of us we were all thatchers children and we all just went what pay into a pension
2329311 now all of a sudden here we are 23 years later thinking s t
2329312 you can do it because you enjoy it but the bottom line is if you dont sell one of them hellip what else is going to pay for the pension my partner in the corner is pointing at her chest going me
2329313 i go on stage and get introduced as being from newcastle upon tyne and they always cheer because for some unknown reason we all like geordies then i walk on stage and theyre hold on its a scouser at which point they tend to go what the ells going on here

2329315 i grew up on a s y estate in liverpool and you were told you were thick
2329316 i didnt realise i was bright if that doesnt sound big headed
2329317 it was the eighties and because of the whole post riot stuff and the rise of militant nobody was ever going to employ a political analyst with a scouse accent
2329318 i never thought id be a stand up comic i was always shy and a bit of a loner when i was a kid i went to a school that didnt do plays so id never been on a stage
2329319 i was told i could earn 40 on christmas eve i was busking and breaking concrete slabs on my chest with a sledgehammer i was called the human anvil people would come in their throngs and stand clapping as the ambulance took me away

2329322 sometimes they might feel like they are the only ones like them but they are not many of the students will end up applying to rit ntid for college
2329323 the purpose of many of these activities including making a telescope and dissecting an eyeball is not only to see if the students are interested in a particular career field but also to get them to understand just how an eye works
2329324 sight is very important to a deaf or hard of hearing person and by showing students how a cows eye functions they can relate that information to their own physiology
2329325 it was very interesting to see the inside of an eyeball
2329326 you can really find activities that fit your personality and interests
2329327 when i first came to eyf i wanted to make friends i wanted to have fun
2329328 i wanted to pick up signs that i didnt know before

2329363 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2329364 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2329379 disney and wall e is great but theres also so many different types of films quite often you hear parents complain that they have had to sit through two hours of some inappropriate film for the sake of the kids but it doesnt need to be like that
2329380 we do screenings in places like museums libraries theatres art galleries and cinemas the idea is that families dont just sit there in front of a film but that theyre interacting as families and with the venue itself

2329419 of relief to policy makers the slackening labour market is taking steam out of wages
2329420 canadas housing market is entering a sustained downturn in our view
2329421 it does look like canadian houses finally got too expensive and builders too aggressive for the underlying demand environment
2329422 the takeoff in commodity prices since 2002 has driven an enormous improvement in canadas terms of trade accounting for much of the strong growth in canadian national income that has in turn provided the fundamental underpinning for the housing market boom
2329423 if households are uncertain about the duration of an improvement in the terms of trade then house prices will abruptly drop when the terms of trade stop improving

2329427 toronto on the other hand has 1989 to consider and their prices have not run up too too much for that reason i would give them the 15 drop their market might be save by people who want to move closer to the core because of the cost of gas

2329439 a nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious but it cannot survive treason from within an enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is known and carries his banner openly but the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys heard in the very halls of government itself for the traitor appears not a traitor he speaks in accents familiar to his victims and he wears their face and their arguments he appeals to the baseness that lies in the heart of all men he rots the soul of a nation he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist a murder is less to fear the traitor is the plague

2329522 should the european union allow only self extinguishing cigarettes it is quite possible that switzerland will follow suit
2329523 burning cigarettes are the leading cause of home fire fatalities every year burning cigarettes are also responsible for many forest fires
2329524 fire safer cigarettes would save hundreds of lives every year and reduce the number of fire incidents
2329525 this fire prevention measure is therefore in the interests of the health authorities and fire prevention organisations
2329526 such a measure is possible but switzerland would have to adapt the law on tobacco products
2329527 consumers should understand that those changes do not make cigarettes fire safe or even necessarily fire safer anything that burns if handled carelessly can cause a fire including cigarettes manufactured to meet the new york standards

2329555 i knew this week was key to the ryder cup
2329556 there are two days to go but the key for me to play good golf is to not get ahead of myself and think about ryder cup
2329557 today i was really in the moment playing one shot at a time and thats clearly my goal for the weekend a good performance here really helps out with the ryder cup
2329558 he always had this little mischievous grin on him and a little twinkle in his eyes that always made you wonder what he was up to
2329559 he was a very curious energetic young man he was very athletic and i would say that he was a little more of a risk taker especially on the playground
2329560 he looked like an athlete even at that age he didnt have to do any extra laps for shenanigans
2329561 he stood out as a kid that had a lot of potential
2329562 i felt it was creating or could give the perception of some type of bias
2329563 i dont want to see us having to pay legal fees because one of our committee members may have acted inappropriately
2329564 it wasnt what he said at the planning board meeting it was the action he took that caused it
2329565 that is the person who represents the people of chili
2329566 if he gives me and order to recuse myself how can i disobey in good conscious that office belongs to the people of chili thats the oval office as far as im concerned
2329567 is there anyone who you would say were musical heroes to you at the time
2329568 if i had one it would have to be stevie wonder when i was just at that point where you start getting involved in music stevie had that run with music of my mind talking book fulfillingness first finale and innervisions and then songs in the key of life those are as brilliant a set of five albums as weve ever seen
2329569 as an african american im frankly insulted that the obama campaign would imply that we are so stupid that we would think bill and hillary clinton who have been deeply and emotionally involved in black issues when barack obama was doing something in the neighborhood that i wont say what he was doing but he said it in his book

2329574 i ordered destruction of all chemical weapons all weapons biological chemical missile nuclear were destroyed you have important role in iraq with this you should not underestimate yourself you are very effective in iraq
2329575 the accumulated effect of the work that has been accomplished over six years since the ceasefire went into effect between iraq and the coalition is such that not much is unknown about iraqs retained proscribed weapons capabilities
2329576 every major designer shop in geneva has one member of staff who speaks russian and when i walk along the rue du rh ne the main shopping street i very often hear people speaking my language
2329577 the number of russian visitors is increasing dramatically at a similar rate to tourists from the gulf states india and china
2329578 they are a mixed group of clients who choose geneva and switzerland for business and leisure they want top class destinations
2329579 apart from the peace and quiet far from their busy lives in moscow and the beauty of the swiss tourist sites the russians like being able to tour switzerland in less than two weeks
2329580 there are not enough five star hotels in certain tourist regions like verbier the verbier classical music festival in which numerous russian musicians participate could appeal to many more russian music fans
2329581 and the welcome here is not always up to what you can expect in certain parts of asia for example in this respect switzerland is losing its reputation
2329582 the russian consulate in geneva has registered some 2 000 people but many more live in the region
2329583 over the past three to four years we have witnessed a renewed presence of russians in switzerland after a quiet period between 1998 and 2005
2329584 today the situation has turned around britain is becoming less popular with the russians and switzerland is once again in their good books
2329585 and a large share of russias oil is traded in geneva
2329586 the russian economy is poised to attain western standards today it offers some fantastic investor opportunities

2329589 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was
2329590 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
2329591 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity

2329593 winter winds and swirling snow failed to dampen the enthusiasm that greeted the inaugural miniature golf championship held at the southworth library on dartmouth street on sunday afternoon we were a bit worried when we saw the snow but we had a great turnout in spite of the weather said dolly sharek treasurer of the library foundation we had 274 golfers sign up and we raised just over 10 000 as attendance reached its peak at around 2 p m all of the 100 putters borrowed for the occasion were in use on the 18 hole course that wound its way around the stacks on both floors and a line had formed at the registration table golfers of all ages were challenged by the unique aspect of the library course which explored all corners of the building with a 10th hole that teed off on the second floor and finished on the first some of those taking on the newly installed circuit were evidently more practiced than others the seventh hole brought library trustee paul pereira to his knees and it was not to line up a putt he was trying to retrieve his ball from beneath one of the stacks
2329594 what they had the course in the library d amp i would have loved to be there how do they do the holes
2329595 i made a couple of mistakes the guy started to feel much more comfortable on the court and the momentum was gone
2329596 i didnt serve very well in the third set and the balls are pretty slow so it was difficult for my game i could not change it by serving and volleying it was perfect for him because he was playing very simple tennis
2329597 robinho is very angry about the way he has been treated by the directors of real madrid
2329598 he calls me every day to see if anyone has said anything about his future and i have to tell him no one will speak to me
2329599 ive spent three days trying to contact them and they seem to have disappeared
2329600 robinho cant understand it he could become the best player in the world but it isnt going to happen at real because they treat him like a second rate player
2329601 robinhos plan was always to play at real for many years before retiring with santos his former club in brazil but now he doesnt feel wanted
2329602 he has explained himself perfectly from my perspective and the matter is closed
2329603 he is a manchester united player hes happy to be a manchester united player and hes always been happy here its just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life that has made it difficult for him
2329604 the important thing is that we have ended all this stuff about real madrid and he will as he gets older appreciate being here more and more because that happens with players the longer they stay here they never want to leave

2329623 there was a bustling black market for forged documents in baghdad after the war how will we determine which documents are real and which documents are not
2329624 does not have enough competent arabic linguists to sift through and screen all the material
2329625 theres no quality control youll have guys out there with a smattering of arabic drawing all kinds of crazy conclusions
2329626 the simple fact is that lots of people particularly in the middle east pass along many rumors and they end up being recorded and filed by us intelligence agencies in raw reports
2329627 iraq did provide other kinds of sponsorship to terrorist groups some of the palestinian groups that arent so active anymore but in terms of it having provided support or sustenance or strength or having anything close to an alliance with al qaeda it simply wasnt there
2329628 the land of the arab world the land is like a mother and saddam hussein is fucking his mother
2329629 colonel muammar qadhafis decades long confrontation with the west has never given him much purchase among militant islamists in libya
2329630 proves that not only saddam regime supported terrorists organization like hamas and al qaeda as we have learned from other documents but also they were recruiting suicide terrorist bombers to hit us interests
2329631 the leaflets and the radio broadcasts are to try to get if there is conflict to keep the worst case from happening apparently they are having some effect because we understand the iraqi regime tells the populace that the leaflets are coated with chemicals and are actually out there picking them up with chemical suits on
2329632 now tremble as you prepare to be crushed under my awesome logic and reasoning capacity i will destroy you aaaarrrrgggghhhh
2329633 proof will turn up one day just you wait and see
2329634 the iraqi documents a glimpse into the regime of saddam hussein
2329635 well what was found and this has been the pretty consistent story all along with regard to intelligence coverage of that topic is there were various data points that were relevant to that issue even some encounters or meetings held years ago in sudan other kinds of coincidences or two different names appearing in the same place what it all added up to in the view of the judgment in the judgment of the intelligence analysts working those particular issues was that you had two entities one the saddam regime and the other al qaeda that were kind of feeling each other out trying to stay aware of what they were doing what each other was doing but no indication of anything that could be described as a patron client relationship or a sponsor client relationship or an alliance there were some of these coincidences and contacts but thats hardly anything out of the ordinary and not something that adds up to state sponsorship
2329636 the main thing that happened there particularly with reference to this issue of was there a relationship between the saddam regime and al qaida was a selective use of bits and pieces of reporting to try to build the case that in this case there was some kind of alliance without really reflecting the analytic judgment of the intelligence community that there was not
2329637 he condemned saddam hussein in my interview he gave such kind of abuses that it was very difficult for me to write calling hussein a socialist motherfucker he also explained that saddam hussein is against us and he discourages iraqi boys to come to afghanistan

2329639 izsp 2003 00003336 was principally misinterpreted by james ray robison a former army officer from alabama
2329640 despite the obvious robison maintains that the anthrax plot was real
2329641 update in the comments section a reader told me that the translation provided by the fmso was incorrect
2329642 it seems ray has been rebuked by his seniors more than once for getting ideas way above his station
2329643 it was a common occurrence to speak with other employees at the facility who had reviewed materials that we considered material to the question of whether the saddam regime had wmds and links to terrorism many times when we reviewed the information with intelligence professionals on site we were rebuked as not being intelligence specialists despite the fact that many of us had extensive operational military backgrounds like me as a gulf war and kosovo vet and former field artillery officer
2329644 izsp 2003 00003336 was principally misinterpreted by james ray robison
2329645 despite the obvious robison maintains that the anthrax plot was real
2329646 definite proof then that saddam was in contact with bin ladens group and looking for iraqi volunteers to strike american interests er not exactly al qadisya alternate spellings qadisiya qadisiyah qadisiyya kadisiya is actually the name of an iraqi province a number of state establishments were once located there including a large military base so not quite the result joseph shahda was scrounging for
2329647 despite the obvious robison maintains that the anthrax plot was real

2329649 now that we can actually see a virus being born it gives us the opportunity to answer previously unanswered questions not only in virology but in biology in general

2329689 but he really misfired when he violated his bond agreement and crossed the border into canada last month without telling the court in advance the behavior that got him into this legal quagmire suggests that kilpatrick considers himself above the law
2329690 new yorks mayor is lucky hes not facing charges for that vigilante gun shop sting operation he mounted two years ago because it interfered with legitimate federal investigations did kilpatrick think that he would also avoid trouble even though he lied under oath about a relationship he had with his former chief of staff
2329691 is hardly the face id want representing any group of mayors if i were michael bloomberg

2329739 lokis castle provides potential answers to questions like the reactions between rocks sediments and fluids at ultraslow spreading ridges and the evolution of the ecosystem hopefully giving clues about the origins of life
2329740 we hadnt expected a lot of active venting on ultra slow spreading ridges
2329741 preliminary observations suggest that the ecosystem around these arctic vents is different from vent communities found elsewhere
2329742 the hot and anaerobic environment and the fluid chemistry of present day hydrothermal systems is likely to be similar to the environments where early life could have evolved but how these ecosystems form is not yet fully understood

2329749 the question to my mind is whether or not we ought to get them the heck out of that country because thats some crazy stuff when youve got your officials talking like they are in a back alley brawl and not government officials who took an oath to obey the law and so forth
2329750 were not going to allow these people to compound the tragedy of the mclean family loss and canadians simply wont tolerate these lunatics disrupting what should be a respectful service
2329751 your freedom to swing your arm in the air ends when it touches the end of my nose

2329759 de cultuur hier is fantastisch er werken geweldige mensen bij probuild en landsmeer zelf l ft voor het basketbal met name dat van de vrouwen de tribunes zitten elke wedstrijd vol met trouwe supporters
2329760 het zijn vriendelijke meiden alleen ontbreekt het hen aan mentale kracht om voor probuild cht effectief te zijn
2329761 met marie hebben we een toekomstige topspeelster in huis gehaald
2329762 ze heeft verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel is leergierig en vooral mentaal erg sterk
2329763 molly is een total package als basketbalspeelster ik heb in europa weinig speelsters gezien die allround z goed zijn als molly daarnaast is het een echte harde werkster het type speelster waar ik graag mee werk
2329764 met probuild wil ik alle prijzen in de wacht slepen dit jaar al d t is waar we voor gaan
2329765 en dat zeg ik niet uit hoogmoed een club als probuild is het aan haar stand verplicht met minder geen genoegen te nemen met de huidige selectie zijn de mogelijkheden er absoluut als we uitgaan van onze eigen kracht kunnen we elke tegenstander in deze competitie aan
2329766 keith gaf daar in de eerste wedstrijd meteen zijn visitekaartje af een dag na de wedstrijd werden we al door onze contactpersoon in de
2329767 hij is overal z gedreven is hij scoren rebounden en vooral keihard verdedigen keith wordt getypeerd als een bevlogen speler die laat zien dat hij ambitie heeft evengoed werd hij door ons nog even in de wacht gezet vanwege zijn statistieken die leken in eerste instantie niet overtuigend genoeg
2329768 zijn prestatie in las vegas toon het aan keith is zonder meer een underrated speler de cijfers die hij op college noteerde produceerde hij in ongeveer 25 minuten geef hem meer speeltijd en hij heeft dezelfde statistieken als lawrence hamm op towson university neerzette
2329769 keith kan heus schieten maar daarvoor komt hij niet naar leeuwarden pete zoekt in de eerste plaats naar verdedigende intensiteit hij houdt van spelers die zich iedere week uit de naad werken onlangs zei hij tegen mij let maar eens op wat we verdedigend gaan laten zien dit seizoen aan de andere kant heeft pete aangegeven dat hij het als zijn taak ziet keith naar de positie van small forward te brengen hij heeft zeker de beweeglijkheid die daarvoor nodig is en die we het afgelopen seizoen zo misten

2329773 all professions worthy of the name have the concept of malpractice not due to intent but due to inability it can be caused by lack of aptitude substance abuse ignorance which is willful etc we dont have a good word at least in english for malpractice in citizenship the closest we can come is as john mccain said recently that he was not questioning barack obamas patriotism but his judgment and competence i have no doubt that by todays standard even benedict arnold would be defended as simply expressing a dissenting opinion we really need a word meaning mal citizenship somewhat paraphrasing the late sir arthur c clarke sufficient partisanship or willful ignorance is functionally indistinguishable from treason
2329774 barack obama will require you to work he is going to demand that you shed your cynicism that you put down your divisions that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zones that you push yourselves to be better and that you engage barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed

2329776 el polisario tiene la legalidad internacional de su lado ahora bien el consejo de seguridad no est dispuesto a ejercer sus poderes en funci n del cap tulo vii de la carta de la onu y a imponerla
2329777 tenemos por un lado al tribunal internacional de justicia que en 1975 se al que el conflicto del s hara occidental es una cuesti n de descolonizaci n que debe ser resuelta mediante un refer ndum y por otro al consejo de seguridad que ostenta el poder de organizar ese refer ndum pero no lo hace porque reh sa imponer una soluci n
2329778 debe respetar la legalidad internacional pero tambi n tener en cuenta la realidad pol tica sobre el terreno
2329779 treinta a os de argumentos legales de peso del polisario no produjeron resultado alguno
2329780 es moralmente satisfactorio brindar un apoyo incondicional a los que est n en su derecho pero debe tenerse en cuenta el riesgo de crear falsas esperanzas y prolongar la agon a
2329781 a aquellos espa oles que se preocupan de coraz n por el bienestar de los saharauis les aconsejo que se pregunten si act an correctamente animando al polisario a apostar a toda costa por la plena independencia
2329782 bas ndose en la historia del conflicto no creo que incite as al consejo de seguridad a imponer una soluci n
2329783 creo que la violencia no desembocar a en un s hara independiente
2329784 marruecos debe asumir la culpa de que el refer ndum sea irrealizable
2329785 si el polisario comunica formalmente al secretario general que est dispuesto a participar en una quinta ronda aunque no si van walsum asiste a ella dif cilmente me imagino a m mismo presidiendo la nueva sesi n de manhasset
2329786 ahora bien no voy a dimitir a causa de las declaraciones de la direcci n del polisario a los medios de comunicaci n
2329787 las cuatro primeras rondas fueron est riles confiaba en que la quinta nos brindar a la oportunidad de debatir sobre mi opini n el empe o del polisario en la plena independencia ahonda el bloqueo y perpet a el statu quo
2329788 lamento que haya sacado la conclusi n de que he tomado partido por marruecos
2329789 lo que dije en abril ante el consejo de seguridad no es diferente de la conclusi n que ya saqu tras mis primeras consultas en enero de 2006 la independencia del s hara occidental no es un objetivo alcanzable
2329790 estaban en profundo desacuerdo conmigo pero segu amos discutiendo incluso dir a yo de manera amistosa
2329791 no estoy dispuesto a desaparecer del escenario como el enviado personal que ha violado su mandato inclin ndose por una de las partes
2329792 no consiste en establecer cu l de las partes tiene mejores argumentos sino en explorar con ellas cu l es la mejor manera de superar el impasse
2329793 las reticencias de marruecos pueden estar relacionadas con la sensaci n de que de esa consulta emanar a una mayor a favorable a la independencia
2329794 marruecos debe asumir la total responsabilidad de que el refer ndum sea irrealista e irrealizable

2329819 non c dubbio che dobbiamo puntare a questo risultato avverte ma dato che si tratta di un obiettivo molto ambizioso e non sappiamo nel dettaglio in che modo raggiungerlo dovremmo essere pronti ad adattarci a quattro gradi in pi
2329820 anche se riusciamo a mettere insieme il miglior accordo possibile per ridurre i gas serra dichiara al guardian da un punto di vista razionale dobbiamo comunque prepararci a un 20 per cento di eventualit di rischio e quindi penso che watson abbia ragione quando indica il dato dei 4 gradi non c da scegliere tra mitigazione e adattamento bisogna perseguire entrambi

2329843 both mothers and fathers are tired of being unfairly vilified pursued and stereotyped when it comes to financial child support they say it doesnt help their children or families when the main breadwinner is devastated humiliated threatened or constantly pursued by a misguided and ill informed system unfair illogical harsh punitive measures against alleged nonpayers such as lifting drivers and professional licenses and jail are not helping children and families

2329870 professional to professional you have some major design flaws in your invention 1 theres too much inconsistency in the front end suspension 2 it chatters constantly at high speeds 3 most rear ends are too soft and wobble about too much 4 the intake is placed way too close to the exhaust 5 the maintenance costs are outrageous
2329871 well it may be true that my invention is flawed
2329872 but according to these numbers more men are riding my invention than yours
2329873 thats because you have had your product out for a longer period of time you have created a monopoly though now admittedly a very small fraction of men are trying out other options and finally your product has no resale value infact it costs more to get rid of than to acquire it
2329874 this happened in english in norwegian in japanese and serbian
2329875 now when the book is released in hard copy the sales are spectacular
2329876 i think your language for your blog is totally different from your language in the guardian right so we have to adapt ourselves i have a lot of fun doing this
2329877 have you seen any data integrity issues with your disk drives during bizarre scsi scenarios
2329878 the airline problems are not going to prevent us from going forward
2329879 chicagos claim they can fund this stuff without the airlines wont hold water on analysis
2329880 you have to constrict a whole lot to get to the point where that extra runway wont be used
2329881 they dont want to pay for anything extra they dont need
2329882 he knew there was a bidding he knew that they packers had a higher offer from the jets and he knew that the packers wanted him to go to the jets
2329883 he and his agent were continually working im sure all night talking on and off with the different teams
2329884 he was aware of both teams but the comment was made that he wasnt as interested in the jets
2329885 evolve into something much bigger and better to support our community of players creators and sharers
2329886 number one first of all he has to realize that the cowboys was such an intrical part of my career
2329887 done in a day faux finish rustic faux painted plaster walls
2329888 because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there
2329889 im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
2329890 he loves it since he was 6 he could tie his own line put his own hook on and take the fish off
2329891 i set up the posts and practice for 30 minutes twice a day i practice the first one the flip for five minutes then second one for 10 and last one for 15
2329892 winning the state was my favorite part of the casting kids
2329893 i won a medal a fishing pole and a target
2329894 it appears that its a trend of b amp es breaking and entering
2329895 it moved from us to beavercreek and now jamestown all indications are its the same people its the same mo
2329896 theres mold growing in the channels and this sign is no older than six years old ive got several thousand dollars invested in that but it just could not take the weather its a pretty regular maintenance issue
2329897 we are the welcome to the city at the west entrance i think it would dress up the property by having something thats easier to read going by there now you can have a neck bender trying to figure out what were trying to sell
2329898 dresser rand and arrow industries have worked together in the past and each has decades of experience providing innovative solutions in the energy markets
2329899 both companies are known for quality economy and reliability that bring added value to their clients the acquisition of arrow industries strengthens business and will enhance our ability to better serve the pipeline industry and other markets
2329900 this is not only a great occasion for arrow but also a great opportunity to expand current capabilities and provide clients with the benefits that a small company can offer backed by the resources and solutions of a leading oem
2329901 enginuity will strengthen engine technology position and value proposition in the gas transmission market and enhance applied technology capabilities
2329902 together dresser rand and enginuity expect to play a leading role in the development and deployment of technology solutions to reduce co2 emissions from compressor systems
2329903 when combined with highly engineered products and global sales and service capabilities this brand provides the platform by which enginuity can realize its vision of bringing energy and the environment into harmony
2329904 i see the olympics and the opening ceremonies as a chance to symbolize an important transformation in chinas self image
2329905 for most of the 20th century china viewed itself as a weak and vulnerable country that has been denied its historical place in the sun
2329906 it was bullied by foreign powers and it drew upon the legalist tradition to ruthlessly strengthen the state and mobilize the people for that purpose now that its more powerful and has begun to re establish its deserved place in the sun it can relax a bit and the traditional confucian ways of soft power can begin to reassert themselves
2329907 it is not entirely fanciful to surmise that the chinese communist party will be relabelled the chinese confucian party in the next couple of decades
2329908 its good to take a break from my hard work and it means that i can spend my time watching the olympics on television
2329909 some of my relatives died a few years ago and i really wish they could have lived to see this
2329910 four of my family members have come to beijing for the olympics
2329911 today we spent two hours on a bus to see the birds nest and the water cube theyre wonderful i think every chinese should be patriotic about this i feel very excited about it
2329912 if china can pull off the first truly civil olympics where spectators cheer for opposing teams where winning athletes go out of their way to treat losers with respect and dignity and where ordinary beijingers treat foreigners with kindness and civility it will be a memorable olympics something that chinese should feel proud of
2329913 everybody is trying to provide a platform for political exchange cultural exchange
2329914 but we also need a philosophical platform so recently in all my music im interested in trying to find not just the phenomenon of harmonics like water meets fire but an internal basic chinese philosophy
2329915 among all chinese philosophy zen is the most predesigned by the gods for the future
2329916 zen can be the philosophical guide for all people to share in the 21st century i want to pass this zen experience on
2329917 sports music has a specific way to handle speed key changes mode it is very intense
2329918 we had to analyze normal peoples walking speed and sportsmens walking speed and average it we had to find a middle way for the tempo to have the most comfortable pacing for everyone
2329919 in the beginning you are a sports lover and a music lover then you put them together
2329920 now i find that it is quite interesting to see both as one its big fun
2329921 be a key which lets people open the door to china
2329922 then one day i was in beijing and the winner of the olympic gold medal design was announced it was gold and jade together so i started researching this in the chinese encyclopedia
2329923 it is the very high stage of taoism it expresses the highest state of harmony so i decided i wanted to use gold and jade materials to make my music
2329924 so now the gold and jade ensemble serves as the basic ceremonial colors mixed with the china philharmonic symphony and chorus
2329925 we took very very ancient culture and very very modern culture and they will meet at the olympics
2329926 i think its a wonderful choice because of its philosophical base water and fire and its east and west musical culture
2329927 the zen idea which tells you to share and to understand things from a different angle without requiring you to unite
2329928 are making noble attempts to preserve their natural assets create a user friendly infrastructure and build an economy where their citizens share the benefits of tourist revenue by bringing our commerce to such places we encourage their efforts and inspire neighboring countries to support these values as well
2329929 i assume you will be going with a prius or some other hybrid
2329930 these new exploration licenses acquire acreage with highly attractive exploration potential it enables us to proceed with our plans for further growth in pakistan where omv is currently the biggest international gas producer
2329931 the situation is very grave there is no question about that
2329932 its just to avoid even the appearance of any impropriety
2329933 it was better for everyone to have him in a different facility
2329934 usually takes between five and ten seconds to induce unconsciousness
2329935 its a quality of life issue officers are trying to provide for their families
2329936 we are proud to be selected as maker of the on vessel mooring equipment for the first production unit of octabuoy design to be built this contract underlines aker solutions strong position for mooring systems to installations in harsh environments such as the north sea
2329937 the operation is important as it consolidates petrobras position in the south american market we had little participation in chile a country where the economy is stable with this deal petrobras now holds significant assets there
2329938 the intention is as of this first deal to discover new opportunities in the country
2329939 oh you can take my picture hand on hip but you have to buy me the hat
2329940 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2329941 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2329942 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2329943 in a study published in the may 1 2008 biochemical pharmacology journal researchers report having previously shown that dim is able to stop tumors from establishing their own blood supply angiogenesis in cultured endothelial cells in rodents in this study they demonstrated that dim reduces the level of hypoxia inducible factor hif 1alpha in hypoxic tumor cell lines as well as hif 1 transcriptional activity moreover the level of oxygen in tumor cells was increased this study is the first to show that dim can decrease the accumulation and activity of the key angiogenesis regulatory factor hif 1alpha in hypoxic tumor cells the april 22 2008 pharmaceutical research reports that prostrate apoptosis response 4 par 4 is a unique pro apoptotic protein that selectively induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells apoptosis is the planned appropriate death of cells without which cells may exhibit excess proliferation researchers sought to identify the functional significance of par 4 in pancreatic cancer results revealed that low doses of the b dim the most bioavailable formulation of dim induced par 4 in pancreatic cancer cells dim reduced cancer cell viability and caused cell growth inhibition and apoptosis the cancer letter march 28 2008 reports that the interaction between the chemokine receptor and its unique ligand is known to mediate the progression and metastasis of breast prostate and other cancers organs to which these cancers metastasize secrete the particular ligand which binds to the chemokine receptor on the surface of primary cancer cells this process subsequently stimulates the invasive properties of the cancer cells and attracts them to the preferred organ sites of metastases the researchers found that dim down regulates both the ligand and the receptor in breast cancer cells as well as in ovarian cancer cells at the transcriptional level and in an estrogen independent manner they demonstrated that the potential of cells for chemotaxis and invasion is inhibited by dim furthermore they showed that dim down regulates the chemokine receptor under hypoxia and the ligand under estradiol inducing conditions the data suggest that one mechanism whereby dim protects against breast ovarian and possibly other cancers is through the repression of this mechanism thereby lowering the invasive and metastatic potential of these cells from the march 15 2008 cancer research comes a study reporting that platelet derived growth factor d pdgf d is a newly recognized growth factor known to regulate many cellular processes including cell proliferation transformation invasion and angiogenesis recent studies have shown that pdgf d and its receptor are expressed in prostate tumor tissues suggesting that pdgf d plays an important role in the development and progression of prostate cancer researchers found that pdgf d was significantly inhibited by b dim this correlated with decreased cell proliferation and invasion b dim also inhibited the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells they concluded that b dim could serve as an efficient preventative and or therapeutic agent in prostate cancer molecular cancer therapeutics february 2008 reports a study of human breast cancer cell lines to understand the mechanisms of dim in vitro experiments were done with breast cancer cell lines researchers found that dim inhibited the growth of all four breast cancer cell lines because two of the cell lines over expressed her 2 and two of the lines lacked estrogen receptors these were studied further in both cell lines dim appeared to induce expression of p27 protein before the loss of cell viability and apoptosis dim induced p27 transcript expression within 6 hours dim also induced nuclear localization of p27 in both cell lines in one of the cell lines dim induced a decrease in phosphorylation researchers concluded that dim modulates p27 through transcription prolongation of protein half life and nuclear localization these effects appear to be independent of her 2 or estrogen receptor status the january 2008 journal of nutrition finds that because recurrent or chronic inflammation has been implicated in the development of a variety of human cancers researchers examined the anti inflammatory effects of dim and the underlying mechanisms using lipopolysaccharides lps stimulated macrophages dim significantly decreased the release of nitric oxide prostaglandin e2 tumor necrosis factor alpha interleukin 6 and il 1beta cells treated with lps dim inhibited lps induced increases in protein levels of inducible no synthase the messenger rna levels of phospholipase a2 decreased whereas neither cox 2 protein nor transcript was altered researchers concluded that dim inhibits lps induced release of pro inflammatory mediators in macrophages
2329944 if these boats go out most go as far as navy pier thats it unless they have a sail
2329945 its pretty typical many of our boaters have jet skis or dinghies they keep with their bigger boats even though gas is expensive boaters are finding ways to make the best of it
2329946 they come down and use their boats kind of like a summer cottage
2329947 im just bumping along hoping next year might be different
2329948 they ignore the facts so that they can continue doing what they want to do which is enrich themselves and spend our money on trying to have all these shrines erected in our city so when they die they can have something to be remembered by all at a high cost to us
2329949 the perfect storm of inequity and anger among the poor people in our community thats why we are seeing so much violence
2329950 zouden ze dat kleintje nu echt een t shirt met vlekken aandoen

2329959 america is is no longer uh what it could be what it it once was
2329960 and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
2329961 we know about mr speers nazi family but dont see its relevance to what is happening in beijing
2329962 the beijing olympics should be a moment to bring citizens around the world together but the chinese government still hasnt opened meaningful dialogue on tibet or made progress on burma and darfur and global activists messages are too often lost in a firestorm of accusations about being anti chinese weve decided to take the moment back with a powerful unambiguous message of peace friendship and dialogue the olympic handshake the handshake began with the dalai lama passing through the streets of london now its gone online where all of us can join in help the handshake travel toward beijing where our message will be delivered through a big olympic media campaign before the closing ceremonies join the handshake and see yourself and others as it goes around the globe

2329973 some guys have cried when i beat them a couple of guys have quit
2329974 some guys wont wrestle me because they dont want to lose to a girl
2329975 it was a good feeling to finish that high and get all american again considering how little training i could do
2329976 if i hadnt been hurt and had been able to train more i think i could have finished in the top four
2329977 it was power puff game may 7 between the juniors and seniors
2329978 it was muddy and raining i went to tackle a girl we slipped went into a bench on the sideline and i dislocated my shoulder
2329979 i popped it back in on the sidelines and kept playing even though it hurt i didnt play the second half because i had to do to our national honor society induction
2329980 the big difference between me and some of the other girls at nationals was upper body strength and experience
2329981 they wrestle freestyle at nationals the only wrestling i do most of the time is the high school style
2329982 i adapt pretty quickly to freestyle but the girls who do it all the time are tough theyre really strong
2329983 shes a hard nosed kid with an unbelievable work ethic
2329984 it might have been a little bit of an issue a couple of years ago having a girl wrestle at the high school level but now shes got the respect of everybody in the program shes a very good wrestler and getting better technically as she gets better in competition
2329985 id like to go into mechanical engineering but a lot of the schools that have womens wrestling dont have engineering schools

2329987 as of right now there are no five star courses in ohio
2329988 this places beavercreek golf club in the top 5 percent of public courses in the state of ohio
2329989 im extremely proud to be a four star and well see if we can get to five and be the first in the state

2329994 obama is not only exempt from satire in cartoons he can also get away with sending his own children to private schools while opposing giving vouchers to poor parents to permit them to choose their childrens schools in effect he thinks choice should be the privilege of the rich and the poor should accept their fate
2329995 this proposed rule is nothing but a solution in search of a problem
2329996 the changes would invite excessive and abusive lawsuits against public companies and hurt u s global competitiveness
2329997 if theres one thing we dont need more of its abusive lawsuits
2329998 adopting these proposals would add uncertainty complexity new liability and a great deal of cost while compelling companies to provide potentially unreliable immaterial and privileged information about pending litigation
