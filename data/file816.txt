8160003 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8160004 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8160005 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8160022 nel corso degli ultimi tre anni spiega la ricerca con riferimento a un paniere di prodotti orticoli costruito in modo omogeneo la differenza tra il prezzo alla produzione e quello allingrosso risulta in italia superiore al 100 contro un valore mediamente del 60 in spagna e in francia
8160023 in questa fase per litalia si legge nello studio utilizzando i dati dellistituto di servizi per il mercato agricolo alimentare ismea si osserva un incremento medio di prezzo superiore al 50 nel complesso dal produttore al consumatore il ricarico totale del comparto e mediamente del 200
8160024 nel caso di filiere cortissime passaggio diretto dal produttore al venditore
8160025 prossimo al 300 nei casi in cui siano presenti 3 o 4 intermediari oltre al produttore e al distributore finale
8160026 a causa dellelevata stagionalit e deperibilit dei prodotti o a fronte di una scarsa organizzazione della produzione agricola
8160027 rappresentata in circa il 60 dei casi da un solo intermediario coincidente di norma con il mercato allingrosso
8160028 si caratterizza ancora per la presenza di una moltitudine di strutture di piccola dimensione a fronte dei 19 mercati allingrosso esistenti in francia e dei 23 in spagna in italia sono presenti quasi 150 strutture
8160029 una dimensione pari a meno di un quinto di quella delle realt minori in francia e spagna
8160030 poco meno della met delle strutture italiane risale agli anni sessanta e settanta e quasi un terzo e antecedente alla seconda guerra mondiale
8160031 il complesso dei mercati allingrosso si presenta insufficiente a trattare unofferta agricola rilevante ridistribuendola verso altri mercati di sbocco

8160098 i think well be able to strengthen legislation and apply bandaid solutions to give us breathing space but ultimately if you want to preserve koalas and everything we value such as less crowded beaches and roads then the population has to be stabilised
8160099 i am concerned that the state government is trying to manipulate the national strategy by being seen to be doing something about the dire state of koalas in queensland
8160100 ive read 700 post mortems of urban koalas and i can tell you a lot of these koalas are simply starving to death
8160101 the declaration overnight by russian president dmitry medvedev i dont believe is a helpful contribution indeed some may regard that as provocative

8160110 hi gary amp merri you two are the best your seminar was fantastic i am so excited i had procrastinated fulfilling my continuing education for my brokers license and then just before my surgeries i realized my expiration date isnt nov 12th it is sept 12th well as you can see prior to taking your course i had only completed 3 units of the required 45 units i thought i would take your course and then complete my remaining 42 units over the next 2 weeks however i took one class exam on saturday night august 27th i didnt even take the cellophane off the required course manuals until after i saw the two of you today less than 5 hours ago i used your techniques and completed 39 units of continuing education today i have now completed all 45 units all of my test scores were in the 90 6 96 range my course exam information is listed below i just wanted to let you know how valuable your course was to me thanks again
8160111 once we felt each others power and we hit each other it just became mayhem
8160112 the only thing i thought was they were trying to give kawajiri time to get his breath back
8160113 it was part of my gameplan going in hes 30 years old im 24 my conditioning compared to most of the fighters out there thats where i win fights
8160114 im able to attack and keep coming thats a big advantage of mine and they were taking that away from me by giving him his breath back
8160115 i kept arguing with the referee while i was in the corner saying im okay im okay let me back out
8160116 i dont know if that was more about them checking a cut or giving him some air
8160117 i went to the back i iced up everything that we had practiced for the last six weeks before that night i went through these trials plenty of times so i did it just like i did it in practice
8160118 i went to the back i started icing up massaging i took my reload that i had its like carbohydrates and protein i felt great within like 15 or 20 minutes i felt fully recovered i was icing up and all we had to do was keep that eye open
8160119 the doctors were checking it and everything seemed positive every time they came back to check it they seemed pretty positive so i was pretty excited to be able to finish this up finally they sent in like seven different doctors they all checked me i passed all of their tests they asked me how many fingers do i have up and whatnot i passed everything as far as i was concerned
8160120 finally the matchmaker came to me and was like they think if you go back out and get hit youre going to go blind they may even be concerned about you going blind right now like before you even go out there on the side of the white part of my eye there was a blood bubble coming off of my eye like protruding off of my eyeball they were concerned about that busting and me having vision problems
8160121 i understand keeping my safety in mind but i asked the guy is it anything 100 000 dollars cant fix i wanted that money man he looked at me and said seriously i cant let you go back out there i just started crying like a girl i couldnt deal with it i worked so hard
8160122 im not disappointed in anything that i did that night
8160123 the only thing im mad about and upset about is that i didnt get the big check that i wanted i could have used that money i seriously could have used that money other than that im not disappointed about anything i did everything that was in my control i worked hard for i controlled
8160124 the situation sucked because everything that i could control that night like my performance and getting the knockout and everything i was happy with i controlled everything that i was able to but it was just something that was beyond my control that im not used to
8160125 there was a failure of the master to exercise extraordinary diligence and good seamanship thereby committing an error of judgment

8160134 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8160135 i just thought he threw a string of outstanding pitches
8160136 in my book he was 10 for 10 in pitch execution going into the gerut at bat
8160137 hes obviously one of the premier tennis players of all time
8160138 he should generate a box office that will be complementary to the tournament

8160144 there is a good chance he was symptomatic a week or two coming up to this diagnosis

8160146 i had to give up the pizza and i dont eat out any more and i eat salads
8160147 it was tough but once you get your mind set to it and know you have to do it everything works out
8160148 companies must realize the different types of risks when they choosing world software teams or software outsourcing and judge each through a more exacting due diligence of the short listed offshore companies

8160150 at now the indian information technology and bpo industry is calculate roughly to be 22bn

8160157 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8160158 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8160159 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8160160 we need to put our foot on the throats of our opponents and put it there the whole game
8160161 we lacked that last year we got a big lead and then we got relaxed and we got satisfied this year we dont want to get satisfied we have to play full force every minute
8160162 defensively they have struggled stopping people consistently but i believe they will be a much improved team
8160163 i know they are excited about improving we are going to worry about us and be prepared for everything we can
8160164 we have to keep the foot on the accelerator and keep improving
8160165 its going to have an impact no question the team is already very thin in a lot of areas
8160166 antons a good athlete at a good age and there could be an international future for him very much so
8160167 our coaches can take him to another level and theres no reason why he cant be a top top player
8160168 ive got one more player in mind and im confident of getting that sorted
8160169 its a good sign were attracting this calibre of player as we wouldnt have been able to do that last season
8160170 the way he was playing i couldve sworn he was a scholarship player
8160171 when it comes down ill let you know i think it got stuck up there someplace
8160172 theyll both play quite a bit in this game theyre that close we just got to see to me its a name thats starting theyll both play
8160173 schools backed off because academically they werent sure pima coach bill laslett said
8160174 thats what happens if student athletes arent ready to go a lot of schools will move on and take care of that need arizona state obviously didnt forget
8160175 obviously hes a big physical corner and he can move and run
8160176 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8160177 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8160178 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8160179 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8160180 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8160181 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8160182 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8160183 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8160184 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8160185 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8160186 i hate the idea that whenever we have a bad game the solution is to go out and buy i dont know why were always under pressure to buy 30million or 40m players
8160187 i am not impressed by big names i am only impressed by attitude and quality all the rest is just hype
8160188 so if chelsea buy robinho frankly what can we do about it the answer is not to look at what chelsea manchester united or liverpool are doing
8160189 im not interested in comparing names i focus on my own players not the other teams the squad we have has enough quality and strength to win the champions league
8160190 if i can find one more player before the transfer deadline i will take him but one more player will not make that much difference
8160191 a good player is not necessarily linked with the price it is getting harder to buy the right players but the market is still there
8160192 at the moment we are struggling to find the right player
8160193 he had just played in texas and was coming back
8160194 he told me he was sweating and it was hurting badly i cant function he said
8160195 it was a kidney stone starting to pass and i was concerned ive had six of them
8160196 but the first part of the summer was mediocre its a tough transition you dont go straight to the pga im working this game out in my head
8160197 not nuts and bolts which is good i encourage him to keep playing by feel
8160198 but you have to know what causes things to happen and how to fix them a little bit of that aspect i dont tell him things but he will ask my advice sometimes look at a video of his swing
8160199 ben learned the right way so nobody is going to change his game
8160200 he has a lot of raw talent and he knows how to hit the ball
8160201 people assume with his size he can hit the ball far and he can
8160202 its a looping swing with power from his chest but even now he can hit it harder he works on his complete game and he has a very good wedge
8160203 i wanted to fine tune my game there under different conditions different shots in wind and rain on different courses it was one of the best things for me i have become well rounded
8160204 i still have putting issues but my confidence is back
8160205 i have had to learn that even though you go through a bad round you cant get down and think i might as well go home stay focused
8160206 they thought i was coming back to play jc ball
8160207 a couple of guys were like oh man youre going to be a four star recruit talk to me first
8160208 it was just crazy florida talked to me but i told them i was already here they were like for real and that was the end of that that was pretty cool but i would rather be here with these coaches and these players
8160209 there are a lot of unselfish guys here trying to help me learn
8160210 safety is one of the most difficult positions to learn
8160211 hes still learning techniques and understanding the complexities of playing at this type of level but hes had an awfully good camp
8160212 hes a very mature kid who had a chance to be a special player just like antoine
8160213 for us we have to have a lot of guys
8160214 were going to get them out there and let them go play that way we can invest reps in them and let them improve every day
8160215 but i think this might be one of the best groups we brought in
8160216 great panel discussion yesterday evening microsoft and adobe playing marginally happily together for a great session
8160217 basically we have no visual of the wreckage our divers have not seen it
8160218 we have recovered more body parts here they are just inside black plastic bags the body parts
8160219 we have no recovery of a body or even a torso they are small body parts
8160220 de blir ett fantastiskt lag f r v rt land
8160221 we urge president arroyo and the milf to resume the peace talks and put an end to the fighting in mindanao
8160222 we appeal to lawmakers and politicians to help sustain the peace process and not douse the flame of hope and peace in mindanao our people are suffering from the war in mindanao we all want peace
8160223 we cannot afford to be divided in the peace process because it will also divide our people we are now looking at how the mnlf and the milf can work together for peace in mindanao
8160224 tanto si votasteis por mi como si lo hicisteis por barack es tiempo ahora de unirnos como un solo partido con un prop sito com n
8160225 no hab is trabajado tan duro durante los ltimos 18 meses para sufrir m s por liderazgos fallidos es una lucha por el futuro y una lucha que debemos ganar
8160226 en frica todo empieza y todo acaba por las redes
8160227 frente a la l gica del capital la l gica de las tontinas es la de la reciprocidad frente a la l gica de la acumulaci n la banca popular favorece la r pida circulaci n del capital
8160228 en las elecciones de 2000 en kayes mal se ve c mo en esta regi n de emigraci n la mayor a de electos locales han pasado por la vida asociativa por la emigraci n y son todos antiguos emigrantes
8160229 para inscribirlo en una l gica real de cambio es necesario habilitar a los actores populares a modificar las reglas de juego decisional y a introducir sus propias reglas
8160230 el desarrollo depende de los hombres es necesario dar apoyo a aquel que desea desarrollarse teniendo en cuenta cual es su concepci n de desarrollo
8160231 frica no necesita ser ayudada o asistida necesita sobre todo ser reconocida y considerada
8160232 tontines and the banking system is there a case for building linkages
8160233 migrantes protagonistas del desarrollo una mediaci n en dos espacios
8160234 jag har alltid fascinerats av s dant som blivit ratat som de d r udda spelningarna en musiker g r som inte kommer med p skivan
8160235 f r mig handlar det om platser som har en historia platser som n r vi kommit till dem i princip har varit vergivna att vi kanske kan gjuta nytt mod i en s dan by r n gonting mer n att bara sl upp en pl tl da p ett k pf lt
8160236 bj rkvin r till exempel ett danskt m rke som har haft en formidabel utveckling i danmark r vi lite vakna kan vi presentera nyheter p den svenska marknaden trots att vi jobbar med verskott
8160237 fick just ett mejl fr n en person som nnu inte vaknat ur f rs songsdr mmen
8160238 v r tilltro till att sony ericsson ska kunna st rka sin position har f rsvagats ytterligare d de senaste produktlanseringarna var en besvikelse
8160239 ryssland kan finna att det hamnat i en mycket farlig isolering om ingen annan stat st der abchaziens och sydossetiens sj lvst ndighet
8160240 h r m ste man se hur l ngt ryssland n tt de senaste ren n r det g ller att bygga upp kontakter med till exempel arabv rlden det r inte om jligt att turkiet iran syrien eller jordanien kan st dja ryssland i detta men det r os kert
8160241 m nga ryska regioner nu f r ett nytt argument f r sj lvst ndighet det m ste man se klart till exempel kan stabiliseringen i norra kaukasus se mycket annorlunda ut nu
8160242 nordkaukasus ser moskvas beslut som ett uttryck f r en beslutsamhet och styrka som det ofta har saknat de senaste ren men denna gl dje kan f ljas av en helt annorlunda reaktion
8160243 skyldighet att h lla dessa republiker flytande speciellt om ingen annan erk nner dem
8160244 v st kommer att skapa barri rer f r rysk aff rsverksamhet och kommer att komplicera visumfr gor men man kommer inte att pressa ryssland alltf r mycket av oro f r att f rlora chanserna till dialog
8160245 naturligtvis var alla negativa konsekvenser v ntade utbrott av uppr rdhet och hot fr n europa och usa och latent ovilja fr n l nder med etniska problem som kina
8160246 men ryssland har bevisat de h r dagarna att man inte vinner n got med hot och att isolering r meningsl s eftersom det inte p n got s tt r fastst llt vem som r mest beroende av den andre
8160247 there is no longer a case for taking 4 billion a year from the public to produce programmes they do not want or can obtain free elsewhere
8160248 the world has moved on since the days when the bbc was central to british life any modern government that fails to acknowledge this fact is quite simply defying the will of the people
8160249 corporate gigantism and belief in a unique moral mission have made the bbc what it is today and yet both are of vanishingly small concern to viewers and listeners
8160250 the bbc internally is not neutral about multiculturalism it believes in it and promotes diversity lets face up to that
8160251 it must seek respect not for what it is but for what it does
8160252 the bbcs remit is to produce a volume of high quality programmes with much reduced output its long tradition of producing fine programmes and a budget of 4 million a day it should be able to achieve it triumphantly
8160253 the english democrats are offering a fresh start and reject the clich ridden and spin politics of the past we offer the politics of a common national identity and common values our politics are riddled with spin and political correctness a vote for the english democrats is a vote for honest and plain speaking
8160254 there should be an immediate referendum on the eu lisbon treaty it is wholly wrong for labour to try to impose this treaty on us contrary to their own specific manifesto commitment that there should be a referendum the people of the republic of ireland have said no we want our say
8160255 there should be free residential car for the elderly as is available in scotland it is wrong that pensioners homes in england are being seized to pay for this
8160256 we also demand access to all nhs drugs not a
8160257 there should be an end to the unjustified subsidies to other parts of the uk we want a fair system for all
8160258 england can no longer sustain uncontrolled mass immigration it should be stopped it places an unacceptable strain on all our services all previous governments have allowed this situation to get out of control
8160259 the government should seek to protect society and not the criminals
8160260 there should be an english parliament with an english prime minister and government with at least the same powers as the scottish ones
8160261 the voters of haltemprice and howden have the chance to send a clear message to the government and the rest of the stale political establishment that the people of england are no longer prepared to be treated as second class citizens within the uk let us put englands interests first
8160262 i am convinced that standing still is not an option the present arrangements are producing growing resentment all over the united kingdom particularly in england
8160263 a vote for joanne and the english democrats is a positive vote for the people of haltemprice and howden it is a vote for england and for an english parliament first minister and government for england
8160264 i will impress upon them the need to avoid prejudicing the process which we must now undertake in ireland
8160265 accord us the time we need to play our part in understanding last weeks vote
8160266 one of the main goals will be to calm the europeans down and not inflame the situation either in the eu or back at home any further
8160267 it will be made clear to the eu partners that it is politically impossible for ireland to have a rerun
8160268 i think you have excellently designed institutions for the budget process in an independent state or a state with substantial fiscal autonomy
8160269 barnett is unsustainable in the long run it is neither efficient nor equitable
8160270 it gives perverse incentives to the devolved administrations their block grant is a function of a number they cannot control
8160271 in turn their decisions have consequences which the uk government cannot fully control
8160272 it probably derives not from greater need but from the more credible threat to the union of the united kingdom that they pose
8160273 prof mcleans evidence points to one of devolutions fundamental flaws that we are spending money without direct responsibility for raising it
8160274 it is time to look again at how we fund our policy priorities
8160275 we may have to say well look were not happy with this situation here are some of the powers wed like to have back but we cant give you that referendum on the lisbon treaty because its already been put in place across the rest of europe
8160276 mutterings about regime change used to be confined to the fringes of the party but now there is a more widespread view that gordon will have to go unless he can win back public support
8160277 tamsin delivers for crewe and nantwich you told tamsin your concerns she put them directly to the chancellor she stood up for you
8160278 i think you will find he is not the type of lawyer he claims to be
8160279 it would not surprise us if labour was stooping to this level its entire campaign has been marked by mean spirited stunts and dirty tricks
8160280 carter tells anyone who will listen that james is the best thing since sliced bread
8160281 one way of unseating him would be through a war of attrition with relentless carefully placed attacks laying the ground for a delegation of elder statesmen the men in suits
8160282 asked what he would be in another life it would be a salesman car dealer pr guy estate agent and worst of all a foxtons estate agent
8160283 government in the uk is now so large diverse and complex that it is impossible for anyone to manage effectively let alone by ministers with no prior experience of management and little in depth understanding of the work carried out by their departments government today tries to do too much and consequently fails the structure of government needs to change if we hope to see better value and significant improvements in our public services
8160284 do you think that regeneration is adding a new wing to your mansion
8160285 have you and your tory mates on the council been soft on yobs and failed to make our streets safer
8160286 flatters some of the most chauvinistic and backward looking parts of british society
8160287 is a small price to pay for saving the union
8160288 we are worried about the reports of ken drinking too much if we lost london it would be a political disaster and gordon knows that
8160289 in my view ken livingstone would do a better job if he drank less i fear we have an alcohol fuelled mayoralty
8160290 well im concerned about the amount im drinking because its nothing like enough
8160291 the english are awakening to the unfairness of the barnett formula and to the democratic deficit in the way in which we are governed
8160292 come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue if england to itself do rest but true
8160293 look if england got its own parliament and the union broke up what would happen to all the scottish people living in england and all the english people living in scotland
8160294 the truth the whole truth and anything but the truth
8160295 in some of the more heavily populated urban areas of the country family life is quite frankly in meltdown or completely unrecognisable
8160296 in some areas of the country even including the more urban parts of the sleepy west in which i operate family life in the old sense no longer exists
8160297 so i suggest the general collapse of ordinary family life because of the breakdown of families in this country is on a scale depth and breadth which few of us could have imagined even a decade ago
8160298 what is certain is that almost all of societys social ills can be traced directly to the collapse of the family life
8160299 most children and young people in england today are safe healthy and achieve well
8160300 the new brownvilles will be the same old projects that developers have been trying to squeeze through planning for ages greenwashed to suit the zeitgeist commuter dormitories with low energy knobs on
8160301 immigration is responsible for at least 70 per cent of the uks projected population increase which will take the uk from 61 million today to 85 million by 2081
8160302 the environmental consequences of such a massive population rise are alarming they include loss of countryside and green space and all the psychological stresses that come with high population densities overcrowding and loss of tranquillity
8160303 the alternative vote has many attractions including the fact that you have to get 50 plus one in that constituency therefore you have a greater legitimacy
8160304 it should not be about parties choosing a system that will most advantage themselves its about a voting system that delivers democracy for all of us
8160305 i dont understand how it can cause offence it is our country after all
8160306 home office policy precludes applications with tattoos on lower arm hand face or neck that are prominent which may cause offence and or invite provocation from the public or colleagues
8160307 a family who arent of english origin who see england on your arm could feel you might discriminate against them
8160308 we live in a diverse society and try to ensure we give everybody equality
8160309 but im now looking at other options like the fire service or prison service
8160310 this tattoo was clearly visible as it does not meet our rigorous standards his application was rejected
8160311 i expect they will want to ensure that the same type of collateral for central bank loans is taken here as it is by the fed and european central bank
8160312 i think the issue here is much more about ensuring that as peaks and troughs hit central banks are prepared to act and provide liquidity if liquidity is required
8160313 the bank of england is very keen to ensure that we have good strong confidence in our market after all weve got good strong banks
8160314 make it clearer what it means to be a citizen
8160315 practical measures that may help enhance a sense of shared belonging
8160316 my report makes a range of proposals that touch every stage of an individuals life my proposals are intended to promote the meaning and significance of citizenship within modern britain
8160317 in terms of a british national day what may be beneficial is a new public holiday to celebration the bond of shared citizenship
8160318 it can be a pledge of commitment to the country it can be a statement of what the rights and responsibilities of citizens are
8160319 we already teach schoolchildren what citizenship means but it would make sense to have a coming of age ceremony which marks the moment they move from being a student of citizenship to being a real citizen in themselves
8160320 a half baked idea that should be left to go mouldy
8160321 i see this as an empty gesture to ask 16 year olds to troop into a hall and like americans put their hands on their heart and take an oath of allegiance is risible
8160322 we dont support it and neither do the vast majority of parents teachers and children in scotland
8160323 there is corruption in any government there is always corruption its bad when it is more than 15 per cent
8160324 the public has the right to view their own votes
8160325 these kinds of voting machines enable fraud on a scale and simplicity previously unknown
8160326 i prefer incompetence over evil as an explanation for discrepancies
8160327 machines make errors we see that repeatedly as we have taken a look at election outcomes you dont always get the same count
8160328 if you want a paper trail its expensive it also has inaccuracies and if one county does it then the whole state has to do it
8160329 i dont see us making a major change by november
8160330 we have over 5 million worth of electronic voting equipment 4 1 million of which was given to us by the state
8160331 the cost of fuel is a big big challenge for the city of austin
8160332 what we are doing is really being smart about how we use our resources
8160333 every dollar that were using for fuel costs is a dollar that we dont have for other costs and other challenges that we have
8160334 i read quite a few of them and my initial disbelief turned to a burning desire to discredit and disprove these people
8160335 i felt that debunking the self help book is itself a form of self help
8160336 as professor in the business school i am telling you it is just clever marketing these books are a dime a dozen and very few of them make it to the top the ones that do have a good marketing strategy
8160337 the ipod will become the dominant device people will use so if a university does not find a way to take advantage of them as teaching tools its going to be unfortunate
8160338 for ut there is no reason to employ those methods
8160339 for us we wanted to engage our students in the learning process enhance the lines of communication
8160340 we wanted students to use technologies they were already familiar with in new ways
8160341 this is an independent initiative from apple or at amp t
8160342 for us we thought this initiative was compelling enough and promising enough that we will divert reassign monies we were spending in other ways
8160343 i think it can be done without breaking the bank
8160344 miss university a girls guide to fitness beauty and confidence
8160345 the media gives women a false sense of what beauty is
8160346 people think beauty equals skinny but in reality anyone can be toned and fit
8160347 while youre an undergraduate i would expect that it would be an extraordinarily rare event to be published
8160348 the book has a christian angle in that working out is all about honoring your body and living for what god has called you to do on this earth
8160349 diana thinks its important to take care of ourselves and it has nothing to do with looks commercials billboards
8160350 she is a very good role model for the next generation of girls
8160351 we were impressed by her research and the application of the research when we saw reading scores begin to rise
8160352 when the opportunity came to expand her past the literacy issue it was an easy decision to continue to make the investment in her program
8160353 building the b reactor was a feat of engineering genius so too was the construction a testament to the excellence of working americans
8160354 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
8160355 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
8160356 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
8160357 im sad they didnt come but i gave myself a 50 50 percent chance
8160358 maybe obama didnt want to give the impression he was favoring us
8160359 maybe to obama texas is far too republican for him you know whats the point
8160360 in general i think itd be good to have a political environment on campus its good for discussion
8160361 there is the potential for a worldwide pandemic if the current strains of avian flu circulating in birds throughout asia europe and africa move into the human population
8160362 for these reasons research into the molecular basis of flu biology is important and perhaps critical to health and human commerce
8160363 this has been a record year for ut in national science foundation funding primarily because we received a very large award for the super computer 59 million
8160364 good proposals get funding but of course as the budget decreases in real dollars agencies will award less money per proposal or their rejection rate will go up
8160365 these are resulting in the overall economy decreasing and hopefully that will change and the federal government will find will in the funding of research investment
8160366 this is the first time two women of color are running on a national ticket nationwide
8160367 but i dont think itll have a big impact on the campaign
8160368 the stringent ballot laws in texas are the hardest in the u s to get candidates on the ballot
8160369 but that doesnt diminish the campaigns in texas or nationwide in texas voters have more voices and more choices in this election
8160370 we cant afford to buy our way onto the ballot
8160371 we feel money should not stand in the way of democracy the two party system has bankrupt this state
8160372 i think it might hurt obamas campaign because the 08 race will be really close
8160373 its a concern but it might motivate more people to get out and vote instead of just wearing a button
8160374 thats really our goal to use a method of cleaning that is going to provide the healthiest environment for our workers the students and anyone in our work area
8160375 each one of them is watching out for each other
8160376 before i came here i worked three years as a custodian in a high school but we didnt get any training about how we can get a team together and do work together
8160377 i was so happy about the training i take my work very very seriously and i like to know more about how to do my job
8160378 our training has helped improve the quality of cleaning of our campus
8160379 were trying to get our buildings to be green clean and green
8160380 the major thing is that its dropped off significantly and were optimistic
8160381 its 9 now what if it drops to 7 its a guess thats why we buy a little bit at a time
8160382 patients of the bush doctors and richford gate medical practice in hammersmith and fulham primary care trust will soon receive automated voice messages requesting information to update their medical record the free service will send an automated voice message to a patients mobile asking them to confirm whether they smoke or not
8160383 the department of health is this week expected to set out its vision for information prescriptions that are linked to electronic patient records and a national accredited information system based within nhs choices the final report on the first 20 pilots that ran over the last year is currently with ministers and could be published this week
8160384 the bottom of the housing downturn is coming into view
8160385 we need to see more of the same kind of reports over the next few months showing increasing affordability and a reduction in inventory
8160386 its therapeutic that these foreclosed properties are being sold off at deep discounts
8160387 theres no question people are getting values today better than they could have dreamed of getting two years ago
8160388 were starting to see some of things we need to form a bottom in the next six to 12 months
8160389 it was the most perfect time to start a web site about zune and i was one of the first few to create a zune related site
8160390 bidding was getting close to the buy it now price and i didnt want to lose zuneboards over a few thousand dollars
8160391 my first acquisition was a graphic site from someone in italy i was blown away when i found out he was 16
8160392 at first i tried to teach myself with books i would buy from bookstores however ultimately i was mostly self taught from other web development communities like
8160393 the internet is an amazing place you can practically learn anything you want if youre willing to make a time commitment
8160394 i only spent 30 minutes online a day on zuneboards
8160395 they dont get the respect of advertisers the bigger you are the higher the advertisers will pay for the same advertising inventory
8160396 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
8160397 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
8160398 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
8160399 the market continues to question the same things and were not really getting any answers
8160400 i think thats one of the reasons why people are staying on the sidelines
8160401 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
8160402 this is a response to a slower traffic period and were giving ourselves some operational flexibility in the winter months
8160403 when you have 30 frequencies a day are you going to miss one or two come on
8160404 dies ist wahrscheinlich eine der gr ten krisen die wir seit dem ende des kalten krieges seit beginn der 90er jahre haben
8160405 widerspricht dem prinzip der territorialen integrit t einem grundlegenden prinzip des internationalen v lkerrechts und ist deshalb absolut nicht akzeptabel
8160406 wir m ssen als europ ische union alles daran setzen dass wir georgien und genauso der ukraine im rahmen unserer nachbarschaftspolitik beistehen
8160407 dedicated to serving responsive to needs innovative in programing respectful of differences and compassionate toward others are woven into our organization and the services we provide we look forward to the future and the continued opportunity to help children and families build upon their strengths and in return create a healthier community

8160410 my name is denny and im s hopping with my mother
8160411 thats a cool name i wish my name was denny but my name is hal
8160412 youre fifteen years old denny now be a good good boy and let the man pass by
8160413 oh im probably just a dandelion but i sure love living in gods garden
8160414 the hunger strike period was generally a time when nationalist commitment to the struggle was heightened and refreshed but since then there have been concerted enemy efforts to confuse and demoralise
8160415 i think you have to deal with two separate circumstances it had little effect internally because people who are actively involved understand the situation and what the enemy is trying to achieve the use of
8160416 when the governor comes into your cell youre supposed to stand up but we just sat down anywhere on the bed on the chair
8160417 it is a waste of time shouting up the ira the important thing is to join
8160418 without giving us the exact details because i know you cant are there any teasers you can share about krystal
8160419 there are some challenges with kathy kate but it goes beyond what most step mothers have to face
8160420 how difficult is it to work with the babies little kids on the show
8160421 its a challenge you cant expect them to be able to do what the adults to its a tricky genre but with the kids its slow moving you have to have patience especially with the babies theyre crying and its stressful i hate that but the kids are so adorable there is nothing cuter that a little baby
8160422 i love that dress even when it was shredded and dirty i still loved it technically it was a 2 3 day thing on screen it took weeks to shoot it i asked them to send it out to clean it and hopefully ill get it back so i can wear it again
8160423 who are the most memorable characters that youve worked with on amc or b amp b
8160424 could you give us a most embarrassing moment from the show
8160425 i fell once coming down the stairs of the chandler mansion i think i was in my pregnancy pad too and there was water on the floor and i slipped i wasnt hurt but its was very embarrassing because i hit the floor and just flew they used it in the christmas reel usually the reel is full of michael knight tad but i got in there
8160426 i want total control of restless style just watch me get it
8160427 i married chloe it was supposed to be you ill never stop loving you
8160428 youll never guess who the new ceo of newman enterprises is
8160429 si bien tanto el rodeo como las domaduras tuvieron su origen en actividades ligadas propiamente a la agricultura conteo y adiestramiento de los caballos y reses hoy en d a no s lo ya no tienen ninguna raz n de ser sino que se mantienen exclusivamente por el beneficio econ mico que de ellas extraen los recintos los organizadores los municipios etc

8160431 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single technology
8160432 it will prompt for a sun employee number and the corresponding password
8160433 it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit
8160434 presiden waktu itu adalah sebagai menko polkam jadi tidak ada urusannya
8160435 keputusan semacam itu dilihat saja siapa selidiki saja siapa yang bertanggung jawab siapa yang negosiasi dan apa segala macam
8160436 bilang sama pak kalla beliau juga ada di situ sama sby
8160437 kita sudah bilang sama panitia dan televisi itu supaya dimulai aja acaranya tapi ternyata mereka nggak mulai juga
8160438 kalau berkoalisi dengan golkar mereka minta presidennya juga dengan demokrat agak susah kalau seperti itu
8160439 ada senior seperti amien rais bambang dibyo abdillah toha am fatwa sedangkan generasi baru ada zulkifli hasan didik rachbini alvin lie kita akan mengusung kader terbaiknya sehingga nanti perolehan suaranya signifikan untuk mencalonkan karena ruu pilpres belum selesai
8160440 ini bisa membahayakan pemimpin populer tapi tidak berkarakter misalnya maaf ya pedangdut yang tidak punya pengalaman mencalonkan diri jadi wakil walikota di sebuah kota di salah satu propinsi di indonesia ini ada kesedihan bagi saya meski itu sah sah saja

8160449 i think that schweitzers role was to be the partisan attack dog heading into hillary clintons speech

8160469 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8160470 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8160471 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8160472 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8160473 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8160474 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8160475 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8160476 as a member of the transportation community we experience the disastrous effects the rising price of fuel is having on companies
8160477 every day more and more truckers are losing jobs and more and more trucking companies are declaring bankruptcy we have to do what we can to help stop the bleeding

8160481 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8160482 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8160483 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8160484 the best thing about our store is our family of employees

8160490 as a member of the opposition alliance pakatan rakyat we will agree to support anwar as opposition leader to replace his wife
8160491 i am not sure that pas is convinced that he can get 30 government mps to cross over
8160492 he may not have the credibility needed to keep the country together
8160493 i think the main contents of his anwars policies are sound and they do make sense economically over the long run because it should have a positive impact on malaysias competitiveness
8160494 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
8160495 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8160496 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8160497 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8160499 with the ever changing it marketplace and the always growing needs of the hd distribution industry the board and manageemnt team realized that hdx could not effecively meet those needs on its own we recognized that the stand alone not for profit structure of hdx lacked the resources required both financially and physically to grow with the industry and the world of it
8160500 datalliance has been one of hdxs best supporters over the years as both a customer and a vendor partner so this is an ideal fit
8160501 hdx will benefit from the years of experience datalliance has in running a technology based company as well as the additional strategic and financial resources it brings to the table
8160502 hdx has effected a significant amount of change in this industry over the last 10 years
8160503 with datalliance we increase our financial backing giving us an opportunity to expand the reach of our services and support of those services
8160504 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8160505 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8160506 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8160507 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8160508 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8160509 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful

8160517 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

8160520 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8160521 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8160522 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8160523 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8160524 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8160525 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8160526 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8160527 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8160528 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8160529 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8160530 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8160531 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8160532 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8160533 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8160534 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8160535 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8160536 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8160537 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8160538 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8160539 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8160540 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8160541 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8160542 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8160543 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8160544 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8160545 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8160546 its been a long time since renee and her two friends have gotten together for a girls night in
8160547 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8160548 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8160549 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8160550 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8160551 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8160552 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8160553 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8160554 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8160555 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8160556 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8160557 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8160558 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8160559 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8160560 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8160561 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8160562 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8160563 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8160564 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8160565 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8160566 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8160567 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8160568 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8160569 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8160570 its more than an extracurricular activity it becomes your life
8160571 i had the opportunity to do deals with a number of record labels but im confident about my music and the future of bandstocks which seems to be a much more honest and transparent way to release records

8160675 we dont want the focus of the car free day to be about parking and towing
8160676 here in king county just as our ridership is surging higher fuel costs and lower tax revenues from a faltering economy are creating a growing deficit in our metro budget
8160677 we must do all we can to keep our buses running and maintain our existing transit service
8160678 its very important to him and metro because of the very unusual circumstances
8160679 were seeing these huge increases in demands for service so its the worst possible time to scale back we have to scramble
8160680 its an open and active investigation and a very important case
8160681 he remains a person of interest in the case and a strong person at that he hasnt confessed to us he has confessed to the fbi
8160682 because this is such a large jackpot very few people would sit on it if they had the ticket
8160683 we have to assume that whoever has it doesnt know
8160684 it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars before its over potentially it could be in the low millions we wont know until the coupons come in for processing
8160685 in order to protect our retailers and all of you responsible coupon users all coupons will now be considered invalid copies we are working with all the industry players and word is going out to the retailers not to accept them
8160686 i really felt like a fool and was quite embarrassed when i was scrutinized for attempting to use these coupons this past saturday
8160687 its clear to our knowledge that there were no security features associated with these coupons
8160688 if youre going to do internet coupons you should exercise appropriate controls
8160689 i think the whole coupon trading community ought to be commended
8160690 they immediately recognized there was no security associated with these coupons and starting warning each other
8160691 there are 40 coupons in wide circulation with no controls
8160692 theres a reasonable chance were going to be dealing with this for a couple of years
8160693 for alternative schools in general theyre not the primary focus
8160694 were so used to not having the best and here we walk into a brand new building
8160695 after all that extraordinary outrage directed at me not one person has called me up and said hey brian it looks like you might have had a point after all
8160696 we say bush is so blinded by ideology that he ignores the facts in the real world and thats true
8160697 arent we doing the same thing were being just like bush
8160698 one of the most severe tongue lashings ive ever seen administered to a public official at least face to face
8160699 we ought to just say that it worked people were understandably skeptical of the administration at the time but we have to acknowledge reality do you stay with a political position because its popular even if it doesnt square with the facts
8160700 the people in our party advocating for an immediate withdrawal of troops last year had gotten their way it would have been disastrous for the u s
8160701 we buried quite a lot of people during the surge
8160702 it was such a titanic misjudgement to start the war in the first place that my belief is the only way to undo that ultimately is to leave completely
8160703 what why in the world did you pick all guys dorm for
8160704 this has been the most devastating fire weve seen in recent memory
8160705 i dont think in any society they ought to be able to just throw people out
8160706 diese alberne ausgrenzungspolitik diese fortsetzung des kalten krieges mit l cherlichen mitteln bald beendet ist

8160708 das sollte die csu bedenken wenn sie jetzt ihre kreuzritterr stungen gegen die linke anlegt vielleicht kommen sie dann um die abtr nnigen cdu leute hinzurichten die sich mit uns eingelassen haben
8160709 dass diese alberne ausgrenzungspolitik diese fortsetzung des kalten krieges mit l cherlichen mitteln bald beendet ist
8160710 unsere ausgrenzung funktioniert teilweise ja nur noch weil die spd parteif hrung sich von der cdu durchs land treiben l sst
8160711 die spd spitze hat angst vor der cdu aber ich wei nicht wie lange die spd dazu braucht bis sie es sich wieder zutraut selbstst ndig zu denken und zu entscheiden

8160714 it was an honor to be asked to be a debutante and it was a highlight not just for you but for your family
8160715 if there was something that needed to be done and you didnt have enough money or materials to do it mrs murray could get it done
8160716 we understand that our goal was to be the best educated women we could be
8160717 i like the phrase imagine no religion because it doesnt make a judgment
8160718 if we dont make our presence known as the nonreligious then religion just wins by default
8160719 i think theres a relentless challenge to anything christian on the part of the minority who are atheistic and agnostic
8160720 the danger to the separation of church and state has never been greater
8160721 its hard for anyone to argue that religion is disadvantaged in the united states where religion is everywhere participating in public life politics
8160722 the point of the billboard is to inspire one person to one thing

8160725 threatening to waste even more taxpayer dollars in their attempt to establish a totally undefined and subjective standard for city contracting
8160726 it is regrettable that i am now caught in the middle of a disagreement over the interpretation of law
8160727 the issue has become very personal for councilman mciver and i dont think he cares about the appearance at this point
8160728 i think he cares about being treated fairly and because of that he will use the letter of the law to his benefit without concern about political appearance
8160729 we make a lot of judgment calls and as long as were acting transparently and without unlawful intent it seems we should be indemnified
8160730 im very confident that its not representative of what our kids can do
8160731 we have obviously tortured ourselves for days trying to figure this out

8160782 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny
8160783 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership

8160807 this is a response to a slower traffic period and were giving ourselves some operational flexibility in the winter months
8160808 were the ones who are going to pay the price were taxpayers and we had to go to the expense of hiring an attorney to plead our case with the state against a big company

8160820 were just trying to bring good music to all the students for cheap or free
8160821 bob doesnt get much radio airplay but he is a local austinite and is really popular
8160822 plus he caters to a lot of peoples tastes not just country and were trying to attract a large fan base hes really the perfect artist for a show like this
8160823 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8160824 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8160825 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8160826 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8160827 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8160828 i guess i made a mistake in cutting a joke
8160829 julio you know what i actually ran into julio in the spring recruiting
8160830 i said hello to him and said i guess ill be seeing you at the end of august then he got out and got in his escalade and drove off thats serious
8160831 and then i went over and watched alabama freshman burton scott at vigor high school at the track over there
8160832 and burton scott was running around he went and got in his escalade out at track practice and drove off so im familiar with those two guys
8160833 i think duanes the best at that in the country and we overloaded him last year
8160834 we took him out of the positions hes helped us so much at and it really hurt us last year hes so excited about having it back so it will be a factor
8160835 we dont have a gunner or a main blocker or anything

8160840 aunque ayuda tambi n exige cuidar al m ximo el uso del espacio
8160841 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8160842 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8160843 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8160844 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8160845 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8160846 whilst some nazi propaganda was simply out right crude statements of hate people like goebbels realized that to be really effective propaganda had to be faintly credible that it had to subtly massage peoples already extant prejudices
8160847 the debased and ignorant self interest that grips jerseys elite like a cancer
8160848 but perhaps more fundamentally than this you are simply thick
8160849 i am a true jerseyman of a very ancient pedigee
8160850 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8160851 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8160852 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8160853 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8160854 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8160855 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8160856 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8160857 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8160858 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8160859 he is just so comfortable with the government he is a great speaker hes a great orator and hes been a senator for a long time hes a down to earth person and a good match for the ticket
8160860 i think obama is going to surround himself with the people he needs
8160861 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8160862 il crisantemo che per noi il fiore dei morti in cina giappone e nei paesi anglosassoni simbolo di gioia vitalit e pace
8160863 i think it was extremely disrespectful of the school board to bring back the same budget after we voted it down the last time
8160864 i cant believe in such a small town how far apart people are
8160865 they should concentrate on what they did before arithmetic spelling geography history
8160866 the rest should be in high school and college the education we got years ago was just as good
8160867 we are going to have to cut the budget significantly unfortunately
8160868 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8160869 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8160870 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8160871 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8160872 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8160873 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8160874 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8160875 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8160876 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8160877 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8160878 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8160879 income poverty and health insurance coverage in the united states 2007
8160880 last month alone our food pantry served up to 700 people
8160881 six new homeless families showed up at my office monday
8160882 ive probably had 35 people who are on a waiting list call me this week
8160883 i think the perception is that more people are having trouble even if they are higher up in the socioeconomic stratus because of prices
8160884 i would say the census report is not a surprise
8160885 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8160886 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8160887 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8160888 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8160889 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8160890 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8160891 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8160892 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8160893 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8160894 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8160895 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8160896 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8160897 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8160898 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8160899 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8160900 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8160901 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8160902 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8160903 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8160904 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8160905 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8160906 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8160907 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8160908 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8160909 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8160910 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8160911 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8160912 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8160913 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8160914 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8160915 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8160916 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8160917 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8160918 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8160919 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8160920 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8160921 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8160922 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8160923 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8160924 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8160925 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8160926 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream

8160935 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8160936 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

8160944 many of those brought to us suffered nose and ear pain as the pressure in the cabin was lost
8160945 the ear injuries were then aggravated by the swift loss of altitude those brought to us had severe headaches nosebleeds and damaged eardrums
8160946 most were also suffering from shock but thankfully they are all expected to make a full recovery
8160947 suddenly there was a roar of wind a rush of cold air the oxygen masks dropped you didnt know what was going on
8160948 you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft
8160949 it was incredibly cold my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
8160950 he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
8160951 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating
8160952 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8160953 i was surprised there seemed to be no communication between the pilot and the flight attendants because they didnt seem to know what to say and do
8160954 there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear
8160955 thumping noise then a rush of very cold air through the cabin people began shouting out in fear
8160956 when something like that happens people obviously think they are going to die
8160957 everyone began reaching for their masks babies started crying people clung on to each other some were being sick it was a truly frightening moment
8160958 passengers sometimes misunderstand they expect a surge of oxygen when in actual fact there is a steady stream of oxygen
8160959 the oxygen masks were working and the correct procedures were followed as soon as the captain got the plane down to 8 000ft he did make the appropriate announcement that they were going to divert to limoges for safety reasons
8160960 this is always a traumatic experience for passengers but the crew dealt with it appropriately

8161011 this one will be on the east coast because we want to keep the shipping costs low and we want to get the product to the customer as fast as possible
8161012 every product is finished within three days at the latest after we have received the order
8161013 for we are literally flooded with orders during this season people not only want to get greeting cards done but also calendars or photo books to give them away
8161014 sometimes a company is as much defined by what it doesnt do as much as by what it does
8161015 we have reinvented our business model but at the core we are still a paper printer and want to stay that
8161016 we have tried to mount our own web site attracting consumers to it
8161017 but it quickly exceeded our capacities its a different business
8161018 we decided early to focus on our efforts on web site design and online marketing and to outsource our printing services mostly complicated products like photo books calendars or notepads
8161019 rpi is not the only printer that works with us but it delivers high quality products in time for our customers
8161020 we try to target specific groups with our designs for example young or old people a typical young design looks like this colorful with a modern rather simple pattern with straight lines or boxes
8161021 but the vast majority of folks doing printing at home are just printing standard 4 by 6 inch photos people just dont have the time to make things and frankly the ink and paper supplies for home color printers are quite expensive
8161022 its about binding techniques and we make books with up to 220 pages who would do this at home
8161023 what is really important for us the market for digital cameras is still growing
8161024 statistically every second u s household owns a digital camera already today just think about the progress made with cellphones soon we will have even more models with integrated cameras and the technology will be much more advanced
8161025 and we will try to get a big piece of the cake
8161026 it took me one day of driving around bangalore india to see the opportunity was unbelievable

8161028 as we look to the second half of the year and into 2009 we expect the environment to remain as difficult as were seeing now
8161029 its about as dangerous as it can get when a mother sets up her own child for this
8161030 consumers really need this information to make choices when hiring a busing company to transport their children
8161031 theres always been that male hierarchy and women are still often considered the homemakers
8161032 i think the fact that it went up was more of a necessity
8161033 incomes should be equal and i think womens will continue gradually increasing
8161034 as we have stated consistently like everyone involved in the tragic valdez accident exxon mobil is anxious to have the matter resolved
8161035 we approached the plaintiffs legal representatives with an offer to pay the punitive damages awarded by the supreme court on june 25 less certain costs and amounts relating to earlier settlements with former plaintiffs the amount agreed with the plaintiffs is approximately 383 4 million
8161036 how can they property owners evaluate for instance if they want to cooperate if they dont know where the fence is going to go
8161037 i think before you take anyones property they have a right to know what youre taking
8161038 they will lose a view of the river and gain a view of an 18 foot fence
8161039 you could be out here one day and the next day you couldnt be you take everyday like its your last day
8161040 they just need to keep working day in and day out at practice and in the weight room
8161041 and make sure they take care of their class so there arent any distractions when they get to game time
8161042 its all the same because we were all working hard no matter if he was there
8161043 now were just working hard and we have a rotation with me and brent nickerson and were just working hard were just gonna see who fights it out until next saturday
8161044 around the country no judges are staying up late awaiting the final appeals from the condemned
8161045 governors and justices of the supreme court are not worrying that the person about to be executed may be the exceptional one who is innocent prison guards family members of victims and of death row inmates and even the media are relieved of the tension and uncertainty that each pending execution brings
8161046 but much of the death penalty system remains unaffected by this hold on executions
8161047 prosecutions trials appeals and the rituals of death row continue to absorb an enormous share of the judicial systems time and resources justices from some of the states highest courts have complained about the extraordinary strain this one issue places on the bench in many states there are not enough qualified lawyers willing to handle the appeals
8161048 the time for a dispassionate impartial comparison of the enormous costs that death penalty litigation imposes on society with the benefits that it produces has surely arrived
8161049 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8161050 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8161051 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8161052 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8161053 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8161054 it sounds kind of weird if you want to know the truth
8161055 prijatelji vrijeme je da vratimo zemlju koju volimo bez obzira jeste li glasovali za mene ili za baracka vrijeme je da se sada ujedinimo kao jedna stranka s jednim ciljem

8161083 he is a lot more personal of a guy than morriss
8161084 he has a fire for the game that really rubs off on you he is very personal toward you and because of that you want to win he is a players coach
8161085 by playing that hard schedule you have the opportunity to send a message to the nation saying hey were back this is a new era of baylor football and were here to play
8161086 if we can get 120 plays im all for it i like the clock rule and i think coach mike gundy and everybody agrees on offense it lends itself to our tempos that we like to do
8161087 were already used to it so weve kind of got a little bit of an edge
8161088 the coaches have adjusted the tempo but of course we are fast paced anyway so were just gonna do what we do
8161089 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8161090 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8161091 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8161092 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8161093 if i can id like to go ahead and go just to stay sharp
8161094 we only have three quarterbacks and weve got to have two guys ready to play
8161095 i would have never imagined last year when i was in the stands that i would be the starting kicker this year

8161097 its an opportunity for me and hell be back i have to make the best of it and have a blast
8161098 its all mental i cant make myself worry about how many people are there or how big the game is
8161099 to me it should be just like kicking up in steamboat it definitely will be different but in a good way

8161121 sixteen regular season games i think is enough but four preseason games is too many
8161122 if you work at the gap and they add two more hours to your schedule you would expect to get two more hours worth of pay the preseason at this point we play for free
8161123 the biggest way of quickly growing the pie is in the media area the feeling is that we would get greater revenue for media if we had more regular season games
8161124 i couldnt give you what the unions stance is but as a player the idea of adding two more games i assume they factor that in and increase the compensation
8161125 if you work at the gap and they add two more hours to your schedule you would expect to get two more hours worth of pay the preseason at this point we play for free i understand that they think we need it but all in all you only have so many games in your body as a football player
8161126 sixteen regular season games i think is enough but four preseason games is too many

8161128 one of the things the fans love about the 16 game schedule is the importance of one game translates to about 10 games in other sports every game is valuable the more games you add dilutes your product an executive tends to think more is better well more isnt always better
8161129 weve got a good five weeks here for me to rehab and get a good sense of how im recovering and what it looks like
8161130 then i think we will all have a better idea
8161131 als neunj hrige halten sie sich f r die gr te wenn so ein auto vorf hrt
8161132 es gab zeiten in denen ich sicher kein so angenehmer zeitgenosse war
8161133 da ist es egal ob sie meier m ller oder millowitsch hei en wenn sie die fakten nicht draufhaben ist feierabend
8161134 ich kann mich da nur auf die bande zwischen meinen geschwistern beziehen die sind ganz wichtig bedeuten mir viel
8161135 wenn ich kinder gewollt h tte h tte ich sie bekommen
8161136 wir sind zwei menschen die sehr viel arbeiten jeder hat da seinen eigenen rhythmus den er auch leben sollte zumindest unter der woche am wochenende sind wir dann immer zusammen
8161137 thats the only way we make it fair on our scout team is hes got to play with one watch video of eagle valley faith christian football watch video fountain fort carson ralston valley football watch video of thomas jefferson monarch football watch video of first day of fall practice watch highlights of the latest prep action view a gallery of slide shows from prep sports across colorado discuss high school sports and uncover tidbits on the all things colorado preps blog discuss high school sports in a tailor made forum hand in his pocket
8161138 and he was still making plays thats what is dirty
8161139 once im lined up across from that offensive cat im like well now its judgment day
8161140 my first option is to go to college so i can actually avoid struggling like my dad and my mom did i dont want to end up in that situation
8161141 when im out there its like theres a whole new person theres like energy as soon as i get out there ive got to be the generator the motivator we may come out there ready but its my job to push that edge and get everybody ready the crowd involved coaches hyped
8161142 i get the opponents offense scared thats my whole mentality intimidation rules all
8161143 well put him in positions where he wont be thinking too much
8161144 the speed of the college game kind of threw me off at first but i was fine after that
8161145 he does a great job with the mental aspect of the game but he just needs a year in the weight room
8161146 its big for the state its big for cu its big for us
8161147 we should play in denver every year the whole state knows that and hopefully that will happen
8161148 as long as they keep having great players and we keep having great players its always going to be a rivalry people get fired up about this game i think this rivalry is a lot bigger than wins and losses
8161149 regardless of who wins i think the rivalry is the same whether one team is winning it or its even that shouldnt determine what makes a rivalry game or if thats grounds for if it should be renewed or not i just think you have the last four or five years games that are hard fought coming down to the wire between two good teams
8161150 i think close games are plenty enough to keep the rivalry strong
8161151 the games we have won could have swung either way a few plays here and there luckily we were fortunate to come out on top its always close and anytime its close youre going to be biting your nails at the end of games and thats what makes a good rivalry
8161152 if its consistent year after year us blowing them out or them blowing us out then theres no point
8161153 but if you look at the last four games its come down to one play
8161154 but he also had a tilt to his pelvis and some back pain his symptoms were very similar to whiplash
8161155 am i going to get a lot of heat from you guys
8161156 when they bury me are they going to put on my gravestone youre one win ahead of bobby bowden
8161157 i went home and it started to hail real bad i called my mom and she said there was a tornado warning for windsor and sure enough here it comes
8161158 so i grabbed the dogs and went downstairs and just before i knew it there goes the top of the house
8161159 the complete left wall was torn out every room was completely destroyed
8161160 living room furniture was moved around it was amazing how much fury a tornado has
8161161 i really didnt know what was happening when i came up and saw daylight and our curtains and blinds were closed i was pretty shocked
8161162 were very fortunate right now that we have all of our guys intact
8161163 it makes you think about life there are a lot bigger things going on than football
8161164 you drive through that area and there are people who dont have much done on their homes i dont know how long it will take to get back to normal because theres so much debris and wreckage and stuff out there that will remind people of this tornado for years
8161165 you dont fully understand the impact of a tornado actually until you go to the scene itself ive seen footage but its nothing until you go out and see it firsthand
8161166 the community has definitely been behind us and weve been behind the community
8161167 i think it will be hopefully a high point for us
8161168 obviously wed like to win but wed like to see more people recover this is their home now its like theyre on a vacation
8161169 due to the unprecedented demand our inventories have been depleted
8161170 we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
8161171 urging lenders and trading partners to stick by an embattled firm also carries the risk that it will inflame the same anxieties that the fed is trying to soothe that is one reason why such calls occur rarely
8161172 that is something obviously we will be taking a look at
8161173 but i dont think the problem with fannie and freddie is just confined to banks that happen to hold their preferred stock
8161174 these are the sort of moments that give you opportunities
8161175 we are still of the view stubborn as we are that we have not seen the end of the problems and therefore financials have not made a relative bottom
8161176 they used to stop trading when it was clear that there were some people who knew what was going on and others dont
8161177 our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes
8161178 reduce future defaults improve the value of the mortgages and cut servicing costs
8161179 we expect third quarter results will be hampered by declining global equity markets further deterioration in mortgage assets and slower levels of corporate and institutional activity
8161180 is still a few quarters away as we anticipate additional asset sales and write downs in coming quarters throughout the financial services sector
8161181 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
8161182 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese living on the border with us
8161183 los caminos de la vida son pesados y largos por eso es mejor marchar sobre ellos con el alma liviana con la conciencia ligera y el coraz n libre de sobrecargas
8161184 after 27 years of public service its time for me to enjoy life
8161185 to this end the group is engaged in constructive dialogue and is not aware of any issues which would prevent thise amendments being finalised by the end of this year
8161186 while conditions are likely to remain tough in both the uk and the us in the short term we are maintaining momentum in the uk and we have seen pockets of stabilisation in the us
8161187 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8161188 my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8161189 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8161190 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8161191 promises more of the same a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real strategy to invest in our crumbling infrastructure
8161192 but im going to be out there rooting for obama
8161193 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8161194 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver
8161195 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8161196 we know how were going to leave here but its still important that women have made this progress if were disenfranchised from casting a vote for hillary clinton it will be very difficult to feel a part of a unified process
8161197 a coherent consistent narrative of who he is that weaves together the themes of his campaign with his life history
8161198 that is why i love this country ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
8161199 look after mommy and ill see you guys on thursday all right
8161200 maar let wel er zijn meerdere kandidaten er staan tussen de acht en tien spelers op ons lijstje
8161201 were not afraid of anything of the prospect of a cold war
8161202 of course we dont want that in this situation everything depends on the stand of the world community and our partners in the west
8161203 but if they choose a confrontational scenario we will be responsive
8161204 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8161205 of course this raises some questions because normally battleships do not deliver aid and if it is a battleship diplomacy or rather battleship humanitarian diplomacy of course it does not make the situation more stable
8161206 but this is the choice of those who deliver aid
8161207 this is like a bullfight in spain when someone sticks a knife in the bull and it is bleeding and people are waiting for the bull to die
8161208 durch die reduktion der emissionen haben die chinesen ein riesiges nat rliches laboratorium geschaffen in dem sich herausfinden l sst wie luftverschmutzung das klima beeinflusst
8161209 wir wollen sehen welchen globalen einfluss diese eine stadt hat
8161210 we are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
8161211 i dont think this is the last word yet a lot depends on how far apart they actually are on an agreement on verification
8161212 all that was agreed upon at the present phase was to set up verification and monitoring mechanisms
8161213 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8161214 the team trusts me totally i get everything that i want and need and that is the right way to make progress
8161215 but that doesnt bother me i know what i can do and what i want to achieve
8161216 nervous and absent minded raikkonen is in a deep crisis
8161217 there is absolutely nothing to link hari puttar with harry potter
8161218 even if it does rhyme with harry potter surely there is a limit to cases
8161219 however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
8161220 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session
8161221 we sent out a press release one day saying we were on the verge of closing it down and the next day we had 500 000
8161222 they shine the light on the real emergencies and step up where we really need help
8161223 for me the whole goal is to stay relevant as long as i can
8161224 i feel my eyes have received a big boon after seeing you all for me standing at the feet of lord venkateshwara in tirupathi
8161225 the peoples call is the energy for me abdul kalam said that i should come into politics to serve people he told me to work with determination and carry on a mission with vision oriented goal he told me to go in your path by extending your helping hand just ignore who ever try to clutch you and hinder you
8161226 even the big ocean started with a drop in my mega journey im the first step and harbinger
8161227 the primary mission right now is the maritime boundary line with russia keeping foreigners from stealing alaskan fish

8161233 eine technische reaktion kann bis ungef hr 14 00 us dollar unze verlaufen wo silber aus charttechnischer sicht ein trading short ist
8161234 auch bei silber sehen wir voraussichtlich noch immer keinen boden mittelfristig besteht die gefahr einer korrekturausdehnung in richtung 10 xx us dollar unze
8161235 ich sehe das nicht als das ende des bullenmarktes an
8161236 bis nicht entweder eine menge angebot an den markt kommt oder die wirtschaft zusammenbricht wird der bullenmarkt andauern
8161237 we are gathering not in a sense of celebrating but as a way of saying that from today we will be building our peace and we will have our dignity and our happiness which is what i believe the supreme court above all cares about the peace and happiness of the community which they havent had for a long time because there are still invasions of our land
8161238 the difference between writing a book and being on television is the difference between conceiving a child and having a baby made in a test tube
8161239 you have it in your power to make your days on earth a path of flowers instead of a path of thorns

8161241 its good composition its a strong story its literate and the audiences get it and really like it
8161242 bragging rights are nice but its nice for our audience to say theyre the first audience in canada to be able to see this work its not about the company doing it first
8161243 as soon as you get into that too much emotionally youre doomed because then youre not paying attention to whats right for your audience and your community ive seen colleagues over the years get all excited about what they were doing and how it was enhancing their international reputation and pretty soon they didnt have a job
8161244 lots of times were asked isnt this going to make your long term subscribers upset
8161245 not at all long term operagoers are the ones who want to see something new theyve seen nine boh me s they really welcome good newer work
8161246 when you only do three or four productions a year four in our case if you are not thoughtful about how and when you do this work you can really get a company in trouble

8161249 that kind of gave him a spark for the films
8161250 hes one of those filmmakers who wants to be a musician and i think that the way his films are trying to capture little fresh moments is a cool approach
8161251 its very important to me to not let the musician try to make the song perfect
8161252 its so much more human when a musician is doing this beautiful version of a song but messes up and then continues yeah thats beautiful to me
8161253 as far as the modern world is concerned these are natural environments
8161254 its filmed in its own elements from where it came from the streets and the bars and peoples apartments
8161255 lets put the final nail in the coffin on the term music video and allow it to be something of the past because thats exactly what it is
8161256 it served its purpose very well in the 1980s and 1990s music videos time came and went
8161257 i dont think music or film has been in a more exciting place in 20 years
8161258 i was just blown away by their beauty and how raw they were
8161259 we were just getting a little bit bored of watching the music promos
8161260 we didnt have much clout or really any money so the idea was to try to find a way to get our vision out there and get people to buy into it
8161261 a significant shift in the way people are watching music film

8161263 it means diabetic wounds can be actually healed rather than just offering palliative care it could mean fewer amputations which are often necessary when these wounds wont heal
8161264 the cost of non healing wounds would be up in the hundreds of millions of dollars
8161265 the bank had always abided by rules set by related industry supervisors and regulators in china and abroad and its internal anti money laundering and anti terrorist policies also ban financial services for terrorist organisations

8161270 we have a year long training programme for young farmers we enrol 25 applicants in each batch and make them undergo a total training programme
8161271 farmers from around 100 villages are being covered by the kvk and they grow vegetables in an area of over 1 000 hectares
8161272 even using the most optimistic forecasts for levels of domestic graduates and of migration into australia it skills shortages will continue or get worse at least until 2012
8161273 this is a worrying trend considering the strategic importance of it sector to the australian economy according to 2006 data from the australian bureau of statistics it is one of the main contributors to productivity gains in all sectors of the australian economy
8161274 not only does the arts and cultural industry make a valuable economic contribution in its own right it also stimulates creative activity in other sectors of the economy
8161275 countries around the world as well as many cities and regions recognise that a dynamic culture sector plays a key role as a magnet for talent enhances economic output and acts as a catalyst for prosperity
8161276 opportunities for growth in the culture sector are being driven by digital technologies and exploding use of the internet these technologies allow content producers to distribute their works to a wide audience and consumers to participate directly in creating cultural content

8161282 if you reduce uric acid you may be able to reduce blood pressure bp this could be one way people develop hypertension and may allow us to develop new therapies
8161283 this is far from being a reasonable therapeutic intervention for hbp but these findings indicate a first step in understanding the pathway of the disease
8161284 you cannot prevent a disease until you know the cause this study is a way of finding that out
8161285 in my view if don bradman was playing today he would still have an average as twice as good as any other batsman in the world
8161286 with the advances in bat technology and training imagine how good don would be today it would be scary he is by far and away the best batsman ever and would still be today
8161287 its almost like hes separate from the game his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach
8161288 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
8161289 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
8161290 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
8161291 we conclude that the magnetic field is the only common and most likely factor responsible for the observed alignment
8161292 meticulous use of water and how to preserve the natures most precious gift is a thrust area for us
8161293 it is our corporate social responsibility to help farmers to opt for drip irrigation and ensure optimum utilisation of water
8161294 kvk chomu has proved a boon for the areas vegetable and fruit growers you find a host of inquisitive visitors to the centre every day

8161298 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8161299 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8161300 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8161301 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8161302 i cant walk out to the bird feeder without having my legs completely covered with them
8161303 i was talking to my sister districts and theyre all scrambling too trying to catch up with these things hopefully by the weekend it will be better i wont say theyll be gone but hopefully theyll be better
8161304 im very happy because just to be here and to be able to compete for me its already a great achievement
8161305 im just so thrilled to have the opportunity to play because after the olympics it was obviously very disappointing since montreal i havent had the chance to practice i only started practicing last monday
8161306 after beijing i thought i might not be able to compete here and i really tried to do everything possible for my recovery
8161307 im a very big competitor so obviously i want myself to win but i think at the moment its a lot to ask for i just want to take it match by match
8161308 this match is definitely going to help me because it was very challenging i was sad i was 4 2 up and had a couple break points and everything was looking fine i just dropped my concentration for a moment and then it was very hard for me to get back into the game so definitely a match like is going to help me in the next rounds obviously i was missing a lot of my match practice so i got a tough one today
8161309 were getting ready to play one so thats not a fair question
8161310 throughout the country i think its been obvious to everybody in a lot of situations sometimes youre left without a game because somebody pulls out or changes the contract on you and things need to be adjusted and theres not a lot of people always willing to go play you
8161311 my plans are to be a board member that is very interactive at the actual school building level and begins an immediate cooperation with all teachers
8161312 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8161313 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8161314 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8161315 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8161316 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8161317 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there
8161318 part of the roof was knocked off and it landed on braniff road and knocked down some power lines
8161319 the economic health of galveston is pretty sturdy but we have a sense that people are more pinched by the cost of food and fuel
8161320 we want people to recognize what it has done in the past to touch the community
8161321 were convinced people will see these good things happening around them and be willing to come back this year to support the campaign
8161322 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8161323 i told them that i was committed to new york city opera and signed my contract
8161324 nobody knows at the moment what will happen anyway with their six week season plus rehearsals period the bayreuth festival should not affect my work for nyco on the contrary it could reinforce the international stature of city opera
8161325 a monumental contribution and captured the mood and spirit of a whole generation in their reflections and attitudes
8161326 if there is any humanity and empathy in my work which i think there is i would rather owe it to her
8161327 what scraps of credibility abdullah had left after march 8 are gone
8161328 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8161329 so that abdullah will realize that his leadership is no longer wanted
8161330 with anwar ibrahim in parliament we cannot afford to have a weak leadership because it could lead to our downfall
8161331 the walls are crumbling but the top guy seems oblivious to his surroundings

8161334 right now we are still apart on a lot of issues
8161335 they conjure up boogeyman issues they know will incite the membership then at the last minute they pull them off the table
8161336 yeah there was this guy in my network who added me i thought he looked ok but his updates were really cramping my news feed so i had to deface him
8161337 i went on a date with a girl i met a week before and like the day after our date she changed her status to in a relationship i defaced her

8161341 the population is getting older and older people have higher incomes
8161342 we have an immigrant population that is settling in and that is raising their incomes
8161343 it took six years for low and middle income californians to regain ground lost from the 2001 recession but those gains were too little too late
8161344 we have families renting and living in unfinished garages for 500 to 600 a month and even thats a huge chunk of their income let alone the increased cost of food and
8161345 im working a lot more and making a lot less
8161346 a bright moment that has a dark lining to it
8161347 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus and the department has begun this assessment
8161348 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8161349 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8161350 do we want four more years of bush mccain or do we want the change we need
8161351 there is only one candidate from the middle class that understands the middle class
8161352 george bush has put the middle class in a hole and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8161353 if you think the last eight years have been good you need to vote for john mccain
8161354 we cant simply drill our way to energy independence if you drilled everywhere if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has
8161355 its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8161356 or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8161357 those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8161358 the decision not to go to poti was based on operational considerations including our own lack of knowledge of conditions at the port after the russians took it over
8161359 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of the people
8161360 we are reviewing our relationship with russia europe is reviewing its relationship with russia
8161361 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8161362 if you ask those former clinton voters who they want to be for barack obama or john mccain they would say barack obama overwhelmingly
8161363 were all worried because we should as a party be doing better
8161364 i am so freaking proud of her i cant stand it she is the leader of my life but she just gave me my marching orders barack won the election
8161365 there is no sense that the party has a sense of urgency
8161366 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual but its a lousy soundbite
8161367 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis
8161368 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8161369 if john mccain has his way your bills will continue to grow and your paycheck will continue to shrink
8161370 in an obama biden administration american families will finally get a new deal for a new economy a tax cut they earned healthcare they can afford a pension they can keep and a college education they deserve
8161371 the convention is about getting american voters particularly swing voters to know barack obama and become comfortable with him
8161372 provide an anchor of objectivity in an investment world populated by those more interested in rewards than in uncovering systemic risks
8161373 is a complete farce and runs in the face of pure capitalism
8161374 creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way
8161375 we have an enormous opportunity to create real energy independence for the uk freeing ourselves from the shackles of foreign oil coal and gas this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
8161376 i am delighted that nick clegg is calling for a green revolution in the way we produce power
8161377 the recent russian invasion of georgia and the ongoing troubles in iraq and iran show just how dangerously reliant britain is on energy from unstable parts of the world
8161378 we have to build up our own energy supplies and as an island nation we have an abundance of natural and clean energy sources that both labour and conservative governments have failed to develop
8161379 whilst labour and the conservatives joined together earlier this year to agree britain should have a new generation of nuclear power stations liberal democrats believe this will leave a legacy of radioactive waste for future generations
8161380 liberal democrats in hastings amp rye welcome nick cleggs call for britain to develop clean energy supplies and become self sufficient in them by 2050 this is an industry in which we as a nation should aim to be world beaters

8161387 creo que es una cortina de humo para ocultar cu l es el fondo del conflicto l encontr muy rentable personalizar en ra l padilla un conflicto cuando el conflicto no es con ra l padilla cuando el problema es con rganos de gobierno y de representaci n diversas en la universidad a las cuales no les ha querido reconocer una serie de atribuciones y cuyas atribuciones por momentos ha querido usurpar
8161388 la aprobaci n del presupuesto y la definici n de montos y reglas de operaci n es atribuci n de cuerpos de gobierno no de la autoridad unipersonal

8161391 ra l no es la universidad no podr a serlo que haya universitarios que concuerdan con las opiniones que l pudiera verter sobre los que l tiene en buena lid una influencia bueno finalmente todo el mundo es adulto y toma sus propias decisiones pero eso ocurre donde sea
8161392 hace unos meses este hombre se refer a a ra l padilla como mi mentor mi jefe pol tico casi mi padre de una manera lacayuna y servil
8161393 qu credibilidad tendr a cualquier persona que durante 20 a os se signific por ser el m s constante el m s asiduo y el m s grande adulador de ra l padilla muchos lo han tachado de servil se desviv a siempre en ese tipo de actitudes y de pronto descubre que es ra l padilla alguien que le ha hecho mucho da o a la universidad me parece triste y lamentable que a esa edad asuma esas actitudes y haga ese papel sumamente indigno
8161394 me he dado cuenta del da o enorme que ra l padilla le ha hecho a la udeg al desviar a la instituci n de sus nobles prop sitos de formar j venes
8161395 me he dado cuenta quiz s un poco tarde por eso pido sic disculpas

8161409 lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water
8161410 look then of course peter does look and realizes he is actually walking on water
8161411 el rector persiste en una actitud que lo ha confrontado con los rganos de gobierno de toda la red universitaria en su af n de imponer un estilo unipersonal y autoritario de conducci n y de gesti n
8161412 se on paikka jossa edistykselliset hallitukset voivat kehitt vaihtoehtoa kapitalismille
8161413 das gilt auch f r baden w rttemberg und bayern
8161414 wenn der mann noch lange im amt ist dann verstehe ich nicht mehr warum man das beamtentum braucht
8161415 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
8161416 do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others
8161417 allez ch rie on sen va maintenant on doit aller voir ta m re
8161418 people who are balanced and happy do great work the first hour of each day is an investment in the quality of the work it sets the tone for the rest of the day and the good will created carries into each piece of jewelry and ultimately to the wearer this creates a product that not only looks great but it has spiritual integrity as well i think consumers really care about that sort of thing these days you must walk your talk to be taken seriously
8161419 within two years you just bring it back and we give you another one
8161420 eeew youre making them out of potatoes thats gross nana im not eating any
8161421 the bullet was leaving the barrel just fine the trouble must have been at the other end

8161425 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus and the department has begun this assessment
8161426 i always hated japan and ive come to hate it more these days
8161427 i explode with anger whenever they say its their territory
8161428 japans past wrongdoing and its colonial rule are condensed in these tiny islets
8161429 japan is of the view that both sides should respond calmly to this issue recognizing the differences in positions between our countries as differences in positions
8161430 should fire the head of the national police agency to show his sincerity
8161431 save your lives and reach relief camps and other safe places there is very little time to escape the death and destruction
8161432 tanto appena successo mica pu capitare un altro disastro in cos poco tempo
8161433 i understand that i am all over the map in this discourse for i have so many ideas and conflicting views flowing in my head and i must reconcile them do you understand no one understands no one ever seems to understand i feel like i am insane when i speak these things at least an enlightened christian understands another enlightened christian who is it i have not but my beating heart
8161434 cuando se trata de la gesti n de la demanda de electricidad peque os cambios que suponen importantes beneficios se incorporan r pidamente
8161435 por ello es muy positivo ver que fujitsu siemens computers ha creado un monitor que no consume nada de energ a cuando no se est utilizando
8161436 con la introducci n de estos dos nuevos monitores fujitsu siemens computers est haciendo algo m s que s lo hablar de green it est ofreciendo productos verdaderamente m s verdes que cualquier otro monitor en el mercado en modo standby y en funcionamiento y a un precio asequible
8161437 el gran n mero de solicitudes de ordenes de compra para esta gama de monitores demuestra que existe una importante demanda p blica de productos it que sean verdaderamente respetuosos con el medioambiente
8161438 la incre ble respuesta del consumidor nos inspira para continuar desarrollando nuevos productos bajo la filosof a green it
8161439 i think its extremely highly probable and im not a democratic pollster
8161440 the undercurrent is that people feel theyre ready for change
8161441 the rhetoric theyve been handed for too long has not helped at all
8161442 there is a very strong possibility that the committee will be unable to complete its investigation before congress expires that may leave important public concerns regarding the nations federal criminal justice system unaddressed
8161443 we do the same thing the vikings and just about everybody else does
8161444 we can ask for plays from the right hash in the fourth quarter when theres a full moon any variable you want
8161445 even in the summer when were hanging out with our football friends well take out some football film and well end up watching that just to see what we did last year and what we can improve on
8161446 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
8161447 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
8161448 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
8161449 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
8161450 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
8161451 boy that guy is doing a pretty good job of sounding like glen phillips
8161452 that guy used to be the lead singer of this band toad the
8161453 you know it isnt even about the money it was the thrill of killing someone
8161454 existing law relating to local land use planning and group residences to revise terms to clarify supervision requirements to eliminate restrictions on local governments to regulate group residences which are zoned as single family dwellings when tenancy in such homes is by persons under supervision of the state board of correction pursuant to law by persons required to register pursuant to law or by other persons posing a direct threat of harm
8161455 there was a failure of the master to exercise extraordinary diligence and good seamanship thereby committing an error of judgment
8161456 the board said that this aspect of the investigation shall be turned over to government investigative bodies and agencies
8161457 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8161458 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8161459 proud supporter of obama clinton dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8161460 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8161461 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8161462 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8161463 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8161464 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8161465 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8161466 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8161467 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8161468 confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8161469 failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8161470 barack obama has called for strong american leadership and renewing strong alliances to finish the fight against al qaida and press russia to live up to its obligations
8161471 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny
8161472 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8161473 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8161474 if youre so rich like me you cant even recall how many houses you own if you love the bush tax cuts because it means you get to invest more of the money youll never use while most of the country goes without food heat and medical care and if you want to reward me after totally failing to do my job as a senator for an entire year vote for me
8161475 it will be my druthers that they make the tough decision
8161476 theres got to be buy in from kingman to show low to safford to tucson to phoenix and all the way in between
8161477 this was the wrong plan at the wrong time and now the debate over transportation funding can take place where it should at the legislature
8161478 there are other materials that give better performance or have higher energy densities
8161479 but were willing to sacrifice a little power to keep the ecosystem happy
8161480 if you looked down at the grid it wouldnt look that different from seaweed
8161481 harvesting energy from rivers ocean waves and currents are going to be an important segment of our overall energy generation in the future
8161482 the one place that they spend a lot of time that theyre not connected is in their vehicle and we want to bring that to them
8161483 where do i want us to improve everywhere i want a massive improvement ive been really disappointed with our performances this season and i have told the players that i think we need to improve in every area in the second leg we were lucky to leave belgium with a 0 0 when you see the goal that wasnt given and the penalty it could have been worse and we were not a threat at all but the positive is that it can be a wake up call the players must understand what a massive game this is
8161484 i can confirm im joining tottenham right now im getting my visa and as soon as it is ready i will fly to england to sign a contract i wont play in kiev everything has happened very quickly so i couldnt even say goodbye to my team mates i could not decide if i wanted to go to england at first first yes then no the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham and the formalities are practically settled
8161485 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain
8161486 this was all known and quite predictable when the clubs then owners recommended thaksin shinawatra and accepted his money with their eyes wide open
8161487 shaun wright phillips departure to either manchester city or everton
8161488 kaka is a devout christian who does not approve of ronaldinhos notoriously hedonistic lifestyle and is concerned with the direction milan are taking
8161489 ronaldinho became so besotted with a swedish footballer that he proposed within hours of meeting her at the beijing olympics she claims
8161490 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities its not only the weather that im not happy about here in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8161491 cook has acknowledged that currently thaksin is not providing funds for the club last month city took out a 25m loan facility with standard bank secured on the clubs premier league tv money this season and in 2009 10 to cover cash shortfalls however cook has denied reports that the latest wardle loan was made to pay citys wages the wages are paid automatically every month a spokesman explained and the club borrowed 2m from wardle to pay blackburn rovers part of the compensation package after mark hughes joined city as manager
8161492 nobody at city then wanted to talk about thaksins difficulties wardle offered no public explanation of his reasoning the official line was that the corruption charges were being brought under a military government and so had no validity within days sven goran eriksson was the manager elano martin petrov and vedran corluka were signed city won their first three games including a 1 0 victory over manchester united and the sun shone at eastlands if it seems bizarre that manchester city the club of bert trautmann colin bell and blue moon is owned by a fugitive former thai prime minister facing corruption charges and seizure of assets it is more bizarre still that this was all known and quite predictable when the clubs then owners recommended him and accepted his money with their eyes wide open
8161493 city are trying to land brazilian world cup winner ronaldo
8161494 real had a 47m bid for villa turned down on sunday but will up that to 50m the valencia president vicente soriano had promised he would not sell but his club is crippled by debts of over 250m and the board is encouraging him to cave in cazorla should be a simpler matter as the midfielder has a buy out clause of around 12m robinhos arrival at stamford bridge is likely to prompt shaun wright phillips departure to either manchester city or everton
8161495 chelsea will make one last attempt to sign kaka from ac milan in a recordbreaking 80million deal before the transfer window closes on monday night
8161496 the world player of the year has been left stunned by a transfer policy that has seen carlo ancelotti recruit players like the ukrainian striker and arsenals philippe senderos but is even more unhappy with the arrival of ronaldinho kaka is a devout christian who does not approve of ronaldinhos notoriously hedonistic lifestyle and is concerned with the direction milan are taking
8161497 ronaldinho became so besotted with a swedish footballer that he proposed within hours of meeting her at the beijing olympics she claims
8161498 given that the 8 million fee is 1 5 million lower than a deal that espanyol agreed with everton the signing may be claimed as a personal triumph for parry whose negotiating skills have been questioned by ben tez the manager on the other hand will be happy to get the player he wanted after the embarrassing barry saga having been urged by the clubs hierarchy to consider stewart downing the middlesbrough and england winger as an alternative
8161499 contract talks at upton park with the 23 year old defender broke down irretrievably earlier this month with sources at west ham citing his excessive wage demands more than double his present deal as the primary reason for the collapse it was pointed out to ferdinand that he was not a first team regular given his injury record and the competition at the club and was not in a position to make such demands nevertheless west ham had offered ferdinand around 35 000 a week which in itself represented a significant hike in his present wages
8161500 it is an attitude that looks increasingly naive as arsenals rivals pay big money for star players insularity in the face of stiff competition is hardly a recommended business practice but wenger maintains that he can fight the power of chelsea and manchester united by adhering to his principles and playing his own game
8161501 this option is theoretically also open to berbatov next year with the expectation that he would have to fund the balance of his contract as compensation if that happened tottenham would only receive around 2 5 million spurs though would inevitably fight such a move and believe that a player can only invoke the ruling if he could also show that he had not contributed to his situation tottenham also believe that berbatov would be restricted to moving to a club abroad although he could potentially then be loaned back to an english club
8161502 comebacks from such setbacks are never easy but freed from the burden of the gargantuan fee and embraced by colleagues more sympathetic to his style i hope and suspect that his talent has not eroded so definitively to preclude a thrilling second coming
8161503 serie a now looks a long way short of the premier league individual clubs will remain a force at european level particularly now that jose mourinho has pitched up in the dug out at inter milan but the league is no longer anything like as exotic or as appealing as the premier league or la liga world cup winners though they may be italian football badly needs a pick me up and it remains to be seen whether shevchenko and ronaldinho or for that matter senderos bianchi or john arne riise can provide it
8161504 where does italy rank in europe today its national team is world champion though after a summer of failure it has gone back to rehire the 2006 coach marcello lippi its league is behind england in popularity behind spain in quality and some way behind germany in terms of financial regulation serie a indeed is still trying to deal with its past the days of the italian business barons ruling european soccer are gone and the memories of match fixing linger on juventus and ac milan deserved to suffer for their parts in that corruption and inter consolidated with the title in both the last two seasons
8161505 italys top flight clubs have opened their wallets and invested 310m in new players the most since 2001 thats 100m more than la ligas teams and 15m less than the premierships sides while flashing the cash doesnt necessarily guarantee success it indicates aspiration and a desire for improvement that will ultimately strengthen the championship for the benefit of us all even serie as harshest of critics have to admit its on the up four of the last five ballon dor winners play or have played in italy new stadia have been commissioned in turin and cagliari and tv rights are to be collectively bargained for in 2010 so lets revel in watching serie a re emerge
8161506 triesman not having a football background despite his allegiance to tottenham hotspur misses one very important factor that this fine talk of strategy of cunning plans and political long games goes straight out of the window if england lose in croatia next month or in any match of significance between now and the world cup final on july 11 2010 at which point batten down the hatches the only strategy that matters to the country is the one fabio capello the present manager will deploy to avoid embarrassment at the qualifying stage everything else is chatter if the football is not right no other facet of the organisation is considered important
8161507 we need a large element of their wages to be performance related and on top of that if youre injured your money must be cut radically players can easily insure their income to cover themselves for periods of lay off it should not be a burden the club has to bear players expect win bonuses but not loss reductions why not thats just having your cake and cramming it in your gob son performance related pay could work like this an independent panel of ex footballers and managers assess every players performance each game and puts it into one of three bands great average and bad with bad reducing income by two thirds if youre not picked you earn 50 less than a contractual median if youre injured you get nothing and take out personal insurance
8161508 im pretty sure he wouldnt like whats going on in the game now with fitness coaches taking over and prozones weights dieticians pasta and bananas but he would survive today definitely brian clough would have adapted and made his mark at whatever club he was at because he knew his football and i think the modern day player would be able to put up with him players would love to play for him because he was different
8161509 the minister for sport gerry sutcliffe mp comes out in favour saying being a passionate brit and passionately english scottish welsh or irish are not mutually exclusive
8161510 they will face tougher opponents than cottbus and gladbach soon but their two wins have put them firmly on the map theyve played highly organised direct attacking football with a young team whose oldest player defender per nilsson is 25 hoffenheim are part of the establishment now wrote s ddeutsche zeitung the days of making fun of dreary village life and camera teams swooping on customers in the local butchers and bakers are over the problem is not everybody sees it that way the vitriol from the travelling borussia supporters they called hopp a son of a whore and worse took even the battle hardened 68 year old by surprise i will only travel to away matches where my safety will be guaranteed he said on monday after accepting an apology from gladbachs president
8161511 while barca have concentrated on rebuilding their squad and team morale real appear to have been distracted by their fruitless summer romance with cristiano ronaldo the champions have reinforced their squad with just one recruit dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart from hamburg however unless they make a late swoop for a new striker they look short staffed up front and dangerously over reliant on ruud van nistelrooy and raul for goals
8161512 are pavlyuchenko robinho amp ronaldo heading to the premier league while vidic looks set to jump ship
8161513 i love you i love you i love you i love you

8161518 she did what she had to do and she did it in her usual spectacular fashion
8161519 taking a gamble that obama cant win without women over the age of 40
8161520 an age joke about mccain is at this point somewhat meaningless because its already trite
8161521 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it

8161524 we want to be vested in our clients success and failures charging a management fee for non performance doesnt seem a win win situation a manager should not be compensated for not producing an absolute return and by that i mean a positive return no matter what the market environment holds martin asset management charges a 10 performance fee with a high water mark for its separate managed accounts with no annual management fee some critics argue that such a setup will ultimately lead to greater risk taking in order to produce positive numbers i would argue that a performance fee with the high water mark will ensure that the contrary will happen when a manager gets compensated for actual positive returns he or she will treat the clients assets as if they were trading their own accounts and that is a fact

8161755 if were managing coral reefs we need to integrate that management with the surrounding forests
8161756 reefs with islands on them should be targeted by reef management because they become places that people use and theres usually a limited land area on islands which quite often is modified

8161777 what will be extraordinary about this will be the impacts it will achieve in terms of traffic congestion relief economic development and jobs and the obvious environmental impacts it will have
8161778 this reflects a view that if you have money you get to go in the fast lane and if you dont you are stuck in congestion
8161779 the overall goal of the program is to improve the movement of everybody in the corridor
8161780 in other parts of the country where this has been tried there has been a significant difference in congestion
8161781 the population is getting older and older people have higher incomes
8161782 we have an immigrant population that is settling in and that is raising their incomes
8161783 it took six years for low and middle income californians to regain ground lost from the 2001 recession but those gains were too little too late
8161784 we have families renting and living in unfinished garages for 500 to 600 a month and even thats a huge chunk of their income let alone the increased cost of food and

8161797 it seemed like once that other crime increased with break ins of cars and break ins of houses once that crime increased it seemed like other ones came with it

8161799 the impact of a crime like that someone who targets the elderly is that it can create hysteria at times

8161840 this latest research confirms we have a serious problem of self harm in the uk particularly among women
8161841 what we normally do is look at three year rolling averages
8161842 when we compare the suicide rates between 2000 and 2002 with those in 2005 and 2007 there is an overall decrease
8161843 nobody ever likes to see an increase obviously but we cannot focus on one year because it may be a blip rather than a trend

8161848 weve taken prudent steps in respect of monitoring ourmortgage portfolio but we are not seeing any signs of stress
8161849 we wanted to make sure that we were determining impairment on the job but at the same time protecting private rights
8161850 we decided to test current impairment to do the job not whether or not someone does drugs or not we dont want to pry into peoples private life
8161851 an investigation takes place and if it is determined that drugs or alcohol are involved there will be a test
8161852 the same applies if there is a near miss on the job or an occurrence that could lead to a serious injury or significant loss of property
8161853 its all about helping a worker rehabilitate herself or himself and get back to being a productive worker
8161854 if someone has a drug problem and they are addicted we have a rehabilitation program for them especially when we look at recurrences we may be looking at someone who needs help and help will be offered
8161855 but the real definitive step towards work safety would be pre employment testing pre employment testing is better than post accident or near miss testing
8161856 our work with the government of saskatchewan will ensure that foreign workers continue to enjoy the same rights and protections as canadian workers
8161857 i am pleased that both governments are developing new and improved publications in several different languages some of which are already available at local service canada centres and online we are also working together on outreach activities to ensure that not only workers know their rights but also that employers know their responsibilities when hiring a foreign worker in saskatchewan and across canada
8161858 we do have a concern with the increased use of the temporary foreign worker program without ensuring the legislative framework that covers workers rights is available to temporary foreign workers
8161859 we have no indication that the provincial government is serious about this at all we are skeptical about the government in relation to workers rights
8161860 the federation of labour and our affiliates are all supportive of a proactive immigration policy which involves full rights of citizenship
8161861 we are supportive of a respectful and aggressive immigration policy that encourages citizens from outside countries to come to saskatchewan to live work and raise a family
8161862 saskatchewan has one of the nations fastest growing economies right now
8161863 the changes we are announcing today will help to address skills shortages in the hospitality sector and to ensure the protection of temporary foreign workers who play such a vital role in this and other industries were pleased to work with the federal government and our industry partners on meeting saskatchewans growing labour market needs
8161864 we have a large and growing aboriginal population in the province which is not fully engaged in the workforce
8161865 efforts need to be doubled and re doubled to ensure this segment of the population fully participates in the economy we might be better served to invest these dollars to make sure saskatchewan citizens are involved in the workforce
8161866 wood is always a beautiful material and it adds a lot of life to any building you use it in
8161867 we wanted to build a building that was both sustainable and beautiful one that did not look like a series of things had been attached to it to fulfil some sustainable objective
8161868 integration of the wood into the structure is an inherently sustainable move that wood can some time in the future be taken down and reused
8161869 the image that when a tree is taken down it is no longer a renewable resource is really a misunderstanding the wood in this building is full of sequestered carbon and that cant be said for the steel or the concrete
8161870 every product thats in the store has an incredible amount of marketing material related to it but when you go to the wood area its called lumber and thats all they are told

8161875 in the old days three to four years ago it would cost 850 900 todays bill is 1500 out of which the fuel surcharge is 28 per cent or about 330 on top of this there are other ferry charges which are probably another 200
8161876 for the company i work for acutemp refrigeration and air conditioning ltd the impact of ferry price increase has been quite significant
8161877 we have noticed an increase in costs because of the size and weight of the material we use everything is trucked by ferry
8161878 we have seen a steady increase in our material costs and in the cost of doing business
8161879 with the price of gas labour and commodities such as copper rising it can be hard to pick up the impact of an increase in the cost of shipping there has been very little reaction to the ferry price increases because it is buried in the overall increase in the cost of living
8161880 we place orders everyday and need equipment delivered right away
8161881 so we have to use the ferry and trucking system in our case it is not viable to use an alternative such as the barge the barge service is not frequent enough and we need materials delivered right to the site
8161882 being an island we are faced with trucking and shipping everything we have
8161883 a lot of lumber windows and drywall go by truck on the ferry to vancouver island this translates into material cost increases and makes it more challenging to attract and retain people

8162046 after being kept apart for those few hours where we missed each other so much we were both very emotional when we saw each other for the first time at the altar we wanted to hug and kiss each other hello but had to go through the ceremony before we could do that
8162047 we got quotes from caterers that were about half the price of what we ended up paying
8162048 youd be surprised how easy it is to suck that many calories through a straw without realizing it
8162049 it would be great if we could just get the facts and not scare tactics to mold the reader to the writers left leaning opinions
8162050 so we just do nothing or do we put windmills on the brooklyn bridge and the statue of liberty sure the oil companies will benefit but thats what they are in business to do in the end we will all benefit by going after those resources that belong to us

8162060 il pilota ha riferito al capo dellaeroporto che i dirottatori non chiedono di negoziare ma chiedono solo che gli sia dato abbastanza carburante per raggiungere parigi
8162061 i dirottatori hanno rifiutato lofferta di supporto medico per una persona che era svenuta a bordo a causa della mancanza di aria condizionata
8162062 dicono di essere con abdel wahed nur un membro del slm che vive a parigi si sarebbero accordati con lui per incontrarsi nella capitale francese
8162063 non abbiamo partecipato a questo dirottamento e completamente contro i nostri obiettivi condanniamo energicamente questo dirottamento

8162068 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8162069 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8162070 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president

8162073 but i know where we are and where we have to go im ready

8162077 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8162078 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8162079 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8162080 here is a man who has done 99 great things in his life but hes only being remembered lately for one mistake hes made

8162083 first off its a new version of our anti virus engine its much more effective its a lot faster and rather than rely on just exact signature matches the way its traditionally done this new engine recognized malware based on more general characteristics and can choose the most appropriate antidote so its a lot smarter the other thing that people are talking a lot about these days is white listing historically traditional anti virus products use signature files or blacklists if you will to determine whats bad well white listing which were incorporating into this new version is all about determining whats known to be good on a computer
8162084 and no were not going to come after you and ask you to take it off your facebook or myspace page

8162087 get stuck in some series playing a certain type and if theyre doing that two years later they havent had a chance to try different things and if you go from picture to picture youre almost forced to do that
8162088 you had to become very open in your brain in your thinking so there was nothing in your sense of who you are that you objected to im sitting here talking to you and if i saw little slivers of my movies i would remember that i was a hairdresser a boxer a female impersonator a viking a trapeze artist
8162089 i had to mentally psych myself so that when i put on those clothes that wardrobe i believed it and everybody else started to believe it

8162103 we have had customers move from firstly the finance companies and more recently diversifying from other banks saying they would like a bit in kiwibank as well and that really helps our retail funding
8162104 i think kiwis still want a kiwi owned bank and they are coming to kiwibank for that reason
8162105 no we dont give any thought to it because the policies of everyone out there are pretty clear and we work with the certainty we know rather than the uncertainy of speculation

8162112 they should never let anyone else use their vehicle unless they are sure that person is old enough and experienced enough to do so safety
8162113 what is blindingly obvious to every parliamentarian and commentator that the only reason the prime minister has not sacked mr peters is that she is absolutely desperate to get the legislation on the ets through
8162114 if the ets does not proceed the cost to the taxpayer of increasing emissions will be many hundreds of millions of dollars in the period to 2012 alone
8162115 i have mixed feelings about it but i think on balance its the right thing to do
8162116 i think its the right thing for the climate and for new zealands international reputation even though its only a small bit of the right thing its still better than the wrong thing
8162117 is the government now borrowing to buy the greens and new zealand firsts support for the ets

8162134 sas is compatible with sata which enable users such as it managers to combine high performance sas and high capacity sata storage applications allowing them to choose the most cost effective solution for their needs
8162135 sata drives can communicate over the same sas hardware giving the customer a choice for instance our dual port sas enclosures support 24 7 high availability systems such as web server appliances while routine backups can be offloaded to higher capacity lower cost per gb sata drives this flexibility also enables migration to more space saving and energy efficient solutions
8162136 in addition to flexibility another key advantage is speed sas and sata both provide max transfer rates of up to 3gb s but with sas full duplex architecture you get simultaneous bi directional data and command transfers providing effective bandwidth of 6gb s therefore crus new 4 bay enclosure featuring a unique 4 port host connector can provide a speedy 24gb s aggregate throughput

8162174 whether you need to view configuration files maintain an rss feed or learn about working with xml the new xmlspy standard edition is a cost effective solution for carrying out such tasks but for developers creating more complex xml and web services applications you will still need the powerful features and functionality found only in xmlspy professional and enterprise editions
8162175 it is clear based on yesterdays ruling that the lawsuit by taros independent directors was part of a calculated effort by barry levitt to avoid living up to his obligations under the option agreement it is time for dr levitt and his family to live up to the contract and do what is required of them under the option agreement
8162176 these shareholders benefited from suns investment which basically saved taro from collapse
8162177 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8162178 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8162179 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8162180 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8162181 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8162182 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno

8162191 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8162192 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8162193 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico

8162202 so i know how others are feeling here today and i know how difficult it is for them
8162203 and when you come home and you see scenes like this it does sink in that youve missed out you dont need to be told

8162229 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8162230 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8162231 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8162232 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8162233 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8162234 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8162236 i look up to him when i am playing not just for cricket but to show that if you persevere anything can happen
8162237 it is great to be celebrating his birthday to go to the same school and to have played cricket on this oval so many times it is just amazing to be living in the same place as he lived
8162238 i have always dreamed of being a great cricketer like him
8162239 we would have many discussions about various players he was a person who very much knew his own mind you had to have a very convincing argument if you wanted to disagree with him he did not suffer fools gladly
8162240 you rarely if ever heard him talk about his performances but he was always praising the performances of others
8162241 he dedicated his entire life to improving the game he was very determined that players were conscious of the need of spectators he wanted them to play bright attractive cricket and he impressed that on them
8162242 he was not only one of the greatest players but one of the games greatest administrators he fought to make the game fairer for everybody
8162243 he represented all that was best about how to live ones life
8162244 the fact that he could stride the world stage at cricket and yet remain essentially true to himself and the values of dignity integrity and modesty that he learnt here in bowral
8162245 he didnt think those values conflicted with courage determination competitiveness and ambition in fact they complimented one another that is his legacy
8162246 when i read it i dont wince which is all i ever ask for a book i write
8162247 how many observe christs birthday how few his precepts o tis easier to keep holidays than commandments
8162248 this will have a substantial impact on the healthcare system decreasing the pressure as more cancers are prevented
8162249 we have the knowledge today to reduce the cancer burden worldwide in australia cancer survival has increased significantly over the past two decades with 58 per cent of men and 64 per cent of females surviving beyond 5 years of their cancer diagnoses
8162250 if we compare this to the period from 1982 1986 only 41 per cent of men and 53 per cent of women were surviving five years after their cancer diagnoses
8162251 seventy per cent of worldwide cancer deaths have occurred in low and middle income countries which belies the assumption often made that cancer is not a significant problem beyond affluent nations
8162252 ones decision to avoid smoking be sunsmart reduce alcohol intake eat a nutritionally balanced diet exercise regularly and participate in vaccination programs can significantly impact the cancer burden

8162256 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8162277 beberapa hari yang ditentukan itu ialah bulan ramadhan bulan yang didalamnya diturunkan permulaan al quran sebagai petunjuk bagi manusia dan penjelasan penjelasan mengenai petunjuk itu dan pembeda antara yang haq dan batil karena itu barangsiapa diantara kamu menyaksikan di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah ia berpuasa di bulan itu
8162278 dalam ayat ini allah taala memuji bulan puasa yaitu bulan ramadhan dari bulan bulan lainnya allah memuji demikian karena bulan ini allah telah pilih sebagai bulan diturunkannya al quran dari bulan bulan lainnya sebagaimana pula pada bulan ramadhan ini allah telah menurunkan kitab ilahiyah lainnya pada para nabi alaihimussalam
8162279 apabila ramadhan tiba pintu surga dibuka pintu neraka ditutup dan setanpun dibelenggu
8162280 pintu pintu surga dibuka pada bulan ini karena banyaknya amal sholih yang dikerjakan sekaligus untuk memotivasi umat islam untuk melakukan kebaikan setan setan diikat kemudian dibelenggu tidak dibiarkan lepas seperti di bulan selain ramadhan
8162281 sesungguhnya kami telah menurunkannya al quran pada lailatul qadar malam kemuliaan dan tahukah kamu apakah malam kemuliaan itu malam kemuliaan itu lebih baik dari seribu bulan
8162282 sesungguhnya kami menurunkannya pada suatu malam yang diberkahi dan sesungguhnya kami lah yang memberi peringatan
8162283 sesungguhnya setiap hari yaitu pada bulan ramadhan allah taala membebaskan beberapa orang dari api neraka dan setiap muslim apabila dia memanjatkan doa maka pasti dikabulkan
8162284 puasa adalah perisai yang dapat melindungi seorang hamba dari api neraka
8162285 allah berfirman setiap amal anak adam aadalah untuknya kecuali puasa puasa tersebut adalah untuk ku dan aku akan membalasnya puasa adalah perisai apabila salah seorang dari kalian berpuasa maka janganlah berkat kotor jangan pula berteriak teriak jika ada seseorang yang mencaci dan mengajak berkelahi maka katakanlah saya sedang berpuasa demi dzat yang jiwa muhammad berada di tangannya sesungguhnya bau mulut orang yang berpuasa lebih harum di sisi allah pada hari kiamat daripada bau misik kasturi dan bagi orang yang berpuasa ada dua kegembiraan 1 ketika berbuka mereka bergembira dengan bukanya dan 2 ketka bertemu allah mereka bergembira karena puasanya
8162286 puasa dan al quran itu akan memberikan syafaat kepada seorang hamba pada hari kiamat nanti puasa akan berkata wahai tuhanku saya telah menahannya dari makan dan nafsu syahwat karenanya perkenankan aku untuk memberikan syafaat kepadanya dan al quran pula berkata saya telah melarangnya dari tidur pada malam hari karenanya perkenankan aku untuk memberi syafaat kepadanya beliau bersabda maka syafaat keduanya diperkenankan
8162287 barangsiapa yang berpuasa di bulan ramadhan karena iman dan mengharap pahala dari allah maka dosanya di masa lalu pasti diampuni
8162288 sesungguhnya di surga ada sebuah pintu yang disebut ar rayyaan pada hari kiamat orang orang yang berpuasa akan masuk surga melalui pintu tersebut dan tidak ada seorangpun yang masuk melalui pintu tersebut kecuali mereka dikatakan kepada mereka dimana orang orang yang berpuasa maka orang orang yang berpuasa pun berdiri dan tidak ada seorangpun yang masuk melalui pintu tersebut kecuali mereka jika mereka sudah masuk pintu tersebut ditutup dan tidak ada lagi seorangpun yang masuk melalui pintu tersebut

8162380 continuamos discutindo pessoas e n o posi es n o tenho d vida de que se lula colocar em vota o um terceiro mandato o povo vai querer
8162381 creio que lula n o quer preciso cuidado porque em momento dif cil qualquer loucura acontece
8162382 quando h den ncia tem de apurar n o tem outro jeito s isso
8162383 n o vejo diferen a nenhuma quando o presidente lula foi candidato em 1994 e fizeram den ncia sobre um apartamento que ele comprou
8162384 eu era candidato e disse que n o acho que ele seja uma pessoa que n o tenha uma vida correta
8162385 a mesma coisa que eu acho da governadora yeda os fatos t m de ser apurados
8162386 i want to add my voice to those of other local people who have expressed their heartfelt sadness and condolences to the family and friends of mohammed al majed
8162387 it is right and proper that after an incident such as this that we review the policy and service safeguards which are in place to prosper good community relations anti racism and the local economy and work out in a joined up way the lessons that need to be learned
8162388 but we must not jump in with both feet and we must allow sufficient time to get our facts straight so that we can make informed judgements and the changes that are necessary
8162389 i support cllr pragnell when he says that it only takes a few individuals to tar a towns reputation and we must do all that we can to preserve the good name of hastings
8162390 the police must be allowed to get on with their job and the politicians must for the moment take a back seat
8162391 never write in email anything that you wouldnt want your mother to read or to appear in the newspaper
8162392 together we can form joint companies with pdvsa and that way we can continue providing our experience and knowledge of the business
8162393 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single technology
8162394 are you certain they dont burn people at the stake anymore
8162395 the most pro abortion member of the senate with his straight a report card from the national abortion rights action league and planned parenthood
8162396 a candidate who by definition is deeply at odds with the core teachings of his own church
8162397 evasions employed to justify abortion catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves
8162398 the american proposition makes a particular claim upon the reflective attention of the catholic
8162399 by pluralism here i mean the coexistence within the one political community of groups who hold divergent and incompatible views with regard to religious questions those ultimate questions that concern the nature and destiny of man within a universe that stands under the reign of god pluralism therefore implies disagreement and dissension within the community but it also implies a community within which there must be agreement and consensus there is no small political problem here
8162400 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single technology
8162401 in truth most americans occupy a vast middle ground between the polarizing impulses of american culture
8162402 there is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america
8162403 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single technology
8162404 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single technology
8162405 its very hard to get your heart and head together in life in my case theyre not even friendly
8162406 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8162407 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8162408 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8162409 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed it further inflames an already tense situation in the region
8162410 direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity
8162411 it is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these u n provisions express their will to have an independent existence any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not
8162412 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order
8162413 should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussions among the parties
8162414 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8162415 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8162416 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom

8162425 es completamente contrario a nuestros intereses y objetivos lo condenamos rotundamente
8162426 i do not want to remember those dark days but coming here and talking to these blast victims would help us in understanding each other better
8162427 what we have lost cannot come back but now we have to reconcile to our fate these riot victims were the victims of hatred too these small initiatives will certainly help discourage the feeling of hatred among different communities here
8162428 these families from both the communities are victims of brutal violence but the attempts to politicize the recent blast issue are scary we need to fight the hatemongers who continue to spread the poison of communalism in the society
8162429 whatever happened to us was wrong we all are humans first we also want to fight these terrorists who kill innocent people and disrupt normal life
8162430 this is a symbolic start and we are hopeful that organizing these kinds of interaction will be helpful in creating a bridge between the two communities
8162431 properties would be assessed on various factors like age of property location usage area of the property the survey would give us an indepth assessment as to how many residential properties were put to commercial use how many houses have tenants and whether there are changes in the structure of the properties besides this anomalies like one property having two tax identification numbers too can be corrected
8162432 after the blast at trauma centre the staff of civil hospital quickly shifted all the injured patients to another ward
8162433 there were doctors who had seen it all happen in front of them and yet responded to the call of duty it shows the commitment of the staff towards duty as well as humanity
8162434 wherever we cannot provide footpaths we are ensuring wall to wall road carpeting
8162435 megha was probably more hurt that not only had her childhood boyfriend with whom she had thought she would build a life with dumped her he had also coerced her into having sex with him by allegedly blackmailing her she not only wanted to get rid of her blackmailer but also avenge the betrayal
8162436 many however feel this extreme betrayal and coldbloodedly plan to take revenge the fact that megha also hit kunal with a pipe and then lugged his body on his two wheeler to dispose it off shows that she did not feel any remorse and wanted to take revenge on her tormentor and betrayer
8162437 she said she even tried to strangle and sought medicine to keep her calm for her two children lest she do something she might regret later
8162438 the sophisticated medical equipment in shardaben hospital is more than 10 years old and hampers normal medical procedure but amc authorities are not concerned about it also there is no medical audit done in amcrun hospitals which shows how unconcerned authorities are about healthcare facilities
8162439 there was a major fire at lg hospital on june 16 which destroyed costly equipment at the hospital but so far no inquiry has been insituted by the authorities to find the reason for this major mishap
8162440 in her confessional statement megha has claimed that she had broken off with kunal and that he was using the video clips to blackmail her into submission this according to her was the cause behind the murder
8162441 we are hunting for those clips which kunal is alleged to have used to blackmail megha
8162442 meghas parents were not aware of this alleged oppression of kunal he used to come to her house to give tuitions on computer science and her parents had a very high opinion of him this is in sharp contrast to meghas allegations
8162443 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8162444 i think average voters are turned off by the tearing down
8162445 but not by the building up i think voters like to see people coming together
8162446 hillary at points disappointed me on how far she went to try to tear barack down but i take my hat off to her for how shes handling it now
8162447 it depends how much you want to win all that early stuff was intramural sports now were into the real season and in the end she wants him to win i believe that
8162448 the question is does that tough clinton obama primary make obama tougher a lot of hillary supporters are saying yes
8162449 i believe it does you really dont know what to believe
8162450 this was important as we had to select an area that did not have a slope otherwise a stationed train would start sliding down the track making it cumbersome for us to manage train boarding
8162451 while the tracks have arrived the fish plates will arrive in the next consignment from china shortly in september the engine and the coaches will be shipped from uk in october by this time we expect the work on the train maintenance yard to be completed
8162452 the name of the train has to be embossed on the engine and they have asked for a customized design for the train while the interiors are being readied
8162453 watching the energy and enthusiasm in the kids always brings a smile on my face activities undertaken by aproch are very encouraging these events expose talents children and natural leadership in children growing in different kinds of environment
8162454 during school time the parents reached the school and started enquiring till then we thought that the students were absent we tried looking for the students but they were nowhere to be found
8162455 the students of prerna are brought to school by a bus when we enquired with the bus drivers and other students we realised that the three students had never boarded the school bus where they had gone is however not known
8162456 the settlement activity is not conducive to creating an environment for negotiations
8162457 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses
8162458 it was a lousy night we pretty much screwed it up every way you can screw it up

8162494 we have had lots of people coming into the shop who would not normally come in specifically to sign the petition
8162495 there is still nothing firmer yet on the thoroughfare site as we await the report from the environment agency on the flood risk across the entire site that will have some impact on what uses the site can be put to because of this it looks like the public exhibition will be towards the end of september
8162496 we are totally committed to this project education has always been a major part of our remit as a charity and we have long been a centre of excellence where post graduate veterinary and scientific education is concerned
8162497 the new learning centre will enable us to extend this part of our work to include students of all ages and to enhance the teaching of science in local schools
8162498 people say they are more spacious than their usual classrooms
8162499 there will be interactive whiteboards air conditioning and quality carpeting
8162500 it is hard to imagine the damage to the school unless you see it
8162501 it is rare to lose a whole school and it is very sad for the staff who have put so much effort into creating a pleasant environment
8162502 but the essence of a school is good teaching and the staff are still here
8162503 it can be very distressing for both parents and children should they become separated especially when there are such large crowds about as there were on thursday and friday
8162504 with children being supplied with coloured wristbands it makes it much easier to get them back with their parents in a short space of time and helped ensure that they could all carry on enjoying their day together
8162505 the toughest period of trading in its life as a public company
8162506 bob is in a class of his own and has brought together so many people
8162507 the reason people are so outraged is that tindle seem to be treating their listeners as no brainers
8162508 we want answers we are standing up and saying listen to what your listeners want
8162509 it is a private matter being dealt with between us both when we are in a position to we will say something
8162510 we have good friendly banter between both clubs but to me this is not making for good relations and is going to put ipswich fans backs up towards norwich fans and it does not need to be like that
8162511 it is very petty in this day and age football supporters do not change clubs and they norwich do not need to be like this
8162512 we have no problem with the principle of local radio stations broadcasting commentary of their local teams matches to that teams traditional catchment area
8162513 however the proposals of sgr extend the broadcast range for their ipswich town commentaries throughout norfolk as far up the coast as cromer
8162514 the essence of the agreement with the football league is to allow radio stations to broadcast commentary to areas local to clubs
8162515 it is not as we understand it intended to allow clubs to broadcast to entire regions
8162516 the reason for this is ipswich town football club withdrew their request for it following talks between themselves and norwich city football club
8162517 clearly we are disappointed that sgr are not able to offer commentary via the norfolk gold dab service
8162518 we had hoped that sgr would be able to facilitate this following discussions with other parties however this has proved not to be the case
8162519 we had a fire on friday in a hyperbaric stall thanks to the vigilance of staff the fire was quickly dealt with but very unfortunately the two year old could not be saved
8162520 it seems there was a design fault and there will now be a full investigation
8162521 trish had chemotherapy and radiotherapy at essex county hospital and walked up there five days a week for the treatment
8162522 when she finished it though she took a turn for the worse and they told her she only had a few months to live unless she had more chemotherapy which would give her one or two years
8162523 but she took a turn for the worse and was taken into hospital where she was sedated for nearly a week and then she died
8162524 trish was very very positive and always focused on getting better
8162525 she was planning a trip to new york with a friend of hers from canada when she recovered
8162526 she loved her job she absolutely loved the pub and she was really into shopping i think clothes were her hobby
8162527 it is what trish would have wanted and it is something to keep me busy and not let me have too much time to think
8162528 i cannot save all of them but i can sure make a difference to this one
8162529 it took a little while but some memory from his pup hood eventually seemed to surface and he came for a closer inspection
8162530 once hed had a sniff and then slid over the top of it for the first time he found he actually likes it
8162531 we dont think it will be long now before sahara is a proper ice loving alaskan seal again
8162532 i felt the classroom was a bit restrictive and ive always been interested in aviation
8162533 i did my first flight at 11 when i was in a light single engine aircraft with my dad and i really enjoyed it
8162534 no one ever questions if a woman goes to get her driving licence but because its technical rather than a creative industry its assumed men are better at flying
8162535 you dont usually expect engineers to be girls women actually make very good pilots for a number of reasons they are more capable of multi tasking
8162536 when you are a pilot you need to listen in on the radio monitor your position on the systems like the distance you are from the next beacon and temperature of your cabin and monitor the fuel flow
8162537 in actual fact i have had comments about other women being better pilots than men
8162538 she accepts and appreciates it is an extremely unattractive offence that she has committed
8162539 these are a particularly mean and wicked series of thefts
8162540 he had true respect for women he was a true gentleman and thats what killed him
8162541 he got punched in the head because he was standing in front of a girl to protect her he was helping her just like hes done before
8162542 the other time he was stamped on the head as he tried to protect another girl we tried to make him report it but he was worried about reprisals
8162543 we tried to make him into a true gentleman and now we know that we succeeded
8162544 he saved five peoples lives with his organs he wanted every part to be taken the only thing i didnt let them take was his corneas
8162545 im proud that out of tragedy five other people have been given the gift of life he carried a donor card and put it on his driving licence too so that we knew his wishes
8162546 he was a lovely boy i cant tell you how much he will be missed he was a special young man we are absolutely devastated
8162547 he couldnt do enough for us he was 6ft 2ins and was a real gentle giant his grandfather is in a wheelchair because of ms and dominic would pick him up if he fell over and would lift him into the chair his grandfather is distraught we all are
8162548 the message is to his parents how can this boys parents be so uncaring as to have raised a vicious nasty person i hope their conscience is hurting as much as our grief
8162549 we have some special memories of dom but the memories arent long enough he was only 18
8162550 we have worked so hard financially physically and emotionally to mould him into a decent man and thats been taken away
8162551 dear dom you have no idea the amount of jokes weve been having these last few days talking about our memories with you and it makes me happy to know youll see many more while looking down on us im going to miss you bruv love tank xxxxxx
8162552 he brought happiness to so many people and will be very missed by everyone who loved him forever in my heart rachel t xxx
8162553 a very good idea of who we are looking for
8162554 we should disclose that the band has been going through some hard times recently both as a band and as individuals

8162582 hay casas de 5 000 varas cuadradas que pagan 8 por ejemplo por el servicio de agua y hay casas de 400 varas cuadradas que pagan 500 tiene que hacerse una revisi n y un ordenamiento de los subsidios pero se va hacer bien
8162583 hoy por hoy que la situaci n econ mica es cr tica yo creo que debemos ser pr cticos ayudar a nuestra gente
8162584 son necesarios en estos momentos tan dif ciles a escala mundial en la econom a pero deben focalizarse
8162585 si provocamos una segunda hay que sentarse a hacer una valoraci n de qui n da m s y con qui n nos conviene m s hacer un cogobierno si con el frente o con arena no estamos casados con ninguno de los dos ahorita
8162586 tenemos que generar confianza al pa s si nos toca gobernar con el fmln tenemos que pedir ministerios y una parte de la formaci n del ejecutivo para poderle garantizar al pa s la estabilidad y lo mismo ser a con arena
8162587 no hay que pedir el sol porque te puede quemar
8162588 si forzamos a una segunda ronda provocaremos a partir del 1 de junio de 2009 el gobierno de unidad nacional que rescate de la polarizaci n y del desgarre al pa s
8162589 quien acepte nuestra visi n de pa s va a tener el respaldo del pcn en segunda ronda eso permitir poner personas capaces en ministerios aut nomas corte suprema de justicia corte de cuentas y en todas las instituciones del estado
8162590 eso es algo que no hemos discutido pero que se tiene que conversar
8162591 son una posibilidad que uno descarta pero m s creemos que es una forma elegante de decirle no a arena
8162592 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
8162593 theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night
8162594 their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
8162595 inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her something he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
8162596 and as i tuck that little girl in and her little sister into bed at night you see i will think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election
8162597 i think im gonna stay unmarried and just go for the babies
8162598 here is a man who has done 99 great things in his life but hes only being remembered lately for one mistake hes made
8162599 pathetic and really had no place being part of this event
8162600 the pages in between a holocaust legacy of two families one home
8162601 they say that time heals a broken heart but time has stood still since weve been apart
8162602 yes a bunch a foreigners who on the one hand im sure have nothing but condemnation for past american intrusions in other countries politics but have no problem using their talent celebrity status to try to influence an american election ghastly was my opinion as well until the very end when i became absolutely disgusted by it it takes some kind of dishonesty to include a clip of a man with his ear to a womans belly implying hes listening to a childs heartbeat or the baby kicking or something considering obamas support for killing that child at that same moment or at the moment of the childs birth or if all that fails leaving the child to die in a closet
8162603 some people play the drums too much then they start singing like theyre drums if youre gonna sing like something it should be a violin for gods sake
8162604 this market is expected to grow globally by about 20 percent every year
8162605 the demand for solar power will likely reach 5 550 megawatts by 2012
8162606 the bullet was leaving the barrel just fine the trouble must have been at the other end
8162607 the key to the house is below the front door mat
8162608 but i must warn you do not talk to the parot please do not talk to the parrot
8162609 i simply do not love you they way i had when we first met
8162610 and no were not going to come after you and ask you to take it off your facebook or myspace page
8162611 in 55 years i made 147 movies thats a lot of movies
8162612 never lifted my head just one picture next picture i did that for 10 years and at the end of the 10 years i was a player all over the place
8162613 get stuck in some series playing a certain type and if theyre doing that two years later they havent had a chance to try different things and if you go from picture to picture youre almost forced to do that
8162614 you had to become very open in your brain in your thinking so there was nothing in your sense of who you are that you objected to im sitting here talking to you and if i saw little slivers of my movies i would remember that i was a hairdresser a boxer a female impersonator a viking a trapeze artist
8162615 i had to mentally psych myself so that when i put on those clothes that wardrobe i believed it and everybody else started to believe it
8162616 the review is driven by a need to continue to produce the best boats in the waterways business whilst retaining our competitive edge
8162617 the parish council would be very concerned to know that there was a possibility of skilled jobs being diluted in the village
8162618 there are relatively small numbers of jobs available in the village particularly for younger people
8162619 i think therell be a short term gain at the moment we always struggle to get skilled staff so in the short term youd probably pick up a few people
8162620 in the long term people go away from the industry which has got to work against us its an industry that is shrinking and it cant do us any good at all in the long term
8162621 ive taken a lot of courses and wasted lots of money with some of those so called national real estate
8162622 its hard to go wrong with a family thats been successfully doing this business for over

8162641 da hat man gesehen dass wir den weg zum gegnerischen tor kennen wir werden steaua nicht untersch tzen aber wir sind das bessere team
8162642 die leute erwarten nat rlich dass wir weiterkommen aber wir spielen nicht gegen ein mickey maus team

8162668 that there are no good choices people get split up and can never find each other again and i saw a few frustrated faces after having to walk a mile from the car drop and then wait an hour in line to get into the pepsi center
8162669 into the rhythm of how to maneuver through it all and on balance it is incredible

8162672 it may well be the largest collage anyone has ever made so thats my formal motivation in a nut shell mere opportunity im now beginning to realize why leonardo left so many of his masterpieces unfinished maybe they were too damn much work

8162674 there is absolutely nothing to link hari puttar with harry potter
8162675 even if it does rhyme with harry potter surely there is a limit to cases
8162676 however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
8162677 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session
8162678 we sent out a press release one day saying we were on the verge of closing it down and the next day we had 500 000
8162679 they shine the light on the real emergencies and step up where we really need help
8162680 for me the whole goal is to stay relevant as long as i can
8162681 while not implying any specific malfeasance with the membership suspension
8162682 reposition itself as a ministry that is above question or reproach
8162683 if thats the way they feel about it thats fine
8162684 there were certain things going on we would never allow in our rescue missions

8162690 people are in my office all day when shes here
8162691 it has a calming effect i look forward to coming here every week and seeing the dogs
8162692 it keeps your mind off the crummy things in life
8162693 i was bad because i knew i was being deployed so i let him do anything he wanted
8162694 children with special needs will be able to relate to me better than a person whos whole
8162695 theyll see me and think hes got only one leg and he did it
8162696 it goes along with the therapy im doing its another challenge
8162697 being an officer in the army you have to be a leader
8162698 you have to do the same thing there motivate them get them to do what they need to do and enjoy it
8162699 central self storage in austin is one of the best placed self storage facilities that ive seen the facility is located in a neighborhood consisting of high density multi family complexes that expand as far as you can see with little to no competition the application of professional management cleanup and a repair to an existing retaining wall is all that is needed to stabilize and maximize this great opportunity
8162700 the acquisition of central self storage of corpus christi signifies our entrance into corpus christi storage market with the long term objective of creating a dominant foothold in the area
8162701 texas continues to be a strong economy with huge opportunity for us we will continue to identify and pursue exceptional facilities in all of the major population centers in texas
8162702 we have great solar intensity at the latitude of tunisia coupled with a very cool microclimate
8162703 around los olivos theres gravelly clay and loam with some limestone deposits i have four soil types on my property
8162704 we have 60 different varieties and 300 cultivars clones within a 40 mile wide coastal throat its the most diverse region in the world
8162705 bordeaux grapes moving east pinot noir moving west and rhone varieties filling in the middle
8162706 the only problem will be what to call whats left over
8162707 growing grapes and making wine sustainably is all about stepping gently into natures realm nudging rather than fighting it
8162708 in an ideal world the sustainable winery would use only hand tools customers and workers would walk or bike here and we would refill glass bottles or goatskin bota wine bags from the barrel but the reality is we bring in farm equipment use cars and packaging materials our responsibility is to consider the big picture
8162709 from green power to green packaging we need to make quality wine and add to the quality of life of our employees and consumers
8162710 miljenkos is worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it fact is that wine is the first to sell out each year in just a few months its a combination of source a 110 year old vineyard and quantity only 300 cases
8162711 as a winemaker its fun to do other things besides cabernet to challenge yourself
8162712 acknowledges several realities the most pressing being our companys need to focus our resources on newsgathering advertising sales and customer service
8162713 times have changed since the era in which many ombudsmen and public editor jobs were established readers now have multiple ways to be heard within the newspaper and in the community
8162714 the company knowingly stole from its customers mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps
8162715 the attorney generals characterization of our conduct and the parties voluntary settlement is not accurate
8162716 we of course are committed to treating our customers fairly and we voluntarily ended the computer process at issue on our own in 2003
8162717 our winter schedule is slower in the period from january to early march so were matching supply to demand
8162718 we need to find someone who knows news someone whos able to ad lib someone whos authentic and someone who has a voice that viewers will respect that will be tough
8162719 weve skipped past the generation that grew up with the unfortunate experience of liebfraumilch and sugary sweet rieslings of the past to the 20 and 30 somethings who are not burdened by such preconceptions
8162720 these consumers have come to riesling on their own by way of sommeliers and retailers and have found a wine they really enjoy and theyve spread the word
8162721 people would shun the wine insisting that all rieslings were sweet and that they only drink dry wine todays younger consumers are eager to try something new and high quality dry riesling strikes a chord
8162722 there was some shaping but what the editor wanted was more of everything
8162723 which is a testament to what mary ann had created
8162724 that writing group was a ruse not unlike the guernsey literary society created for the express purpose of getting mary ann to write
8162725 they knew she would be forced to produce something when it was her turn
8162726 no one quite knew why germany expended so much energy on the channel islands
8162727 i drifted off into the underbrush and bumped up against german battlements
8162728 my favorite part came as we drove from st peter port to the town of st martins coming out of the city and into the countryside
8162729 there i could see that ineffable what it looks like that i needed so badly when i was writing
8162730 something halfway between normandy and the northern california coast craggy gray cliffs rolling green fields leaping bunnies old houses covered in rose vines
8162731 it was everything i had hoped it would be not only in order to be correct but in order to love it
8162732 everyone acknowledges that this is a great place to grow dessert wines but its history is in table wines except for quady and ficklin
8162733 some port aficionados turn up their nose at the flavored wines
8162734 theyre particularly popular among people who like sweet wines but cant tolerate much alcohol
8162735 anything will grow here you just have to pay more for different flavor profiles
8162736 we have a large plot planted in many varieties by angelo papagni but the rhone varieties do especially well
8162737 the chardonnay does fine and we have no trouble selling it
8162738 subject a apparently believes that she is being pursued she is not subject as normal pursuer subject b
8162739 is in no way involved in the current whatever it is subject a closely examines an invisible piece of dust bats at it twice discovers that its nonexistent and looks around several more times perhaps hoping to catch her enemies unawares
8162740 subject a sprints toward the kitchen failing to decelerate fast enough to avoid another collision with the pantry
8162741 instead of dashing through the door subject a leapt on the bed pounced on the sleeping subject b pummeled her briefly and raced off again out of the bedroom and back toward me
8162742 subject b may be developing a theory of events but she is looking in precisely the wrong direction as if the crows outside were her nominees for the unprovoked attack upon her person or upon her cat whatever the correct legal term is
8162743 meanwhile subject a is crouched on the back of the couch her eyes darting back and forth prepared for any emergency
8162744 subject a and subject b attack each other simultaneously there is much rolling around no injuries are incurred subject a begins licking subject bs face and the matter is satisfactorily resolved
8162745 conclusion kittens exhibit poor impulse control signs of incipient paranoia delusional behavior physically inappropriate gestures and unprovoked aggression they are most probably insane thank you
8162746 em lia scrubbed her soles with boiled water and a loofah in order to make them white the way a ladys feet should look but the stains remained
8162747 for what she did not know not death that would have already come to her slowly and stealthily killing her little by little each day of her lonely existence
8162748 their gums bled their hair lost its pigment turning a sickly orange and falling out in knotted clumps luzias men and women began to look like terrified animals a clear slime ran from their noses their faces were gaunt and their eyes bulged the whites turned yellow
8162749 luzia felt something harden inside her like warm molasses poured into wooden blocks and set in the cold night to solidify

8162758 as you all know by now barack obama sent out a cell phone text message at 3 a m on saturday morning to tell everyone he picked joe biden as his vice president how do you think this makes hillary clinton feel huh finally she gets a telephone call at 3 a m its to tell her they picked joe biden
8162759 joe biden is barack obamas running mate yeah nothing says change like a guy whos been in the senate for 35 years
8162760 although joe biden is in great physical condition republicans are raising questions about his health now i guess he had a brain aneurysm a couple of years ago hey you cant expect every vice president to be the picture of health like dick cheney
8162761 the theme of the democratic convention is unity unfortunately they cant agree on how that works
8162762 yeah the democratic convention is in denver and security is tight out there it is very tight its tighter than nancy pelosis face
8162763 this thursday barack obama is gonna give his acceptance speech and reportedly its going to include performances by bon jovi and bruce springsteen yeah and they say obamas not black enough
8162764 tomorrow night at the democratic convention to show her support for barack obama hillary clinton is going to give a speech
8162765 the current issue of newsweek magazine has a picture of president bush on the cover with the headline what bush got right yeah its true newsweek says what bush got right is their shortest cover story since januarys issue on famous korean rabbis
8162766 tropical storm fay has soaked florida ruining thousands of homes most of them belonging to john mccain in fact to make senator mccain feel at home tonight we gave him seven dressing rooms
8162767 john edwards has admitted to having an affair but hes denying that he is the father of the womans baby in fact he says a member of his campaign staff is the babys father campaign staff how does that work what was edwards running late that day huh had to send an advance man in look i cant have sex with you im sending bob down
8162768 wir haben beschlossen dass wir nicht in eine bieterschlacht eintreten
8162769 die einzigen profiteure w ren die tns aktion re gewesen
8162770 wir haben nie dar ber gesprochen mit welchem investor wir verhandeln
8162771 das unternehmen wird auch weiterhin gut aufgestellt sein volle auftragsb cher vorweisen und organisch wachsen auch angesichts der verlangsamung der weltwirtschaft
8162772 wo m rkte und der wettbewerb nachhaltig funktionieren m ssen wir nicht eingreifen
8162773 aber eine solche regionale differenzierung birgt neben chancen auch risiken so dass vor einer entscheidung alles aspekte sehr sorgf ltig gepr ft werden m ssen
8162774 meine g ste sind fast alle in den zwanzigern des vorigen jahrhunderts geboren haben den zweiten weltkrieg erlebt den kalten krieg diesen sachverstand brauchen wir heute
8162775 die kriege zwischen staaten werden weniger die innerstaatlichen auseinandersetzungen mehr
8162776 einen teil ihres eigenen landes berfallen dann sind die russen in diese angelegenheit verstrickt worden
8162777 man hat die nato aufgeblasen und keine sicherheitsarchitektur geschaffen in die russland eingebunden ist
8162778 wann immer die sowjets panzer in bewegung setzen wird porzellan zerschlagen die russen neigen bei solchen aktionen immer zu brutalit t
8162779 in ossetien kamen die russen nicht als feinde sondern als befreier
8162780 die tschechen wollten freie menschen sein die sind ja nicht in polen eingefallen und haben die dortigen sowjetischen truppen angegriffen
8162781 auch im k ltesten kalten krieg das gespr ch weitergef hrt
8162782 wir haben in zeiten des k ltesten kalten kriegs das gespr ch weitergef hrt nie haben wir es abgebrochen auch nicht beim berfall der sowjetunion auf afghanistan
8162783 die lage kann schneller au er kontrolle geraten als wir glauben
8162784 die spirale der provokationen muss aufh ren und zwar sofort sonst kann die lage schneller au er kontrolle geraten als wir glauben
8162785 wenn wir nicht aufpassen ger t die gesamte sicherheitsarchitektur in europa ins wanken mit unabsehbaren folgen f r uns alle
8162786 sie versteht wie die russen sind sie hat schlie lich unter ihnen gelebt sie wei dass l gen f r sie ein normales mittel der kommunikation ist und dass sie sehr brutal sein k nnen
8162787 an uns allen die russische aggression zur ckzudr ngen wenn sie damit durchkommen werden sie weitermachen sie werden auch andere benachbarte l nder angreifen
8162788 hat alle fr heren resolutionen zerschmettert und eine v llig neue realit t geschaffen
8162789 die russischen aktionen sind eine massive blockade auf dem weg zu einer einheitlichen position des sicherheitsrats
8162790 russland h lt vertragstreue nicht f r ein prinzip an sich das muss sich nun jeder investor in russland klarmachen
8162791 man darf nicht mit etwas drohen was uns letzten endes mehr schadet als den russen
8162792 wer jetzt die gespr chsf higkeit verliert dient weder den betroffenen noch dem frieden und den internationalen beziehungen
8162793 es bleibt entscheidend wichtig weiterhin die gespr chskan le nach moskau offen zu halten
8162794 beide seiten haben ein interesse daran jetzt nicht die eskalationsschraube weiter hochzudrehen
8162795 were going to look opportunistically to the m amp a market
8162796 he needs help in sacramento it was a partnership made in denver
8162797 our business is based on a combination of not only what you know but who you know
8162798 if you volunteer your time people recognize the value and youre appreciated
8162799 we will be brimming with pride today he has never failed to come up to scratch and for him to be honoured in this way is just fantastic
8162800 it is i think the best offensive line since ive been at byu when you look across the board when you look at the experience and the ability
8162801 i think it could end up being the best one that ive been around that ive been fortunate enough to work with
8162802 i mean we are just big and athletic and the guys understand the offense and they are smart
8162803 we could have the best o line in the conference maybe the country theyre great
8162804 hes inexperienced i guess but hes a very fast learner
8162805 there will be some learning curve and there will be some mistakes he will make young mistakes but he is very mature and he is older than the average freshman and he is very talented
8162806 i am just trying to get it down obviously there is a lot to learn it is a challenge but i like it i have a lot of people around me helping me out so i should be ok
8162807 i think it is a six man line with willing the first backup in and then theres a seventh and eighth coming
8162808 wir haben bei 32 der 48 a320 die f r 2008 und 2009 bestellt waren die auslieferung auf 2010 bis 2012 verschoben
8162809 das wichtigste ist das die auftr ge nicht storniert werden
8162810 theyve both made strides the last couple of weeks and theyre closer now than theyve ever been
8162811 our goal with them is hopefully both of them will be ready to play and well play both
8162812 well be running the same plays with both in there
8162813 were just wanting guys to execute the system and not make turnovers and make plays when there are opportunities to make them its the first game everything is going to happen fast to them
8162814 were accounting for all different roles in the spread offense
8162815 we expect them to be fast and good players if theyre on scholarship at michigan theyre going to be a good player
8162816 its as much as youd expect for the first year
8162817 our thing is we have to be careful we have inexperienced players and we have to teach fundamentals and schemes we wont have as much in early as we will later in the year or years to come but we have enough that our players are comfortable with it
8162818 the biggest buyout firms are used to gaming the system to turn a profit its no surprise they want special rules now to take over another sector of our economy
8162819 the pigeon problem in stamford has got worse and worse over the last five or six years
8162820 we have been getting lots of complaints about the mess they are making and it has now got to the extent where it is uncontrollable
8162821 i heard about the pigeon pill and i think it s a good idea provided only the pigeons get hold of it
8162822 while we would applaud any pigeon control programme that is non lethal and humane the contraceptive ovocontrol p has a long way to go before it satisfies picas uk that it is wholly non lethal humane and cost effective
8162823 das gilt auch f r baden w rttemberg und bayern
8162824 wenn der mann noch lange im amt ist dann verstehe ich nicht mehr warum man das beamtentum braucht
8162825 this is a product i would definitely recommend i have dry sensitive skin that needs a lot of hydration and constant care this gel based mask is perfect for me it has a very subtle tingle on my skin without the feeling of it being irritated the masque stays on your skin as it was applied meaning it doesnt dry up and get all crusty which can be a bit annoying and restricting i followed a tip that was suggested to put it in the fridge and apply the masque as a cooling treatment this made it even better during the hot summer day
8162826 this is exactly how i like my exfoliator rough right to where you feel it actually getting down to the nitty gritty grime and dirt in those pores the texture is amazing hard and grainy and it doesnt change when oyu add water and when you rinse it off you can actually see the difference in your skin it feels and looks super clean glowing and healthy
8162827 this is a very simple cream that gives a nice glow i wouldnt recommend it to anyone with oily skin because it does have a greasy feel even on my dry skin it didnt fully absorb and if you are not a fan of the smell of sunscreen in your moisturizer than i also wouldnt suggest this other than that its bearable but there are definitely better products that moisturize and protect without the pasty sunscreen feel and smell
8162828 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
8162829 it feels like the day after a holiday we have been so slow
8162830 it doesnt help that we have 35 officers in riot gear outside the door
8162831 im sure the palm mortons and capital grille are just fine
8162832 our phones are maybe ringing about 10 percent of what they normally do
8162833 if it wasnt for our other store we would have nothing
8162834 were going to be banging around the bottom for a while
8162835 2008 is going to be a very rough year with some recovery in 2009 very mild recovery
8162836 the biggest challenge is in the number of low priced homes from the distressed market
8162837 the magnitude of losing three flights will be very minimal
8162838 we will reinstate the tax credit before the end of the year i guarantee it
8162839 the supply chain is going to be a big deal
8162840 this is for those who want to learn to shop smarter
8162841 we take a close look at all the different value items we have in every department
8162842 the whole paycheck moniker has really come back to bite in an environment where the consumers need to feel like theyre getting good value
8162843 the tour is not just about finding the best prices in the department
8162844 its about learning the quality difference and the options they have available
8162845 we do it as part of our weight loss program for women
8162846 it teaches them how to buy for their families at whole foods because of the value of nutritious and organic foods
8162847 it teaches people how they can afford to buy healthy for the same price they would be spending at king soopers
8162848 in the last group i know three women are now shopping on a regular basis at whole foods
8162849 if very little preference is extended to the filipino vis vis the japanese investors under the jpepa what is the value of being a filipino in your own national economy
8162850 we gave up everything and we gained nothing under jpepa for a treaty that is so patently unconstitutional and for its failure to obtain the needed gains for filipino farmers fisherfolk workers and exporters there is only one logical just and moral step that the senate can take and that is to reject the jpepa
8162851 its strange and very unusual iab must issue an order recognizing them thats normal procedure
8162852 i filed the case against him because i was not informed that he would give the money i donated for the water pumps to gawad kalinga gk instead
8162853 we have previously banded in fellowship for what we believe is righteous we do so again this time to defend a good man
8162854 the fellowship continues as we stand together and say to the special prosecutor stay the course the fight against graft and corruption has always been a lonely battle this much we have learned in our time together time and true struggle will unmask the mere opportunist and those without conviction we have faith in you
8162855 i think you cant get any freedom unless you are
8162856 i adore animals but cats and raccoons become boring after a time

8162861 the terms of the financing available did not enable a sufficiently compelling alternative cash offer to be made for tns
8162862 sas is compatible with sata which enable users such as it managers to combine high performance sas and high capacity sata storage applications allowing them to choose the most cost effective solution for their needs
8162863 sata drives can communicate over the same sas hardware giving the customer a choice for instance our dual port sas enclosures support 24 7 high availability systems such as web server appliances while routine backups can be offloaded to higher capacity lower cost per gb sata drives this flexibility also enables migration to more space saving and energy efficient solutions
8162864 in addition to flexibility another key advantage is speed sas and sata both provide max transfer rates of up to 3gb s but with sas full duplex architecture you get simultaneous bi directional data and command transfers providing effective bandwidth of 6gb s therefore crus new 4 bay enclosure featuring a unique 4 port host connector can provide a speedy 24gb s aggregate throughput

8162867 within the world of basketball within those trail blazers teams he was a jokester
8162868 he was a big loving teddy bear at times guys got frustrated because he didnt have a mean streak
8162869 he was just a great guy he loved the team atmosphere loved being a teammate in those successful blazer teams
8162870 when you got hugged by kevin duckworth you got hugged
8162871 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
8162872 you can if you wish class all science fiction together but it is
8162873 your poor son who got killed in some far gt off place for some big market interests was really somebody exceptional
8162874 ultimately all you will ever need is your single openid url or an email address linked to it heres where you can get your own openid and all of the sites that support it
8162875 its true that most corporate blogs are boring and nobody reads them and thats because many corporate communicators either dont get blogging or if they do are having a heck of a time inspiring glasnost in the executive suite whats the roi who has time to blog what will legal say
8162876 the invention of the telephone ushered in an era of on demand social connection these conversations were freeing but were still limited to location and time as communication technology matured telephones became detached from their cords and were allowed to travel with their users this detachment from location allowed conversation to happen in more times and more places
8162877 but theyre letting people back through the street now and the tactical response group have come back outside the bank
8162878 they the student pilots will be devastated as will the instructors because the instructors have a real bond with the students theyre sitting beside them for hours and hours and hours mr rushton said
8162879 the pilot in their handling of the incident avoiding the school was certainly heroic it could have been catastrophic
8162880 it was pleasing that everybody at the school was safe and no one was affected there
8162881 i was driving by and i heard a big bang and saw him go into the back of a fellows garage darren told fairfax radio network
8162882 me and another couple of guys jumped in and borrowed a fire extinguisher from the school to put it out
8162883 when responding to a scene like this of course weve got to consider the worst outcome its a residential area main through roads for the local school its opposite the residents and despite the tragic outcome of one person deceased this afternoon were certainly very pleased that no other parties were affected by this incident this afternoon
8162884 im a bit nervous now im still a bit scared
8162885 the next thing i knew there was a loud explosion and black smoke he told fairfax radio
8162886 i heard this really loud noise and all of a sudden there was a boom and a big explosion
8162887 you could see big black smoke and flames were coming out
8162888 you could see bits of plane flying off and flames shooting up
8162889 we were told a plane hit a building at cheltenham
8162890 as we understand it and were waiting for final confirmation of this two light planes possibly landing or taking off from moorabbin have clipped wings
8162891 one of those planes landed successfully and the other has crash landed into a houses garden area and as we understand it it was the pilot of the crashed plane that has been killed
8162892 there is a school right on the corner if it had come down another few hundred yards it would have been in the school
8162893 on a hot night youll be sitting in your tv room and you can hardly hear the tv they come down so low
8162894 it was nerve racking ive thought about it often what would happen if one of those planes came down its so densely populated and if youre driving down centre dandenong road they would almost touch your car during landing
8162895 i always thought somethings going to happen one day and ive lived to see it
8162896 because they are both training aircraft and both are operated by the royal victoria aero club you would assume they were both on training exercises
8162897 moorabbin airport holds a certificate from us and we audit them but we dont look at the geographic location of the airport thats a planning issue for the government
8162898 most of the big training airports in australia are in pretty similar suburban locations so its not as if moorabbin is robinson crusoe in this situation it used to be way out in the bush and the city has grown up around it
8162899 i always hated japan and ive come to hate it more these days
8162900 i explode with anger whenever they say its their territory
8162901 japans past wrongdoing and its colonial rule are condensed in these tiny islets
8162902 japan is of the view that both sides should respond calmly to this issue recognizing the differences in positions between our countries as differences in positions
8162903 should fire the head of the national police agency to show his sincerity
8162904 from 60 sites at present there should be no more than 20 in the future
8162905 we are counting among other things on people taking early retirement
8162906 because we have been getting closer to ramadan and it is impossible to do that the executions during ramadan and eid al fitr
8162907 so we are trying to find the right time for the executions this year
8162908 our government hopes to launch the first round of negotiations with japan in september on fishing rights with both sides shelving sovereignty disputes and working together to manage and develop fishery resources
8162909 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8162910 ominously points to splits inside the military with camps divided between those who support and oppose prime minister samak sundaravej who serves concurrently as defense minister
8162911 samak has reached an accommodation with top ranking military leaders including army commander general anupong paochinda and first army commander prayuth chan ocha but a hardline camp has reportedly refused to fall in step
8162912 its an incredibly dangerous situation which has pitted the entrenched political old guard against a democratically elected government the real problem in thailand is the way society is completely polarised the government is part of a system that has tried somewhat to change that
8162913 we have a democratic government elected by a majority of the people around the country the gangs should respect the majority of the people and not try to create the social disorder
8162914 the behavior and tactics of the thai opposition would appear to have been copied from a cia manual
8162915 rural voters were quite rational in handing him thaksin landslide victories in 2001 and 2005
8162916 the allegations of corruption conflicts of interest and vote buying that surround him thaksin are serious but hardly unusual such practices are endemic in thai politics
8162917 the generals courtiers and bureaucrats who have been in charge for the past 15 months have ruled dismally thailands economy is now one of the slowest growing in booming asia
8162918 there is a power struggle going on within the army
8162919 on one side we have the reformers who want to end the armys links to drugs and karaoke bars they want to purge the army of mafia colonels and on the other side we have the conservatives who want to continue to do deals with the burmese junta and the drugs barons
8162920 an opportunity has been missed to address the flaws which keep two million workers in conditions which shame a modern economy
8162921 it is disappointing that ministers are not prepared to extend the coverage of the gangmasters licensing authority to other vulnerable sectors such as construction care and hospitality
8162922 nor has the government been prepared to examine the legal loophole that deprives many workers from gaining the legal status of an employee
8162923 allegations of mistreatment relating to the working and housing conditions of 251 bulgarians who had been sent to work at david leslies scones of lethendy berry farm in perthshire
8162924 there are no plans at the moment to review the gla we dont think extending its remit to the construction industry is the best way forward
8162925 government has missed the opportunity to expand the remit of the gangmasters licensing authority which plays a valuable role in protecting workers in the agricultural and food processing industries
8162926 shelter is calling for the gla to extend their remit to other sectors such as construction cleaning and hospitality in order to help lift all workers out of bad housing
8162927 this is in the interests of workers themselves and as was made clear by business representatives on the forum it is in the interests of the reputable businesses who treat their workers fairly and obey the law
8162928 there has been extensive discussion in the forum though no agreement on whether the gangmaster licensing authoritys licensing regime should be extended to employment agencies operating in sectors other than agriculture and food processing
8162929 once youve seen the damage they can do you know theres a need to respond quickly
8162930 right now its too early to tell how many trees will have to be removed
8162931 i kind of wish i went out yesterday i wanted to see ted kennedy
8162932 theyre going to have a huge turnout im convinced of it
8162933 often the refrain you hear is i dont vote and they walk by the table with the implication that its irrelevant
8162934 a tremendous number of people said yes i want to make sure im registered
8162935 there have been some fairly massive efforts to mobilize those people
8162936 those increases in the registration numbers add up year after year
8162937 more and more young people are beginning to understand the connection between their future and participating in the electoral process
8162938 in 2007 we had to call nonprofits and community organizations and beg them if we could come in and make a presentation about voter registration
8162939 this year we cant keep up with the phone calls coming in
8162940 you get the feeling of impending excitement that its just in terms of voting in massachusetts this is the calm before the storm
8162941 higher education unions have been at the bargaining table for eight months and the administration still refuses to make any economic offer
8162942 stay at the table as we have always done for as long as it takes to develop acceptable contracts
8162943 the administration continues to work diligently to determine what it can do to provide higher education and other state employees with compensation packages that are equitable and prudent given the fiscal challenges that the commonwealth faces
8162944 standing by to help implement it through the negotiating process
8162945 they have neglected their obligation to negotiate fairly with their unions and we have had enough
8162946 i would say this matter remains an active and ongoing investigation
8162947 you know what happens when any person is brought into a court by a very public case
8162948 i expect inconsistencies that doesnt mean somebodys not telling the truth
8162949 he kept repeating that he was an undercover state trooper
8162950 as you might imagine this is a serious breach of our system and will require significant work to determine how to prevent this from happening again
8162951 its a serious matter and were treating it as such
8162952 we ask you that you speak with your children and ask them not to pass along the file which is still happening but to instead delete the e mail if they have already downloaded the file please ask them to delete it from the computer for the information is stolen property
8162953 this neighborhood has fought for years and years to get the funds and things that it needs to make it a big part of this community
8162954 i just think this has to be one of those unfortunate events that happened to have happened here
8162955 this is just a great neighborhood with great neighbors who watch out for each other
8162956 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
8162957 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
8162958 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
8162959 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it
8162960 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
8162961 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
8162962 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
8162963 the best exercise he can do is sustained walking allowing for both arm and leg exercise

8162965 attention if obama becomes presedant i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
8162966 it will be such a slap in the face of white america that millions of americans will join their movement and bring on the race war they have been waiting for
8162967 are white people ready to accept a black man as president of the united states what we would hope is that we would look at him not as a black man but as a citizen of this country
8162968 but i know this country they killed my brother they killed robert kennedy i know what this country can do if they want to get rid of you they can do it

8162971 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action
8162972 moscows action deserves condemnation from the entire international community and russia must understand that its violations of international law carry consequences
8162973 todays decision the culmination of a long effort aimed at splitting these two regions away from georgia represents a major step forward in that process
8162974 the u s should lead within the u n and other international forums to cast a clear and unrelenting light on the decision and to further isolate russia internationally because of its actions
8162975 if russias government continues to violate the norms and practices of the international community the united states and our allies must review all aspects of relations with russia
8162976 save your lives and reach relief camps and other safe places there is very little time to escape the death and destruction
8162977 should fire the head of the national police agency to show his sincerity

8162992 we want to help manufacturers all over the state locate trading partners in overseas markets from chicago elgin and rockford to aurora joliet and naperville
8162993 while state and national governments sit on their hands and continue to blame their political opponents for the lagging economy its american businesses and innovation as always making a positive difference
8162994 they asked about our actions our roles about our lives everything from where i went to high school to everything i ate in china
8162995 the scariest it was beyond anything i could imagine in a movie
8162996 the protesters participated in tibet independence activities and that is against chinas law
8162997 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plans are the billions of dollars hes promising in more tax cuts to oil companies and the only thing that hell recycle is the same failed george bush approach to energy policy

8163012 evasions employed to justify abortion catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves
8163013 the american proposition makes a particular claim upon the reflective attention of the catholic
8163014 by pluralism here i mean the coexistence within the one political community of groups who hold divergent and incompatible views with regard to religious questions those ultimate questions that concern the nature and destiny of man within a universe that stands under the reign of god pluralism therefore implies disagreement and dissension within the community but it also implies a community within which there must be agreement and consensus there is no small political problem here
8163015 in truth most americans occupy a vast middle ground between the polarizing impulses of american culture

8163026 putin has revealed himself as a new breed of dictator a highly refined version this is no longer about communism or even pure nationalism it is a closed system in which the first person to break the rules of the game is packed off to siberia
8163027 weapons procurement virtually came to a halt in the 1990s
8163028 and is only slowly reviving readiness and morale remain low and draft evasion and desertion are widespread
8163029 to discover clear patterns in the working of twenty first century global affairs the u s in particular but also other powers is uncertain of its place in the world wars are being fought in faraway places against enemies with no name in a world where governments find it difficult to put forward a coherent security strategy or to formulate their geo political interests a re run of the cold war seems like an attractive proposition compared to the messy world we live in the cold war appears to some to have been a stable and at least comprehensible interlude
8163030 russia had a relatively free hand to do what it did in georgia
8163031 and there was nothing that the u s or anyone else for that matter was going to do about it in a unipolar world there is only one sphere of influence the whole world is the u s s sphere of influence russias ability to carve any sphere of influence effectively ends unipolarity if there ever was such a moment
8163032 nonpolarity a world dominated not by one or two or even several states but rather by dozens of actors possessing and exercising various kinds of power
8163033 they will cooperate on some issues and resist on others there will be a premium on consultation and coalition building and on a diplomacy that encourages cooperation when possible and shields such cooperation from the fallout of inevitable disagreements the united states will no longer have the luxury of a youre either with us or against us foreign policy
8163034 western thinkers assumed the west would never need to make geopolitical compromises it could dictate terms now it must recognise reality the combined western population in north america the european union and australasia is 700m about 10 per cent of the worlds population the remaining 90 per cent have gone from being objects of world history to subjects
8163035 is whether its primary challenge comes from the islamic world or china
8163036 if it is the islamic world the u s should stop intruding into russias geopolitical space and work out a long term engagement with china if it is china the u s must win over russia and the islamic world and resolve the israel palestine issue this will enable islamic governments to work more closely with the west in the battle against al qaeda

8163044 without any supporting judicial precedent whatsoever and indeed in the face of supreme court case law that effectively forecloses the basis for the assertion of absolute immunity here it is difficult to see how the executive can demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on appeal or even that a serious legal question is presented
8163045 there is a very strong possibility that the committee will be unable to complete its investigation before congress expires that may leave important public concerns regarding the nations federal criminal justice system unaddressed

8163070 i think well be able to strengthen legislation and apply bandaid solutions to give us breathing space but ultimately if you want to preserve koalas and everything we value such as less crowded beaches and roads then the population has to be stabilised
8163071 i am concerned that the state government is trying to manipulate the national strategy by being seen to be doing something about the dire state of koalas in queensland
8163072 ive read 700 post mortems of urban koalas and i can tell you a lot of these koalas are simply starving to death
8163073 the declaration overnight by russian president dmitry medvedev i dont believe is a helpful contribution indeed some may regard that as provocative
8163074 australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and our ongoing position is that we believe that russia should abide by the ceasefire effected through the european union and french president nicolas sarkozy and return its forces to the positions they occupied on august 6 and 7
8163075 of course we are still analysing the full purport of this latest development

8163079 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
8163080 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
8163081 we are essentially mimicking what happens in the body when scavenger cells remove dead and abnormal cells if the dead cells are not removed then this affects how healthy cells behave

8163090 faptul ca voronin a fost chemat la soci la intalnirea cu medvedev exact in ziua in care parlamentul rus vota recunoasterea regiunilor separatiste din georgia este foarte sugestiv si demonstreaza ca rusia doreste sa impuna in republica moldova o reglementare in stilul sau cred ca in scurt timp putem sa ne asteptam la un kozak ii
8163091 sper ca autoritatile de la chisinau au inteles ca trebuie sa se astepte la un nou plan kozak si ca vor fi capabile sa i tina piept

8163112 today s announcement by president dmitry medvedev that russia will recognise south ossetia and abkhazia is unjustifiable and unacceptable

8163128 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
8163129 when i saw his face i realised this man sought help
8163130 i told him to hold tight and drove about 500m before stopping to let him off
8163131 i dont know cape town well enough to just drive to a police station i phoned my office to let them know and decided to drive to the parliament where i knew there were police
8163132 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8163133 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8163134 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor

8163138 but if you are doing this regularly then you are significantly increasing your risk of bowel cancer which is one of the most common cancers in the uk
8163139 only a third of people are aware of the link between processed meat and cancer this is not a question of all or nothing because the more processed meat you eat the greater your risk
8163140 obviously you never get the top speed and they vary with distance from the base station and interference
8163141 this was a deliberate attempt to murder police officers this takes events to another level
8163142 i had been on the news condemning the attacks on police officers
8163143 there is no doubt in my mind that it was specifically me who was attacked and targeted because they waited until i had walked away until i came under attack
8163144 what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder stop it now before someone is killed
8163145 many of those brought to us suffered nose and ear pain as the pressure in the cabin was lost
8163146 the ear injuries were then aggravated by the swift loss of altitude those brought to us had severe headaches nosebleeds and damaged eardrums
8163147 most were also suffering from shock but thankfully they are all expected to make a full recovery
8163148 suddenly there was a roar of wind a rush of cold air the oxygen masks dropped you didnt know what was going on
8163149 you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft
8163150 it was incredibly cold my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
8163151 he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
8163152 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating
8163153 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8163154 i was surprised there seemed to be no communication between the pilot and the flight attendants because they didnt seem to know what to say and do
8163155 there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear
8163156 thumping noise then a rush of very cold air through the cabin people began shouting out in fear
8163157 when something like that happens people obviously think they are going to die
8163158 everyone began reaching for their masks babies started crying people clung on to each other some were being sick it was a truly frightening moment
8163159 passengers sometimes misunderstand they expect a surge of oxygen when in actual fact there is a steady stream of oxygen
8163160 the oxygen masks were working and the correct procedures were followed as soon as the captain got the plane down to 8 000ft he did make the appropriate announcement that they were going to divert to limoges for safety reasons
8163161 this is always a traumatic experience for passengers but the crew dealt with it appropriately

8163168 the court will deny the executives request for a stay
8163169 hence the executive should respond to the document aspect of the subpoenas by producing non privileged material and identifying more specifically the materials it is withholding on a claim of executive privilege
8163170 it is on ms mierss appearance that the dispute principally focuses this decision should not however foreclose the parties continuing attempts to reach a negotiated solution both sides indicated that discussions regarding an accommodation have resumed
8163171 has failed to demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the absolute immunity issue or that it has even raised a question
8163172 the executives argument boils down to a claim that a stay is appropriate because the underlying issue is important
8163173 but that is beside the point and does not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success or a substantial appellate issue hence the court concludes that this prong of the stay pending appeal analysis cuts strongly in favor of the committee

8163177 we want to learn from what beijing has done and also from the chinese companies who successfully supported the beijing organising committee for the olympic games
8163178 we believe the experience of chinese companies serving the beijing games will give them a head start in bidding for the opportunities in the 2012 games
8163179 think londons goal is to encourage as many chinese companies to choose london as their gateway to globalisation london already receives more chinese investment than any other city in europe
8163180 we will visit chinese construction technology software companies and so on to encourage them to bid for the opportunities connected with the 2012 games

8163212 news about the conflict should be broadcast without restrictions on media outlets or reporters in the field
8163213 the entire world is witness to the fact that kashmir movement is purely indigenous peaceful and it was intensified by the economic blockade the massive gathering at eidgah proved that people of kashmir would continue the struggle for their birthright of self determination
8163214 curbing media is part of pressure tactics applied to stop media from reporting the present situation
8163215 the world knows that people of kashmir have launched a peaceful movement
8163216 new delhi is trying to suppress the present movement with force people turning in lakhs to attend the pro freedom rallies should serve as an eye opener for india

8163218 players with very little experience at the top level are criticising someone whose contribution to indian tennis is legendary leander had a talk with me he didnt want to go through that embarrassment once again and decided to step down
8163219 there was a time when the amritrajs and the krishnans did not see eye to eye as the then india coach i saw it from close quarters but they didnt make the spat public
8163220 see our resource is limited we didnt have a big pool to choose from still the aita had given the players an ultimatum but leander chose to quit in the interest of indian tennis
8163221 lots of people were interested for the post some very big names we have given him the job to avoid controversy romania would be a very tough proposition on clay whoever is the captain
8163222 in any case leander will play only in the doubles knowing him his intensity wont drop
8163223 i must say the moldovan had the best defence among all the boxers in beijing he never dropped his guard during the bout
8163224 on the other hand akhil is a very fearless boxer and he plays with his guards down but thats his style technically there was no problem
8163225 he is a very emotional person and was really affected by the quarterfinal loss but put up a brave face to keep the spirits up in the camp he said so what if i have lost jitender and vijender have to accomplish the task and he kept himself upbeat for them
8163226 he always had the confidence and he now has the required experience and that made all the difference
8163227 itll be very small probably about 20 or 30 people

8163241 our supporters have not had a lot to shout about in the eight or nine years they have been out of the premier league but i think it is important that we get to christmas and if were in the top 12 we need to set a target to be pushing the guys
8163242 we had a great start by winning our first three games and we were disappointing against bristol city but we took a step forward with the way we handled ourselves
8163243 we are competing for points in the league when we go to doncaster on saturday and we have to show what we did in the second 45 minutes for the whole game against doncaster
8163244 it is a bitter sweet result because we have lost and were out of the cup but on the back of a bad result against bristol city i thought they bounced back and i was delighted with that
8163245 in the second half we were better than the first and we created problems for them after our equaliser we thought it was going to be our night but it wasnt to be
8163246 gunnarssons long throw put pressure on newcastle and scott dann is able to get on the end of set pieces it was the best time for us to score
8163247 when we were 2 0 down and we scored at the end of the first half and scored at the end of the second half that showed great determination
8163248 in the first half we had a bit of a lesson in passing and we were not in their faces enough
8163249 we began to look more confident and we got back into the game
8163250 then kevin brings on michael owen and he showed his value and that he is one of the best strikers in the world he has shown that again tonight
8163251 we had chances in extratime and we forced some great saves from shay given we hit the bar and elliott will be disappointed that he didnt score because he got himself in a dangerous position
8163252 we are keen to hear from anyone who saw mr teasdale either in the barnes meadow area of northampton or a little later when he was near the texaco station at thurlaston on the a45 near rugby

8163257 never lifted my head just one picture next picture i did that for 10 years and at the end of the 10 years i was a player all over the place
8163258 get stuck in some series playing a certain type and if theyre doing that two years later they havent had a chance to try different things and if you go from picture to picture youre almost forced to do that
8163259 you had to become very open in your brain in your thinking so there was nothing in your sense of who you are that you objected to im sitting here talking to you and if i saw little slivers of my movies i would remember that i was a hairdresser a boxer a female impersonator a viking a trapeze artist
8163260 i had to mentally psych myself so that when i put on those clothes that wardrobe i believed it and everybody else started to believe it
8163261 i see you spend all your time on the computer why dont you help me out with this
8163262 i hear your a big computer geek can you help me with vista
8163263 oh well i thought you said you knew stuff about computers
8163264 theres this site you may have heard of called google
8163265 and it is a really useful tool to find out whats wrong with your computer just type the problem in to the bar and go from there
8163266 never seen it before but google has the answers to everything if you have issues just google it
8163267 we dont have much to gain from it japan is very tough on its agricultural tariffs and jpepa needs a multilateral deal not just an agreement between two countries
8163268 it should be beneficial and not just fashionable to the country
8163269 we all know that japan is incapable of producing young fresh and capable laborers in the next 10 years they will have a very aging labor force and without relocating to the philippines it will never survive economic competition
8163270 we negotiated but we did not get what we wanted
8163271 these are exactly the same commitments japan made under the world trade organization wto and there is no added provision in the jpepa there is nothing new in concession granted in the jpepa
8163272 we must determine the direction of where our country is going the direction is not being determined by our leaders but by external forces
8163273 this means that if we dont improve our production dont be surprised if japanese manufacturers here simply close shop and just import all their products
8163274 nagbobolahan lang tayo ditto we are just kidding each other here
8163275 jpepa is silent on fishery subsidies which endangers the livelihood of fishermen and puts at risk local agricultural stock

8163278 the completion of the bmi probe is just the initial step to bring justice to the victims of this latest sea tragedy involving sulpicio marina must now make sure that bmis recommendation to keep its vessels grounded is strictly enforced and for proper authorities to pursue administrative civil and criminal charges against the shipping line and others equally responsible
8163279 even the long due retrieval of the ships toxic cargo including endosulfan and bunker fuel as well as the remaining dead bodies inside the vessel wont start until september 1 so the governments softening up on sulpicio is really bothering
8163280 i love you baby if its alright i love you baby you are in heaven i love you baby
8163281 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8163282 and whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8163283 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8163284 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8163285 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8163286 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever because he thinks americans overall are better off thanks to president bush
8163287 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home
8163288 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8163289 over the last eight years your lives are less secure those are the facts and john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did
8163290 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8163291 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8163292 everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8163293 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8163294 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8163295 and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8163296 not ready 08 a mile high and an inch deep
8163297 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president of the united states of america
8163298 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8163299 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8163300 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8163301 were in turmoil in math i have great faith in our new standards
8163302 may show that travelers are starting to respond to the recent drop in gasoline prices
8163303 running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to find the money to mount an offer
8163304 if we focus only on television ads we would be dead
8163305 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plans are the billions of dollars hes promising in more tax cuts to oil companies and the only thing that hell recycle is the same failed george bush approach to energy policy
8163306 meanwhile exxon had the largest quarterly profit in the history of the world
8163307 hes not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8163308 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8163309 and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy soundbite
8163310 and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they had been long familiar they thought her prodigiously stupid
8163311 and it is not very wonderful that with all their promising talents and early information they should be entirely deficient in the less common acquirements of self knowledge generosity and humility in everything but disposition they were admirably taught

8163335 over the past 15 years middle england has had it good but now they are feeling the squeeze during the good times they have got used to borrowing money and having easy access to credit based on the mentality they should take on a lot of borrowing because their house prices will keep growing
8163336 it is these groups that are really now having to tighten their belts as they find commissions and overtime gets cut worryingly it is going to get a lot worse before it gets better
8163337 to create controversy or to make political statements let alone to offend significant members of our community w ere trying to find entertainment that reaches across all ages and backgrounds

8163340 nearly three in 10 voters 29 percent pointed to mccain as the candidate running a negative campaign compared to just 5 percent who said obama is running a negative campaign
8163341 mitt romney stood up and vetoed in state tuition for illegal aliens opposed drivers licenses for illegals mike huckabee supported in state tuition benefits for illegal immigrants huckabee even supported taxpayer funded scholarships for illegal aliens
8163342 the ad says romneys record as governor of massachusetts includes no executions thats true but the reason is that massachusetts doesnt have a death penalty furthermore romney tried and failed to get the death penalty reinstated
8163343 we would have to close our doors there is no way we could survive

8163345 the elected representatives in iran to meet with members of the united states congress
8163346 we had one overt policy which was one of negotiation and confidence building and a covert policy which was continuation of activities
8163347 during our negotiations and so long as we were not subjected to sanctions we could import technology we should have negotiated for so long and benefited from the atmosphere of negotiations to the extent we could import all the technology needed
8163348 iran has been intensifying aspects of its lethal support for select groups of iraqi shia militants
8163349 i voted against the amendment to designate irans revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization because i dont trust this administration
8163350 this senator biden correctly says israel could not suppress hizbullah in lebanon so how can the u s stand face to face with a nation of 70 million this is the blessing of the guardianship of the jurists the theocracy which plants such thoughts in the hearts of u s senators and forces them to make such confessions
8163351 senator perata is not going to do any in depth interviews until the budget is resolved
8163352 we are at a delicate place in negotiations given our hope to get a deal before the end of session
8163353 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8163354 and what i know is over the centuries the doctrines of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins

8163618 ultimately what i really want to happen this is my dream is that i make enough money from torpedo comics to not need to play music for money
8163619 illegally i might add but we paid our taxes we worked we were never a burden on society
8163620 it was pretty normal to hear bombs going off gunfights in the streets that type of stuff
8163621 when youre the victim of a genocide you hold onto what you have with both hands
8163622 but when people signal i dont care whats happening ill let them in its called courtesy and courtesys lost to a lot of people
8163623 the only intention i had was to devastate the set that they did before us and thats precisely what we did we annihilated that stage
8163624 when it comes to the sonics of the album i leave that to daron
8163625 personally it makes no difference to me where i record because i dont listen to it in that way
8163626 at this point im so comfortable in the studio its really not a big deal generally speaking i go in there with a mission and get out as quickly as possible
8163627 just about everything on the scars on broadway album is a one take run through
8163628 if the musics playing with me theres no necessity for a click
8163629 even though theres tempo changes and variance id rather just play it and have the feel be expressed
8163630 to be honest with you i havent gotten a whole lot of phone calls saying come play on our album
8163631 i dont know if its because my style is not something that suits a lot of people or maybe they think i wouldnt do it or whatever but i just havent gotten that many requests
8163632 system of a down is always going to be the mothership for us
8163633 but the bottom line is weve had some artistic differences and ill tell you exactly why its very simple daron was writing the majority of the songs on the album on a consistent basis and serj tankian lead vocals really had a lot of songs that he wanted to get out to the fans of system but we looked at it in a very democratic way the best songs for the album got on the album it just so happened that a lot of darons vibe fit a lot better and that wasnt necessarily fair to serj
8163634 and we had that same relationship in system also i handle a lot of the bands business i handle a lot of the merchandising i handle a lot of the radio interviews i handle a lot of the press im the band psychologist
8163635 i try to make it as carefree as possible for daron to concentrate on what he does best which is write songs produce the band and think of only the artistic elements of the music thats all i want him to be thinking about and i try to do the best i can to facilitate that for him and the benefit that i get is that he comes up with these songs and theyre amazing songs i cant write songs well i could but youre not going to want to hear em
8163636 were both kind of alpha males born three days apart so we have a lot of similarities
8163637 and when youre younger those similarities can be a burden when youre older you make more sense out of things so now we get along unbelievably well weve gotten into fistfights before
8163638 its a fond memory for us and we laugh about it

8163640 every band that has sustained the test of time has done that
8163641 if you look at the chili peppers u2 metallica theyve all taken time off maybe they havent done other projects but theyve taken time off to become self aware again because at a certain point youre no longer john dolmayan youre john from system of a down and that gets irritating after a while because i was a person before system existed and i dont want to lose track of that
8163642 are you gonna throw your drum sticks into the audience
8163643 im aggressive in my playing style theres a lot of anxiety in my playing its anxious to get to the next part next beat whatever im in pretty good physical shape but it is taxing
8163644 it was just too boring so my practice was always putting on albums if i couldnt play what they were doing i would play it until i could
8163645 i think id be nervous as f k if that happened
8163646 i love the fact that im behind my drum kit and i have that place to hide and i can just be myself back there and do my thing i dont know if solos are so boring to me that i dont want to do it yeah the drummers out there will be amped but what about the other people that are sitting there thats when people go to get beers
8163647 i dont think you should create art for the masses
8163648 you should create art for yourself and if the masses accept it great and if they dont thats okay too i have just as much respect for someone who hates my music as for someone who loves it because at least its a strong reaction either way both opinions are equally meaningless for me though in the scope of things because nothings going to prevent me from doing what i have to do

8163673 terima penghargaan itu karena itu sebuah pengakuan yang terhormat tetapi kembalikan hadiahnya karena lima milyar itu sudah membuat banyak orang merasa dirinya begitu miskin sehingga mereka mengaum meminta kamu menolaknya
8163674 ya aku mengingin penghargaan itu karena mereka sudah memberikannya dan aku juga menginginkan duit 5 milyar itu sebab aku memang berhak mendapatkannya aku sama sekali tidak tertarik menjadi pahlawan sebab aku manusia biasa aku tetap akan menerima sebab aku berhak menjadi diriku
8163675 the ranch is a patchwork of blocks with different aspects and exposures each having a distinct vinous voice it is my challenge to coax them to sing in unison i have always been awed by the distinctive character and power of the fruit from this ranch

8163684 it gives you a belief that when you find yourself in those certain important moments when you just need to come up with something good and something special and just try to be calm and hold your nerves
8163685 thats what happens when you have experience with winning grand slams thats why roger and rafa are so dominant and they look so good on the court when they have important moments
8163686 were going to start clark and probably play devlin for sure some
8163687 clarks had a little bit more experience hes had a good spring practice and a really good preseason but i dont want him looking over his shoulder
8163688 hes got to go in and play take over the team and well go from there
8163689 he played a big role in the alamo bowl last year and did pretty well then
8163690 both of them can run the same offense but their strengths are different
8163691 the coaching staff will have to adjust accordingly and put the formations in according to their strengths
8163692 pats more comfortable in the pocket hes kind of the rollout guy making some plays happen on the edge darylls more of a get him out of the pocket guy and let him make plays he cant stay in the pocket and make all the throws we need him to make hes more deadly moving around doing options
8163693 when they bury me are they going to put on my gravestone youre one more ahead of bobby bowden i dont think bobby would feel any different than i do
8163694 odrick hadnt had a lot of practice until this last week koroma and ogbu both really got better and better and i think they deserve to start
8163695 there is still a relatively large gap between china and the best in the world in the high profile items like athletics swimming and cycling and also in the popular ball sports
8163696 also we have already mined our full potential in our strong sports at beijing only through widening our gold winning face can we adapt to the fierce competition in future
8163697 these problems require earnest reflection to build courage from shame and to make up lost ground
8163698 as soon as we step off the podium everything starts from zero
8163699 the break came at a really good time because i thought we were exhausted
8163700 like most teams in the league we had so many players come in from overseas at the start of the season and they were exhausted
8163701 didnt really go anywhere tropical or sunny just kind of kept it quiet for myself not really tried to do too much
8163702 we just have been working on defensively keeping the ball in front of us working on our schemes and then offensively just tightening up some things
8163703 i thought we started out playing good d and as the season progresses you really dont have practice time theres been some slippage we just want to get back to doing things the right way
8163704 were in a good position ending the season off so we have to come back ready to go and i think were ready to do that
8163705 things have started to pick back up and were starting to get back on track
8163706 we used to trade through the dabba only last diwali did we get this guy opening shop and i thought i would take the legal route and opened an account with him i never thought it would lead to this
8163707 big officers sit in bse why did they let the scrip go to rs 55 000 the trade was suspended at 12 noon and closing price was fixed at rs 5 216 but our client has been issued an auction slip of rs 2 2 lakh rs 55 000 per share our limits have been blocked this is unfair
8163708 we have a card but the trade was executed through the sub broker the screen clearly asks for a confirmation of the trade its his duty to tell the client why do we pay him
8163709 i am a broker how can i take responsibility for what the client is doing if he traded he has to bear the losses i have no way but to pass it on
8163710 in our village we compromise and settle such disputes please let me know if i can get out of this some how i am ready to pay the closing price of rs 5 216 but why should i pay ten times
8163711 in an online setup when a share is bought the system checks whether there is sufficient cash in the account to buy similarly on sale the system checks whether there is any share lying in the sellers account but in an offline scenario it is the dealers duty to say no if he carelessly or willingly does mischief then the system will take its own course unless the entire trade is cancelled there is no way out
8163712 on the day kgn resumed trading after a seven year gap the scrip opened at rs 55 and went up to rs 55 000 so there was volatility and people were trying to take their chances and the brokers were penalised usually when such relistings happen we keep the position limit as zero on all systems and all orders have to be done through head office at mumbai only yet occasionally some scrips get missed and we had to pay penalty for sylph technologies but we debited the account of the mischief maker who had placed a buy order at rs 11 when the going price was rs 1 000
8163713 the penalty is on the broker ideally he is not supposed to pass it on
8163714 we used to trade through the dabba only last diwali did we get this guy opening shop and i thought i would take the legal route and opened an account with him i never thought it would lead to this
8163715 big officers sit in bse why did they let the scrip go to rs 55 000 the trade was suspended at 12 noon and closing price was fixed at rs 5 216 but our client has been issued an auction slip of rs 2 2 lakh rs 55 000 per share our limits have been blocked this is unfair

8163721 the penalty is on the broker ideally he is not supposed to pass it on
8163722 it was a massive victory because we have qualified to play in the asian cup the biggest tournament in asian football
8163723 it changes things for us because now you get to play with the biggest teams
8163724 ive worked with so many coaches but he is a complete manager from technical training to managing players
8163725 it is up to us the system to give good players
8163726 players have to be absolutely intelligent and not look at the finance alone as they sometimes do
8163727 he can be a real boost if he continues to pitch that way
8163728 my goal for the last month is just be consistent
8163729 his balls surprising hes got some zip hes learned to throw breaking balls we saw him a few years ago when we rule 5d him and you know what hes come a long way as a pitcher he kind of shut us down
8163730 thats who he is what he does for a living they wanted to give him a little break in that situation tomorrow or any other time j j will be in there
8163731 i know he wanted to pitch but we have to take care of him for the future
8163732 i dont know how many i have in the minors its probably up there a little bit the first one here thats a good feeling
8163733 theres a lot of new young faces to get to know
8163734 but you know me im going to be me and have fun what can be more fun and more exciting than being in the pennant race with your old team
8163735 i think the human element umpires bring to a game is great
8163736 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8163737 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8163738 it was a lousy night we pretty much screwed it up every way you can screw it up
8163739 hes the best player in the league unfortunately he had a bad night
8163740 something personal about my family i dont deal well with that thats enough right there
8163741 well if you were a great project manager you wouldnt have to ask that question
8163742 oh yes why didnt i see this before this is so obvious
8163743 this student took ap calculus but theres no geometry here rejection
8163744 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8163745 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
8163746 there are cancelations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this
8163747 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
8163748 the petro dictators will never own american wind and sunshine
8163749 the government orders the population to take precautions because this storm will bring a lot of rain
8163750 theres no rain and wind the sky is clear cars are traveling everywhere i dont think theres a hurricane
8163751 i never expected it to flower it was an experiment i wanted a tropical looking garden
8163752 i planted three different species and wrap them up in the winter to keep off the frost the climate is definitely getting warmer last year i did not have to wrap them up nearly as much and they still kept growing
8163753 we have had one that has flowered in a very sheltered position in the botanic garden and clare college had one flower about two years ago
8163754 it is certainly related to the differing weather conditions we are seeing the aerial parts of the plants are surviving the winters before they would be cut back down to ground level in winter i think it is something that is probably becoming more and more common in the southern half of the country
8163755 it will start to produce fruits like small bananas i have never tried one but i would expect them not to be particularly edible they will probably have large seeds in them
8163756 people have said to me that i am too soft and too nice and that i always look at the good in people and that i have put myself in situations where i have left myself open to allegations against me
8163757 i never committed rape and i never ever sexually assaulted either of these boys
8163758 in the eyes of the law i have done no wrong i am not guilty in any way
8163759 in the eyes of the church i have committed grievous sins and i have been hounded out because of my confessions
8163760 we are very concerned about this its not as if were short on traffic at the moment
8163761 if the a14 upgrade has not been completed in time northstowe should not happen if lorries were not allowed on the a14 they would go on to the minor roads
8163762 as she approached the junction at about 20 miles an hour she veered off to the right and into the museum to stop herself going across the junction with magdalene street it was quick thinking and it was lucky no one was hurt she assessed the situation pretty swiftly which was very impressive
8163763 she was shocked but she wasnt too bad the museum looked like it had had it
8163764 i am trying to push forward with getting the permanent repair work done as quickly as possible
8163765 the museum is going to have to remain closed to the public but it is not going to keel over staff will still be able to continue working in the newer part of the building
8163766 it is absolutely hilarious how the sun reported a potential record deal with emi
8163767 it is rubbish just like the rumours we are taking part in a reality tv show
8163768 things have been good since our tv appearance but that would just be taking things to extreme levels
8163769 the response from the public since getting our name out there has been awesome and we have been working on promoting our tour and the album
8163770 the money from dragons den is going on the album which will be out hopefully early next year
8163771 we also have a new single coming out in february
8163772 the whole situation is horrendous rather than focusing on the need of the client when i drive to a job i find myself thinking about parking spaces traffic wardens and fare penalties
8163773 in many areas in cambridge mill road and side streets coming off of mill road for example there is not a chance you will find a residential bay to park in
8163774 i have to search for another residential space which could take me anything from 10 minutes to an hour which in an emergency is just not possible
8163775 the other option is to park illegally and hope a traffic warden does not pass but i am not willing to get fined
8163776 i have had to pay parking fines out of my wages
8163777 it was an emergency and i needed to park somewhere so i parked outside the home on a single yellow line the whole parking policy makes me sick
8163778 key workers who provide a valuable service cannot go about their jobs without fear of getting a parking ticket so they go out in pairs
8163779 it is a crazy waste of public money and the city council needs to look at this policy
8163780 the consequence of these actions will be that horningsea will have no bus service at all
8163781 we were approached by a number of councillors from the area and they arranged a meeting with the councils transport team about running a service through horningsea
8163782 we said we would run it for six months but we were sceptical it would be commercially viable the commercial viability is somewhat of a disaster
8163783 to give people the service they want would increase costs by probably 100 per cent
8163784 at the same time it was announced that some subsidised services were at risk i understand the complaints from horningsea but if a bus service is provided and nobody uses it it will be at risk
8163785 no one likes to make the tough decisions to reduce or withdraw any bus service
8163786 we are in a horrible position of having to make savings to fund other services the council provides
8163787 however we feel the system we have used to assess our subsidised services makes this system as fair as possible looking at cost social need and whether there are alternative services
8163788 i will be appealing against the decision made by officials as i believe they havent taken into account what changes have taken place
8163789 theres no objection on this as i had a lot of personal issues to deal with at the time
8163790 our commitment to residents and local officials shows we are doing everything possible but none of this has been taken into account i believe

8163807 but he also had a tilt to his pelvis and some back pain his symptoms were very similar to whiplash
8163808 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8163809 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8163810 is this helping me to get me out of debt
8163811 when painful thoughts visit one should immediately try to supplant those with some neutral or nonsensical thought such as a pink elephant or red rose or repetition of a word like dig dig dig
8163812 but he also had a tilt to his pelvis and some back pain his symptoms were very similar to whiplash
8163813 weve kind of hit one of those plateaus and we have to re energize

8163823 what did fresh fire ministries know and when did they know it im talking about todd bentleys marriage which is in shambles according to the statement posted on the fresh fire website it would appear that the board of directors have known for quite sometime
8163824 undoubtedly the pressures and the burden of the outpouring which approaches 144 days on august 23rd have helped to create an atmosphere of fatigue and stress that has exacerbated existing issues in their relationship emphasis added
8163825 what we are seeing in the so called lakeland revival did not come like a rushing mighty wind out of heaven cf
8163826 there can be no denying that bentley is a direct result of the so called kansas city prophets he himself defers directly to two of these prophets openly in spite of the moral collapses of both of them bentley calls a bob jones a mentor and a seer jones had to leave the ministry after having to confess to using his prophetic office to disrobe women but to bentley jones is a spiritual father it was jones teaching that encouraged false prophecies in the church by encouraging young prophets that they need not be 100 accurate and that it was a good thing that the accuracy was so low otherwise there would be a whole lot of ananiass and saphirras
8163827 het eerste doelpunt zal belangrijk worden wij proberen die goal te maken
8163828 na afloop van de eerste wedstrijd realiseerden de spelers dat ze de kans hadden arsenal te verslaan
8163829 ze hadden meer uit de wedstrijd kunnen halen de teleurstelling overheerste toen toch was het team ook trots op het vertoonde spel
8163830 de klus is nog niet geklaard ik eis van mijn team dat ze scherp beginnen tegen twente het gevaar is dat we er te makkelijk over gaan denken daar moeten we voor waken

8163832 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses

8163840 we are committed to the safe care and custody of our detainees
8163841 we are also committed to releasing them when they are no longer a security threat
8163842 this is the nineteenth cache weve found before this cache we found another cache that was rockets but this one was also a big cache

8163848 there is no escaping the unfortunate fact that muslim government employees in law enforcement the military and the diplomatic corps need to be watched for connections to terrorism
8163849 so as people in diyala assist security forces in rooting out terrorists and criminals in their neighborhoods the government is helping people by allocating funds to restore services and creating opportunities for the people to improve their lives
8163850 over the past 18 months we have seen time and again in iraq that security is sustainable with support and service from the people
8163851 part of the success of the partnership between iraqi and coalition forces has been our ability to live close to the people and provide them with immediate and urgent help
8163852 indeed the success in diyala has been heavily driven by the local populace rejecting the violence of al qaida in iraqs ideology supporting the enforcement of law and the mutual collaboration between the people in diyala province and the iraqi security forces
8163853 we visited the people of diyala and the local authorities to discuss the security situation reconstruction and reconciliation
8163854 during the visit the delegation assembled the immediate and long term needs of the people and began discussions on how the government can best use the 100 million allocated to meet the needs of the people
8163855 so as people in diyala assist security forces in rooting out terrorists and criminals in their neighborhoods the government is helping people by allocating funds to restore services and creating opportunities for the people to improve their lives
8163856 just as security improvements have taken time and sacrifice so will the improvements in services and economic development
8163857 in my name and your local ip sons names we are promising god and our country to protect our citizens respect and obey the law and stop all the violations

8163883 russias decision today confirms that its invasion of georgia was part of a broader premeditated plan to redraw the map of europe
8163884 the russian federations actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation the nation of georgia
8163885 this is not the end of the story in georgia
8163886 russia wants to aggravate rather than calm down passions this is an extremely alarming development

8163912 i was out on post checks when i met airman mohiadeen
8163913 i noticed his name and asked where he was from and he said baghdad
8163914 i think its really cool to see people who have immigrated to the united states serving their country especially when it means coming back to their homeland
8163915 we will not leave our peacekeepers and russian citizens unprotected
8163916 heavy weapons and artillery have been sent there and tanks have been added
8163917 deaths and injuries have been reported including among russian peacekeepers its all very sad and alarming and of course there will be a response
8163918 russian georgian relations have deteriorated to the point that some kremlin officials are seriously weighing a military operation which they hope will hand georgia a military defeat and topple president saakashivili
8163919 its springtime a time to start a war with georgia
8163920 saakashvili is out of control and needs to be brought to heel
8163921 if georgians keep quiet and behave we may even tolerate their joining nato but if they are loud well take measures
8163922 if iran strikes first or if israel must launch a pre emptive strike against iran who would you rather have as commander in chief a diplomat like tzipi livni or a military man like me
8163923 his political zigzagging was evident when he joined kadima a mere 48 hours after announcing to the world that the likud was his political home forever and ever or when he fiercely objected to the construction of the security fence only to take charge of the operation or when it came time to vote on the gaza pullout where he turned from one of the moves most adamant opponents to one of its most enthused advocates almost overnight

8163929 all i ever wanted was choice i think in this day and age everyone should be entitled to their own choice it nagle is a fine school with an excellent curriculum
8163930 the school has been very accommodating she has a key for her own bathroom and she has her own changing room
8163931 islam has created and unleashed an uncontrollable wave of hatred and rage on the world going forward we must realize that the portent behind the terrorist attacks is the purest form of what the prophet mohammed created its not radical islam its what islam is at the core the time of moderation and watered down religion is over its not radical islam its not wahhabi islam its mohammeds original islam
8163932 reviving the caliphate one world nation under allah supersizing the muslim world
8163933 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plans are the billions of dollars hes promising in more tax cuts to oil companies and the only thing that hell recycle is the same failed george bush approach to energy policy
8163934 meanwhile exxon had the largest quarterly profit in the history of the world
8163935 hes not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8163936 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer

8163938 the recovery shows that a massive explosion was on the cards
8163939 india needs azadi from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
8163940 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
8163941 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate

8163953 it was a hugely emotional challenge to go through this separation
8163954 it was something we had imposed on us we got involved with people who had a whole different perception about marketing and business thekla and i have our own personal philosophy based on sustainability it was very challenging for us we were being asked to compromise our own values but now looking back it has allowed me personally to focus on the quality of grapes coming from this region
8163955 its been a huge and amazing transition and thankfully we dont have to have partners
8163956 ive learned this be true to yourself and without compromise while being respectful of other points of view its pretty exciting once again

8163978 i think one of the things i love about gossip girl is that its not just preppy its super preppy
8163979 a cropped skinny jean or a high waisted 70s jean but it depends on what your body type is
8163980 i bet serena will wear a lot of chunky jewelry because she always wears those simple tees with a pair of skinny jeans and boots
8163981 truthfully that generation the 14 to 18 year olds have kind of taken over
8163982 its all about them the consumer trends the music anywhere from the general trends on the street really gets translated into what women are wearing
8163983 im pretty confident that designers are looking at it its like theyre young beautiful and rich thats totally what those designers are designing for
8163984 a lot of denim high waisted denim and it had the influence of this super chic young girl upper east side that is very elite and privileged
8163985 i just saw a zara window that is totally imitating chuck bass looks from upcoming episodes that have been previewed on the web
8163986 blair is moving in a very art deco feel mirroring the paintings of tamara de lempicka
8163987 and serena feels like a austrian painter gustav klimt to me chuck bass played by ed westwick as a young sean connery circa hitchcocks marnie
8163988 its unbelievable to me how the headband has made a resurgence
8163989 it goes with the whole preppy thing especially i think you see that on blair
8163990 the deep purple plum color family is really really strong for fall
8163991 what i hope that teens watching the show will come away with as far as fashion inspiration is freedom to experiment with proportion color and texture
8163992 jenny is the downtown girl but she doesnt have the money to wear the expensive clothes so she remakes them in her own cool way
8163993 like youre going to see a giant hair bow on blair or youre going to see a micro something
8163994 skinny skinny jeans skinny jacket a cool t shirt underneath
8163995 keputusan pilihan raya umum kecil permatang pauh sudah diketahui dan keputusannya berpihak kepada datuk seri anwar ibrahim

8163997 ive visited north korea in 1999 2004 2005 and then the last time in october 2007 so i can see the dynamic of this change
8163998 in 1999 even in pyongyang people were exhausted malnourished feeble in 2004 the situation was very different the whole city looked like one big market
8163999 there was activity everywhere on streets under the bridges from the windows of apartments
8164000 there have been a lot of changes but they are very patchy its still not a transitional economy
8164001 certain segments or layers are allowed to adopt some market driven mechanisms but the majority of the economy is being artificially preserved
8164002 its the level of specificity in the ideology thats the problem for reform
8164003 if your guiding principles were vague and adaptable it would be easier but in north korea they have official guidelines on how to do proper ostrich farming how can you now say in fact thats not the right way to do ostrich farming
8164004 north koreans were taught their whole lives that the state would provide now they have to take care of themselves
8164005 a mistake of just one word can lead a north korean to be publicly executed in this society
8164006 it is impossible to resist publicly the regime the control and suppression are beyond our imagination slaughter is still being carried out in north korea
8164007 social entrepreneurs and leading nonprofit organizations that are assisting schools lifting families out of poverty filling health care gaps and inspiring others to lead change in their own communities
8164008 targeting national reconciliation the political process and democracy in the country
8164009 the human rights council at the united nations has now banned any criticism regarding sharia law and human rights in the islamic world according to president doru romulus costea and following the efforts of delegates from egypt pakistan and iran the council will no longer tolerate criticism of either sharia or specific fatwas in the name of human rights
8164010 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
8164011 the safety and security of the random house building and employees
8164012 a declaration of war explosive stuff a national security issue
8164013 the series of events that torpedoed this novel are a window into how quickly fear stunts intelligent discourse about the muslim world
8164014 one of the guys here joked that focus on the family is praying for the wrong stuff
8164015 recounted carl burroughs of the national weather service in boulder
8164016 together we can form joint companies with pdvsa and that way we can continue providing our experience and knowledge of the business
8164017 at one point i got a good look at her and saw that she was walking on her hands so that brought concern to us
8164018 we went through ins and outs of trying to get it all connected but once we did brad was excited to take the project on and i was excited to be here for it
8164019 this is going to be an amazing experience for all of us
8164020 im looking forward to helping my fellow female police officer and being a part of the positive historic changes occurring here more gt
8164021 it is our religious custom not to touch our women so we cannot search females our female ips will be extremely important to use at checkpoints and government buildings throughout the province
8164022 they will bring fresh ideas to how we conduct business
8164023 but im proud to be a part of this page in kirkuks if not iraqs history
8164024 this is going to be an amazing experience for all of us
8164025 im looking forward to helping my fellow female police officer and being a part of the positive historic changes occurring here
8164026 man or women if you come through our check point we will stop you
8164027 they are not iraqis they are not muslim it is not our way
8164028 the mass violence in the country underscores the chilling fact that the most dangerous place in iraq is not the mosque the marketplace or the military checkpoint but the classroom
8164029 its great that the city was able to get this school opened up
8164030 the school is going to be a wonderful institution not only for the students but for all of ramadi as the youth of the city continue to earn an education they will assist the city and the province in making their country prosperous
8164031 this school will allow young people from all across al anbar to come and learn a trade it also has the added benefit of getting the young males off the streets and giving them something productive to do this school will give them opportunity to become functioning members of society
8164032 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
8164033 never surrender is a phenomenal book by a man of great courage and an inspiring faith boykin takes us with him inside some of the most intriguing special operations in modern american history he explains the magnitude of the threat posed by rogue states and radical leaders who dont simply want to frighten us but to annihilate us i loved every page you will too
8164034 with all your years experience in the pentagon commanding delta force hunting jihadists around the globe
8164035 in your judgment how serious to us national security is the threat of radical islam in the 21stcentury
8164036 when i came into the army in 1971 we were focused on the soviet union
8164037 even though we were fighting in vietnam our real threat was the soviet union but i would say to you joel that the threat that radical islam presents to not only america but to the world today is an even more serious threat than when we were in a nuclear standoff during the cold war and its more concerning to me because this is an enemy that is hard to understand it is an enemy that is easy to ignore and it is an enemy that is absolutely relentless
8164038 well first of all i think that it is very clearly based on their own manifesto that they are adhering to a very radical an extreme interpretation of the quran they clearly believe that infidels infidels defined as those that do not serve allah must either be converted or killed
8164039 i think the worst case scenario is that they continue in their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction
8164040 weapons of mass destruction are available to them now particularly chemical and biological and those are not hard to make but the worst case scenario is i think that they have nuclear capabilities that within these terrorist organizations within the jihadist movement that they intimidate europe to the point that europe is no longer capable of standing against them as they have done historically and that they take their extremism to the entire world and people start to buckle under the intimidation and pressure of really what i would see as a huge islamic movement
8164041 we know that he ahmadinejad has centrifuges spinning we know that he has the technology he has the scientists and he certainly has the determination ahmadinejad is a very very dangerous man in my view i believe that the world should pay close attention to what he has said some would say well thats just rhetoric but lets go back and look at hitlers rhetoric in 1933 and what ultimately occurred
8164042 i think ahmadinejad is far more dangerous than the ayatollah khomeini because given that he now has more resources
8164043 certainly has more money as a result of the oil in iran he has greater weapons capabilities he has a more sophisticated army and military in general and regardless of what the 2007 national intelligence estimate says he is developing nuclear capabilities
8164044 my view is that negotiating with ahmadinejad is a waste of time
8164045 i dont think theres anything that you can appeal to in ahmadinejads view of geopolitics of life in general that would result in any kind of meaningful agreement with the west i think ahmadinejad sees himself as a man who is supposed to hasten the arrival of the mahdi he has even indicated that in his speeches ahmadinejad believes that the madhi will come as a result of his efforts part of which includes destroying or at least subjugating israel and so i think that the threat goes beyond just nuclear weapons i think the threat really is a threat of growing radicalism within iran which is influencing much of the thinking in the rest of the islamic world and ultimately when a man is that driven when a man is that convinced that allah is holding him accountable to do that destroy judeo christian civilization i think to believe that we could negotiate with him in any meaningful way is just inane
8164046 its actually inspired by a swedish film about two lesbians
8164047 theyre teenagers and its a story about them discovering love and how they feel about other girls in school they get teased by the other kids and then they decide f k everyone were going to do this we dont care what you think
8164048 thats what the songs about not caring what other people think about your boyfriend or girlfriend
8164049 its a lot better for us to work on the songs all the time and keep making small changes to them
8164050 we probably wont start recording properly for half a year yet but in that time we can get started and have a good impression of what we want the album to sound like

8164057 they got hold of a safe and took it with them after forcing the domestic worker to show them where it was the men fled the scene in three cars
8164058 too many doctors get away with things they have done wrong but only a few people have the guts and the money to take them to court
8164059 because of guys like you our whole society is going to the dogs
8164060 if hospitals are unable to attend to patients they inform our control room which will then communicate with operational staff who then take patients to where they can be attended to properly
8164061 he was struggling to breathe in my view that was a life threatening situation
8164062 he told me he went to chris hani baragwanath then to leratong helen joseph and johannesburg hospitals and was turned away

8164071 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8164072 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8164073 i cant walk out to the bird feeder without having my legs completely covered with them
8164074 i was talking to my sister districts and theyre all scrambling too trying to catch up with these things hopefully by the weekend it will be better i wont say theyll be gone but hopefully theyll be better
8164075 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8164076 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8164077 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8164078 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8164079 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8164080 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there
8164081 part of the roof was knocked off and it landed on braniff road and knocked down some power lines
8164082 the computer models are all over the place right now
8164083 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8164084 the economic health of galveston is pretty sturdy but we have a sense that people are more pinched by the cost of food and fuel
8164085 we want people to recognize what it has done in the past to touch the community
8164086 were convinced people will see these good things happening around them and be willing to come back this year to support the campaign

8164090 slow down pause and savor enjoy the bounty of the earth wrap yourself around family friends and your culinary heritage and know the source of your food plant utopia and harvest a new reality
8164091 for me preparing food planning a menu gathering my friends around the table serving fresh seasonal and locally produced food that is what slow food is all about
8164092 its about pausing to experience the flavors and appreciate the effort that the farmer has made to grow the food and how it was prepared
8164093 its definitely about eating seasonally but also cooking from scratch rather than packages
8164094 here in sacramento we are very blessed to have so many farmers markets where we can meet the farmers learn where the food was grown or produced its important to preserve and support that resource
8164095 but no matter how important it is the no 1 reason overriding anything else is that it must taste good its all about taste
8164096 its a very rich tomato with a very winelike flavor and a deep red purplish color
8164097 its intensely flavored the epitome of heirloom tomatoes its not beautiful but it grows anywhere
8164098 if the market for heirlooms remains strong they should do ok
8164099 i like sheeps milk and cheese so i learned of the navajo churro while i was looking for dairy sheep
8164100 they give good dairy and nice wool and theyre an excellent meat animal the lamb is very mild and sweet instead of gamy i also love the heritage aspect of the sheep the idea of helping save a breed
8164101 theyre a scrub sheep used to scrounging off not so great pastures so we have to make sure they dont eat too much and theyre very wily you need good fencing

8164103 never discourage anyone who continually makes progress no matter how slow
8164104 happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony

8164112 af m dereferatet fremgik at bankens medlemmer er ekstremt uenige men hovedparten af fed medlemmerne synes stadig at de finansielle betingelser overordnet er ret stramme

8164138 now i have heard many many many a hundred a thousand accidents in this court in the past fifteen years so although i would never give myself out as an expert i have heard how many accidents happened and why or the way that is described makes absolutely a sense now the evidence of mr bezuidenhout i must admit is probably the best i have heard in many years i have heard how many experts testifying in this court some good some bad i have heard seven people so called experts come and testify as to the reconstruction of accidents afterwards this one professor from stellenbosch who made sort of a good impression on the court but not brilliant but i must admit this witness who testified today is taking the cake by far he clearly is head and shoulders above all other experts i have seen in court although he did not testify as an expert today the evidence that he gave is so clear and precise that the court cannot find any mistake whatsoever with that while he gave his evidence he did not want to venture into any assumptions or conclusions that he had drawn in cross examination he was pressed to make them and only after the court said if that is the case you can go ahead and make them he made those conclusions and they unfortunately make a hundred percent sense i cannot say any reason why the court should not accept them to come and say afterwards but you cannot say that that is the glass that was lying there was from this accident or that you cannot say there was not other glass he gave his explanation and his explanation is very clear that there was no other glass and it is very clear that that glass he explained why it would have been there why it would not have been in the front car why it would not have been at another place as i say all the evidence regarding the possible point of impact there is clearly no reason why the court should not accept that not even a hint of a suggestion that i cannot accept it

8164174 its hard enough with getting out onto main there especially during the summer with six flags new england open
8164175 the first is that i got stolen equipment from a neighbor and friend of mine
8164176 i knew the deal was really good i didnt know it was stolen
8164177 i took the responsibility i spent five days in jail and it was a mistake and i realized it was a mistake but i couldnt do anything but the five days in jail
8164178 i didnt go overboard just enough to get my point across i dont regret doing it because my daughter got away from him
8164179 i dont know where that information got pulled from ive done two things in my life ive protected my daughter and ive bought stolen equipment
8164180 it doesnt stop us or slow us down in any way
8164181 our ordinances are as such and may not be in keeping up with the times
8164182 we need to make sure the town is being run and cared for properly
8164183 it keeps basic family ventures going forward but puts a hold on any kind of excessive use if you will
8164184 we are exposed and i think now we know it
8164185 i think were all overreacting just a little bit until we get all the facts
8164186 later on if were not even in bethlehem theyre going to have to fight to put a doghouse in their backyard unfortunately theyre doing it to themselves

8164190 now that you know how we feel do you still want to come to bethlehem
8164191 we were hoping someone in town would come forward and want to sell us property on a more
8164192 we have other options we dont want the town to hate us

8164197 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus and the department has begun this assessment
8164198 this is a serious concern thats why i indicated that its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regimes
8164199 we can track a given food source a given food supply and if theres a problem find out quickly deal with the problem and make sure canadians are protected
8164200 i want to make sure that we have the highest public safeguards and safety nets in place thats where my focus has been

8164224 there are some areas where were seeing some active flame but its mostly smoke
8164225 the flames have dissipated a bit and the smoke has thinned so im staying put
8164226 i feel the fire department is really on it and thats really comforting and encouraging
8164227 frequently its just careless people whether an atver or someone with a cigarette or even power lines
8164228 these times are challenging and we can reasonably expect them to remain challenging for the near future
8164229 we also love the amenities package that brooks shorey destin florida throws in dolphin cruise round of golf movie rentals fishing for the kids and always make use of it and they throw in 2 beach chairs and an umbrella each day as well my husband and i are celebrating our 10th anniversary this summer and wed planned this grandiose trip to paris but we decided wed rather save our money and spend a week relaxing at the beach guess where were staying
8164230 i have three kids and the program made our vacation possible
8164231 my family has just returned from a week long vacation at the blue surf destin florida it was our first true family vacation with our two young children ages 2 and 3 the blue surf exceeded our expectations and provided the perfect environment for our young family as a side note the management company we used newman dailey provided a family fun pack with discounts and tickets including a free round of golf for each day free movie rentals tickets to the local amusement park and tickets for a dolphin cruise with a young family and a husband that golfs this was a huge bonus i think ive more than conveyed our satisfaction with the blue surf we are already looking forward to returning in the future

8164235 the other party has tabled an agenda an economic agenda that runs diametrically opposed to everything that this government stands for
8164236 so i think you really have increasingly in parliament two visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and obviously thats something im going to have to reflect on
8164237 has now in fact made it impossible for himself and his party to work with the government on finding common ground
8164238 they are full of contradictions they claim that we need to agree with their agenda on the phone when nobody knows which agenda he is talking about
8164239 ever since lindsay got out of rehab and all these people came back into her life things havent been right
8164240 people like samantha ronson dont need to be around lindsay she shouldnt be dragging lindsay around nightclubs who was samantha ronson before lindsay lohan she was nobody she is using her for her own gain all these people have inserted themselves into her life like parasites and its not right im done with them
8164241 monday i had a tip off as to where they were being kept whether it was true or not im not sure i received another tip off today from a journalist who claims he actually had been talking with the kidnappers
8164242 they went to a particular refugee camp out there and thats been confirmed by some journalists who we know in the area it was on the way back they were abducted
8164243 our experiences in the past have been that people who are kidnapped are treated generally fairly well and its really done for the money not for political reasons but again this is all speculation
8164244 the rumour is that its the al shabab which is the militant wing of the islamic courts union but the government and the islamic courts union who are the insurgents at the moment in somalia have both condemned the abduction and not taken any responsibility for it this is all speculation but the impression that im getting from our sources is that this was done by a group of bandits and theres not real political motivation behind the abduction other than for money
8164245 a huge collection of journalist contacts so were trying to work with them right now to see if we can at least identify where they are and then see what the next step is in terms of negotiation
8164246 gas prices are too high as you know i do own my own jet and i have been having flying back and forth to la pursuing my acting career
8164247 now if im flying back and forth like twice in a month thats like 200 000 or 250 000 round trip that im back on american airlines right now ok
8164248 check this out your boy diddy right now is on american airlines look
8164249 i want to give a shout out to all my saudi arabian brothers and sisters and all my brothers and sisters from all the countries that have oil if you could all please send me some oil for my jet i would truly appreciate it
8164250 but right now can you believe it i am actually flying commercial thats how high gas prices are ok so i feel you look im at the gate right now
8164251 this is proof that gas prices are too high we need to do something about it so tell whoever the next president is that we need to bring gas back down
8164252 i can assure you we take all precautions and all rules of engagement are followed
8164253 this is a matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8164254 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
8164255 we are not helping the taliban nor were they in the village
8164256 we dont know why the coalition forces raided our village with blind eyes this does not make sense
8164257 it is against the targets and objectives which we both the international community and the afghans have picked out
8164258 there is a need to exercise more caution we see what we can further improve by using much more of our intelligence doing a better analysis integrating our planning and bringing operational communications much closer together which will take care and prevent the repetition of such incidents
8164259 after you laid off your medication i feel hungover cut the connection i got no reason to communicate
8164260 you enjoy a little bit of violence discord and trouble making
8164261 maybe you should consider caring more about the world you live in

8164266 some of the higher quality energy stocks have come down so far this summer that they may be not bad of a place for people who are selling bank stocks
8164267 big cap names that have proven reserves in canada are definitely quality energy stocks like encana suncor
8164268 were struggling and trying to take our cue in terms of where do we go next
8164269 it almost seems like whats happening in canada doesnt really matter its just a global picture of the marketplace as far as financials are concerned
8164270 i dont think the fundamental picture is improving at all so i dont really see much of an upside for stocks in general going forward the next month or two
8164271 we apologize for any offense that is caused by the title
8164272 the pursuit of happiness is ingrained in americans as part of what it means to be an american

8164274 i agreed to help in the belief this step would also assist the labour party in its relations with mr peters i supported the labour party
8164275 there is clearly a conflict of evidence and i await the outcome of the privileges committee decision
8164276 the payment was made by me to assist funding the legal costs incurred personally by rt hon winston peters mp concerning his election petition dispute at his request
8164277 mr peters sought help from me for this purpose in a personal conversation some time after i had first met him in sydney
8164278 one can question whether mr glenn actually knows this letter has gone out have a look at the letter you might be the only one to realise mr glenn has not signed it no one has signed it anyone could have written that letter
8164279 mr glenn in his supposed letter said he did not make a contribution to nz first so i think there is a lack of credibility in mr glenns correspondence he has contradicted himself
8164280 i think the prime minister should be calling the foreign minister in right now and asking for some explanation
8164281 what scientists have only recently begun to realize is that people may do their best thinking when they are not concentrating on work at all
8164282 thank you but id rather die behind the chemical sheds
8164283 i was of the opinion we were after somebody who had committed an assault with a weapon against a police officer
8164284 i was trying to prevent the vehicle from going mobile again
8164285 ive seen instances where people get out on foot and double back to the car and take off again
8164286 i felt the sensation of being pushed sideways down the road and the police car going up on two wheels on the drivers side
8164287 im looking right at him and i gave him repeat commands to show me your hands
8164288 i was continuing to watch the suv i knew that if it started to come toward me i would have to try and stop him because i knew const blount was in the vehicle and would be seriously hurt or killed
8164289 i put it to you that you have made up you have concocted that statement that you did not hear that broadcast in order to evade or justify the shooting
8164290 you knew there would be no justification in firing into a vehicle if you knew there were occupants in the vehicle

8164456 attempted to weave a false account around objective and provable facts
8164457 the result is a farcical and shameless invention that denies any responsibility moral or otherwise in the kidnapping and murder of greg hosa and kathryn mckay
8164458 where she could not contrive an account capable of such calculated factual cohesion the offender employed the device of implicitly blackening the character of witnesses and the deceased
8164459 the changes we made were johan elmander who has a hamstring problem matty taylor who has a broken bone in his toe and kevin nolan who had a calf problem
8164460 kevin davies played with a stiff neck against newcastle and we didnt want to make it any worse if he and elmander were out people would be crowing about that
8164461 baseball is a game of inches pause its also a game of inges
8164462 it is a frustrating situation for us and the player because seydou is someone who we think can do a job for us and he is someone who wants to play for the club
8164463 we first applied for his registration with the league about 10 days ago but we were told that his visa despite having a condition on there that states he can do up to 16 hours work per week was not satisfactory and that he would need a work permit
8164464 we have since been advised by the football association to go to the home office and my assistant phil brown has spent a lot of time on the phone over the last few days trying to sort this out
8164465 we want to do things properly at this football club and all we ask for is someone to explain to us what we need to do in order to ensure that seydou can play for us
8164466 we are not banging a big drum about it at the moment but it is very frustrating for all concerned
8164467 do i really need this why push myself any further aw dammit i have a real job too
8164468 baseball is a game of inches pause its also a game of inges
8164469 while i am very pleased with the 2008 result against a background of financial turmoil and economic uncertainty the year should be viewed as a period of transition in the history of premier a year which has provided the platform for future growth premier chairman mr lew said

8164487 there is grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved
8164488 people desperately want darwin to be wrong because natural selection implies there is no plan to the universe including human nature
8164489 those who cavalierly reject the theory of evolution as not being adequately supported by facts seem to forget that their own theory is supported by no facts at all

8164541 inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her something he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
8164542 and as i tuck that little girl in and her little sister into bed at night you see i will think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election
8164543 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8164544 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8164545 he is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful
8164546 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8164547 you know were democrats theres always somebody complaining about something

8164562 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
8164563 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
8164564 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise
8164565 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8164566 she had a very defined moment to her collecting from about 1948 to the time of color field painting but that never limited her interest or support she was an aesthetic polyglot with an enormously gifted eye
8164567 she knew the artists and would tell us of how one day she ran into mark rothko on the street
8164568 rothko asked her to come see a painting hed just finished and she bought it right there the way she embraced the scene was very powerful and romantic
8164569 muriel always wanted to be viscerally involved in the now in her daily life as well as in her capacity as an art collector
8164570 if she could no longer be directly engaged she would remove herself as she did in recent years as her health decreased her gut response to art and life would not allow for a mediated experience
8164571 it was equally enjoyable to visit her after the met had taken the works away
8164572 she had completely redecorated the apartment with things from many genres it really was a pleasure to see how all the pieces were combined and how she lived with them
8164573 she was very independent original and had a great eye
8164574 so all the things she was attracted to simply lived well with each other
8164575 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8164576 i think average voters are turned off by the tearing down
8164577 but not by the building up i think voters like to see people coming together
8164578 hillary at points disappointed me on how far she went to try to tear barack down but i take my hat off to her for how shes handling it now
8164579 it depends how much you want to win all that early stuff was intramural sports now were into the real season and in the end she wants him to win i believe that
8164580 the question is does that tough clinton obama primary make obama tougher a lot of hillary supporters are saying yes
8164581 i believe it does you really dont know what to believe
8164582 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8164583 thanks to this generous grant we can work with experts in automatic speech recognition and in brain imaging at other universities to research a brain computer interface with applications in military medical and commercial settings

8164587 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8164588 predicting it is fine for the sake of kicks but its not a scientifically valid approach
8164589 you have to assume that everything that has happened in the past will continue in the future
8164590 freakiness of athletic talent at the extreme margins of humanity bolt it turns out is a perfect example
8164591 typically when you get someone that big they cant start
8164592 we dont really know what the best form is and maybe bolt is redefining that and showing us we missed something
8164593 the limits will be largely set by the rules of the ioc
8164594 its kind of an arms race with the regulators of the sport and the people trying to push the technology to the limits at some point here there must be a d tente where technology cant push us any further and the rules will restrict it
8164595 you could see really freakish things and we probably will
8164596 the people who are doing their level best to destroy everything good about the internet
8164597 when sentential utterances words and sentences are abandoned as a means of communication
8164598 there is absolutely nothing to link hari puttar with harry potter
8164599 even if it does rhyme with harry potter surely there is a limit to cases
8164600 however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
8164601 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session
8164602 we sent out a press release one day saying we were on the verge of closing it down and the next day we had 500 000
8164603 they shine the light on the real emergencies and step up where we really need help
8164604 for me the whole goal is to stay relevant as long as i can
8164605 it was a lot similar to those games last year very much so
8164606 i think any time somebody pops off i think it catches some fire to it between the media and the fans and our players
8164607 i think our players hear that and they kind of take that to heart they get up and they get more determined and everything thats kind of like fighting words it kind of sets them off
8164608 if you notice we seem like we are in a more business frame of mind so that means we dont particularly want to associate with them i like that ive always liked that i think when we come to the ballpark when i put my uniform on were going to come out here and beat you i dont have any friends on the field when were playing weve got a couple guys like that and i really love that part about them
8164609 barack is a fine person but i dont think hes ready to be president
8164610 well be monitoring every word that comes from the podium looking for factual inaccuracies responding with whats appropriate
8164611 its important because you cant let a news cycle much less an hour or two hours go with an attack that is a distortion of your candidates record

8164615 first of all the delaware delegation was moved from the back of the floor to the front when its a great view
8164616 what made me get into blogging was wanting to have a voice in politics
8164617 will discuss the situation in georgia following russias recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia
8164618 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8164619 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8164620 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8164621 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8164622 regrettable and we reaffirm our attachment to georgias territorial integrity

8164625 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer

8164630 im just here to cover the most important state in the union pennsylvanias going to decide the election
8164631 they the protesters want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8164632 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8164633 if you were to say who is the unluckiest person i know in the world
8164634 if you were to say who is the luckiest person i know in the world
8164635 i remind people that mccain may be the senator from arizona but hes really not of arizona hes of washington d c
8164636 i may not have been the best mother to her
8164637 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8164638 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8164639 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8164640 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8164641 dit waren eigenlijk twee relatief makkelijke bezoekjes geen grote problemen gelukkig soms is dat anders en dan ben ik echt aan het trainen met hond en cli nt ik probeer altijd om goed te luisteren naar mijn cli nten en om in een ongedwongen sfeer te werken daar zijn we immers allemaal het meeste bij gebaat

8164645 hidden agendas and motives are not conducive to spiritual liberation we must be pure of thought and intent
8164646 in other words if we profess belief in something then we must be willing to personally invest ourselves in sacrificial service to that to which we affirm belief or faith
8164647 but one thing i do forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead i press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of god in christ jesus

8164650 i just hope we get a seven day break leading into the first final but we cant control that
8164651 we will take what comes but in a perfect scenario we would get the regulation seven day break
8164652 but there are so many possibilities who can end up where the kangaroos can finish anywhere from fourth to eighth that we cant even think about it
8164653 he is more unlikely than likely to play this week at this stage but he is running pretty strongly
8164654 in a broad sense i think ways of rewarding high performance are welcome but the devil is in the detail mr mcalpine said
8164655 so long as its done in a way that reflects the genuine complexity and context of schools and the challenges of both leadership and teaching then i think it will be good thing
8164656 make a real difference but questioned where the funding would come from
8164657 i think it would be much better if the federal government could make direct funding to schools of an average of half a million dollars each and that funding be used to improve the learning in the school rather than the state governments having to meet the federal governments commitments he said
8164658 we are really concerned that this government is really not talking to the people it needs to talk to before its making decisions about whats best for australia she said
8164659 hes stating he knows what parents want well were not sure how hes actually engaged with the parents of state schools when he hasnt run this past the national body
8164660 we dont support any league tables weve seen what they can do in the uk weve seen cases of parents fighting with each other buying addresses raffle tickets so you can get in the line to get into a school thats higher up the league table she said
8164661 i knew it was a robbery the first thought that came to mind was to save the money he told the
8164662 in the midst of the commotion the robbers grabbed the money changers bags thinking that i had already placed the money bag onto the trolley he said
8164663 the declaration overnight by russian president dmitry medvedev i dont believe is a helpful contribution indeed some may regard that as provocative
8164664 australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and our ongoing position is that we believe that russia should abide by the ceasefire effected through the european union and french president nicolas sarkozy and return its forces to the positions they occupied on august 6 and 7
8164665 i think well be able to strengthen legislation and apply bandaid solutions to give us breathing space but ultimately if you want to preserve koalas and everything we value such as less crowded beaches and roads then the population has to be stabilised
8164666 i am concerned that the state government is trying to manipulate the national strategy by being seen to be doing something about the dire state of koalas in queensland
8164667 ive read 700 post mortems of urban koalas and i can tell you a lot of these koalas are simply starving to death
8164668 we found the abducted japanese man minutes ago he has been shot several times kuz kunar district governor malim mashouq said
8164669 we are aware of press reports but are still checking a foreign ministry official said in tokyo
8164670 yes they police have found him unfortunately dead noor zaman deputy manager of the organisation in eastern nangarhar province said

8164673 she had a very defined moment to her collecting from about 1948 to the time of color field painting but that never limited her interest or support she was an aesthetic polyglot with an enormously gifted eye

8164680 she was very independent original and had a great eye
8164681 so all the things she was attracted to simply lived well with each other
8164682 never to get lost is not to live not to know how to get lost brings you to destruction and somewhere in the terra incognita in between lies a life of discovery
8164683 give give give what is the point of having experience knowledge or talent if i dont give it away of having stories if i dont tell them to others of having wealth if i dont share it i dont intend to be cremated with any of it it is in giving that i connect with others with the world and with the divine
8164684 dont ask yourself what the world needs ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do it because what the world needs is people who have come alive
8164685 i knew it was a robbery the first thought that came to mind was to save the money
8164686 in the midst of the commotion the robbers grabbed the money changers bags thinking that i had already placed the money bag onto the trolley
8164687 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
8164688 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese living on the border with us

8164691 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
8164692 declared him fit to run for political office and free of any symptoms

8164734 we lacked that last year we got a big lead and then we got relaxed and we got satisfied this year we dont want to get satisfied we have to play full force every minute
8164735 defensively they have struggled stopping people consistently but i believe they will be a much improved team
8164736 i know they are excited about improving we are going to worry about us and be prepared for everything we can

8164912 i had been on the news condemning the attacks on police officers
8164913 there is no doubt in my mind that it was specifically me who was attacked and targeted because they waited until i had walked away until i came under attack
8164914 however police will continue in their efforts to bring calm to the area despite these attacks on them
8164915 i would appeal to everyone involved in the trouble to stop it now before someone is either injured or killed

8164932 for me preparing food planning a menu gathering my friends around the table serving fresh seasonal and locally produced food that is what slow food is all about
8164933 its about pausing to experience the flavors and appreciate the effort that the farmer has made to grow the food and how it was prepared
8164934 its definitely about eating seasonally but also cooking from scratch rather than packages
8164935 here in sacramento we are very blessed to have so many farmers markets where we can meet the farmers learn where the food was grown or produced its important to preserve and support that resource

8164955 inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her something he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
8164956 and as i tuck that little girl in and her little sister into bed at night you see i will think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election
8164957 all of us have seen in the news the frequent reports of young people killing strangers in the street killing fathers defending their property killing people with learning difficulties killing other young people who are different to them
8164958 for 41 years weve lived in a state sponsored culture of death that has killed five million children and were now surprised that some of the surviving children have turned out violent with no regard for the sanctity of life
8164959 how many children know that their mothers have had an abortion what effect will it have on them knowing that they have been deprived of a brother or sister through abortion if a society holds human life so cheaply is it any surprise that young people will also hold life cheaply and engage in violence

8165029 we are counting among other things on people taking early retirement
8165030 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8165031 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8165032 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out
8165033 the guy retired fox sports on msn nfl strahan turns down giants will stay retired awful announcing found this 9 hours ago on
8165034 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8165035 obviously the first meeting i had with him was very disappointing to him but there is no other person on this team that is dedicated like nate to team success he still provides great leadership to kevin and the offense
8165036 he has a great attitude its really impressive to see a guy take that approach of not going into the tank and feeling sorry for himself but really really dedicated to the success of this football team
8165037 its hard when you disappoint somebody its emotional for them its not easy to do but he understood what i was saying
8165038 at fan appreciation day i think every person i saw wanted another hit like that
8165039 he resembles justin forsett a little bit i think hes a little bigger but hes fast he can make all the cuts and all the moves he has the physical tools to get the job done we have a huge task
8165040 we have experience going against a guy like forsett in practice weve had great running backs here every year since ive been here i dont think it will be that big of a challenge but you definitely have to respect him because hes a great back
8165041 you get more reps at practice which is good because you get more looks
8165042 theyre looking out for my best interest but i feel like i need the reps and i need the drills to make myself better so i tried to get in there as much as possible
8165043 if i had my choice id still be playing gunner on punt team im just excited about it any way i can help the team im ready to do it
8165044 probably not set the bar high and see where you can go as an offensive line thats our job to protect the quarterback to me it sounds kind of obvious
8165045 last year i tried a little bit but i dont think i did a good enough job
8165046 im much more of a quiet guy im growing into it
8165047 i hope i gave them a good look and theyve got used to going against me hopefully im still a good center and not just a bunch of hype

8165069 there was anger there but our music was of a time and a place
8165070 there was so much mediocrity in music at the time nirvana had just come out but i honestly never thought about getting a record deal or the money we didnt care if we played to nine or 10 people all our spare money went to a rehearsal space and beer and the accoutrements

8165127 these days actors actresses act for money they put money first but in your days acting was like a hobby fun to you people in that sense can you tell us how much you got for acting in things fall apart

8165163 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
8165164 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
8165165 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
8165166 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
8165167 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
8165168 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
8165169 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
8165170 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
8165171 it was so important to me to get my dog back and i was so thankful
8165172 i was really happy to see veterinarians come to new orleans it really helps every convention that comes helps a little bit i never knew that there were so many animal lovers in the world
8165173 it was a wonderful program run by the foundation the improvements made to these facilities were immense but i still believe that the people that got the most of out it were the volunteers themselves they really enjoyed contributing their time and the efforts to help rebuild new orleans
8165174 we were able to complete more work than we expected and the facilities looked so much better when we were finished
8165175 the american veterinary medical association generated over 9 million in economic impact by bringing their annual convention to new orleans in the off peak summer months which not only fueled our citys most important economic engine tourism but also supported our chefs street performers musicians artists etc that make new orleans the unique destination that it is
8165176 above and beyond avma donated their time to assist in building new homes for our animal community we cant wait to welcome them back
8165177 people loved the cajun food in wonderful restaurants and they had to be surprised at seeing no effects from katrina in the downtown area
8165178 many unsolicited comments related how impressed attendees were with quality of speakers breadth and relevance of topics and excellence of educational opportunities opening session came off without a hitch with cokie roberts being extremely well received family night and the best of the bayou were roaring successes the final fling featuring rocky laporte was enjoyed by all

8165180 who say that taking away consumers right to sue would also take away a strong incentive for the fda and the pharmaceutical industry to be open about a drugs potential for causing harm
8165181 havent always been completely open or correct in their labeling even when the risk of lawsuits has been present
8165182 preserving the right of consumers to sue will keep federal agencies and manufacturers more honest and the public more protected
8165183 a total of 15 556 subjects answered the questions on snoring
8165184 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
8165185 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
8165186 these new findings suggest that further knowledge about the early life environment may contribute to the primary prevention of snoring
8165187 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
8165188 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
8165189 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
8165190 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
8165191 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
8165192 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
8165193 everybody knows that sleep is important yet the function ofsleep seems like the mythological phoenix
8165194 wedont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important becauseall animals do it
8165195 thevery fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot beeliminated
8165196 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plasticthe next day
8165197 whilethere may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it wouldseem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at thecellular level is still a worthwhile exercise

8165199 risks significant misuse of funds in this 39 billion program
8165200 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
8165201 some plan sponsors are dragging their feet on required anti fraud prevention and cms is letting them get away with it
8165202 orally instructed auditors to deviate from written policies by making determinations based primarily on the limited medical records available from equipment suppliers
8165203 i want to know what happened whos responsible who will be held accountable and what hhs secretary mike leavitt will do about it
8165204 if people cooked the books manipulated the methodology or told the contractor to ignore the rules those individuals need to take the heat
8165205 if this is true this is an outrageous and unforgivable stunt cracking down on fraud should be a top priority for medicare not fixing numbers to make an agency look better
8165206 i expect hearings and i expect answers truthful answers from medicare about this report
8165207 an unsupported extrapolation at this time because the report only cited percentages
8165208 we have far exceeded our expectations having reduced the error rate beyond the 2007 goal of 5
8165209 exceeded only by a staggering lack of oversight by congress and by medicares own failure to protect the program against open thievery
8165210 cooking the books proves true heads should roll at cms
8165211 adequately fund investigations and after medical industry lobbyists complained about a new law requiring competitive bidding congress reneged on the deal
8165212 politicos lingering around washington can barely keep a straight face as they claim to be shocked
8165213 his ilk consistently claim that medicare is a model for government run universal health care because it spends less on overhead than the private sector
8165214 insurance companies spend money to screen their claims for fraud
8165215 medicare automatically pays more than 95 of the bills it receives
8165216 this lack of scrutiny reduces overhead but it makes the program highly vulnerable to abuse
8165217 the real reason liberals like mr stark are outraged is because they want to claim one of medicares vices as a virtue to help along their health care ambitions
8165218 shows that taxpayers will be literally poorer if stark gets his way
8165219 skin lesions showed rapid improvement afterdiscontinuation of anabolic androgenic steroid abuse and withantiseptic and antibiotic therapy however the extensive scarring islikely to remain with the young man for the rest of his life
8165220 danger of legitimizing the ethical fraud of abstinence only education
8165221 only to say that they fail not that they protect against pregnancy
8165222 because ethical educators and health professionals wont have anything to do with these programs
8165223 it would be saying its ok for our kids to get inaccurate and dangerous misinformation as long as somebody else tells the lies
8165224 these discredited programs are just the kind that a pro choice pro family planning democratic governor should want to stand in the way of
8165225 some perspective on the policy arguments between the mccain and obama camps
8165226 want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers
8165227 like other democrats he was pushing for a big government program to deal with what he saw as market failures in health care and to bring down the price of insurance
8165228 program was in place though he trusted a market of individuals to make its own decisions once the government had subsidized health insurance he thought the vast majority of the uninsured would sign up
8165229 find traction in the presidential race where health care remains a large issue
8165230 give both candidates a spring board to tout their very different health care plans
8165231 move some money from here to there cut some government waste no one apparently ever noticed and then fund an unattainable promise with an outlandish price tag
8165232 totes up dubious savings to fund his ultimate goal of making health insurance affordable to everyone
8165233 obamas own web site points out that health insurance premiums have risen six times faster than wages in the last four years
8165234 to be sure there are many laudable goals in obamas plan
8165235 improve the nations health and may moderate if not lower long term health care costs
8165236 near term price tag is clearly being underestimated to make the medicine go down a little easier
8165237 promises to provide every american access to affordable comprehensive health care and to achieve long overdue mental health and addiction treatment parity
8165238 thats right the dems will expand the number of people who receive subsidized health care provide better benefits and you apparently dont have to worry about costs going up
8165239 dems are going to eliminate waste in the medical system they will save the typical family up to 2 500 per year
8165240 how to pay for all these bright packages chances are that you wont have to give but only will get get get
8165241 then the platform promises a return to fiscal responsibility really
8165242 suggestion that mr obama is all rhetorical fluff is mistaken
8165243 place him at almost any point on the democratic political spectrum
8165244 era of big government would not be over in an obama administration
8165245 jetzt ist die zeit gekommen sich als eine partei mit einem ziel zu versammeln
8165246 barack obama ist mein kandidat und er muss unser pr sident sein
8165247 das ist nicht richtig das sind vier weitere jahre die wir uns nicht leisten k nnen
8165248 amerika hat nie angst vor der zukunft gehabt und wir sollten jetzt nicht damit anfangen
8165249 wenn er die antwort ist dann muss die frage ein witz sein
8165250 barack obama ist eine charmante und anst ndige pers nlichkeit mit einer liebenswerten familie aber er ist nicht bereit f r die pr sidentschaft
8165251 i think weve been through enough with the media and different things
8165252 this coaching staff may not want me to be the quarterback
8165253 both guys played extremely well in preseason gave them both starts gave them equal opportunities and jake i wouldnt have guessed when we signed wade but jakes rehab the way hes come back ended up beating him out
8165254 i couldnt go to my left i could go to my right i just couldnt plant off my left you cant tell the coach nah lets just run right it doesnt work too good getting that thing fixed has been the biggest thing for me
8165255 were going to look at some things in some certain personnels to utilize him because he catches the ball so well and he is a bigger tailback
8165256 its going to be hard to repeat because we had a pretty senior dominated team last year and we are really young in the offensive and defensive lines
8165257 we all got to touch it ill never be an olympian so this was the next best thing living it through someone else
8165258 im still a little fearful going to the basket that somebody might hit it again ive just got to suck it up
8165259 people dont realize how banged up we were before the monthlong break
8165260 we decided to do the poll because no one was doing it getting the opinion of the people most involved or affected by the way their constituency is run the people of jurong grc
8165261 although it was a simple poll of 2 questions it gives a reasonable feel of what the people of jurong grc think about the issue of having a by election there in the wake of the passing of one of its mps dr ong chit chung 478 singaporeans is a decent number to poll considering our very limited resources
8165262 if you miss the train leaving the station you have to dig a little deeper for a ticket
8165263 there were a lot of people who supported senator obama early and i was not one of them
8165264 he understandably feels an amount of loyalty and obligation i am sure to make sure that they are given an opportunity especially if they risked a lot politically by coming out early for him
8165265 four years ago he was a 400 hitter in triple a ball now hes batting 285 in the big leagues
8165266 hes made a huge leap in terms of his career in terms of responsibilities
8165267 if you step back from the poll numbers he had a very successful two years as governor
8165268 i know hes taken a few arrows but he is still standing

8165290 senator currie in my opinion is guilty of making a terrible mistake
8165291 knowing him i believe it was absent mindedness still he lobbied the government on behalf of a private entity for personal profit
8165292 it is certainly something that will be undertaken by a legislative ethics committee
8165293 and i think that he needs to be allowed to explain exactly what occurred
8165294 i was of the impression that we would wait until the investigation has concluded and decide from there whether there is any basis for any action

8165310 dass immer mehr menschen immer niedrigere l hne haben ist ein ergebnis der agenda 2010 insbesondere von hartz iv
8165311 die gesetzliche verpflichtung jede arbeit annehmen zu m ssen zeigt ihre fatale wirkung in der lohnabw rtsspirale
8165312 die so genannten volksparteien spd und union spalten das volk in arme und reiche die privatisierung ffentlicher einrichtungen und die hartz gesetze f hren zu armut trotz arbeit und sie zwingen die gewerkschaften in die defensive
8165313 was jetzt noch nicht zu tage tritt ist dass damit auch die rentenerwartung f r zuk nftige rentnerjahrg nge sinkt w hrend im oecd durchschnitt ein arbeitnehmer der heute 1000 euro verdient eine rente von 730 euro zu erwarten hat sind f r ihn in deutschland ganze 400 euro rente vorgesehen damit ist millionenfache altersarmut gesetzlich programmiert das ist ein skandal
8165314 sie muss die infrastruktur ausbauen die lohnpolitik muss wieder darauf ausgerichtet werden dass sich die einkommen entsprechend der produktivit t und der preissteigerungen entwickeln die gesetze die wie hartz iv zum lohndumping einladen m ssen ge ndert und der allgemeine gesetzliche mindestlohn endlich eingef hrt werden
8165315 a lot of schools had five defensive backs coming in
8165316 there was nothing that was going to keep him away
8165317 there was a second round of discussion about is he going to be able to do it
8165318 he knew it all along there was no way he was not going to do it
8165319 on many levels it was a very difficult thing to do logistically medically emotionally
8165320 i think the only thing that matches mondays speech was the feeling i got when he walked on the senate floor to cast the deciding vote for medicare
8165321 he again disregarded his own personal health to be a unifier a healer
8165322 people wanted to talk about how he was the first one to call them when they lost a family member
8165323 it was really on a whole other level for me of being able to see his effect and his reach his impact on the senate

8165331 in four months well have an administration that actually believes in science
8165332 if you drill in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has that proposition is a dry well
8165333 she would not be where she is tonight if not for mark penn shed be the nominee
8165334 it makes a lot of sense that next week john mccain and george bush will be together in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart

8165343 by pluralism here i mean the coexistence within the one political community of groups who hold divergent and incompatible views with regard to religious questions those ultimate questions that concern the nature and destiny of man within a universe that stands under the reign of god pluralism therefore implies disagreement and dissension within the community but it also implies a community within which there must be agreement and consensus there is no small political problem here

8165345 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8165346 a white paper on the black deeds of the congress government in punjab
8165347 this year the farmers had to spend rs 2000 per acre as labour cost for paddy plantation alone the amount of relief granted by the centre rs 1400 per acre following a recommendation of just rs 2000 per acre by the previous congress government was not enough even to meet this cost when you add up all input and capital costs incurred by the farmer on the crop the figure is close to rs 20 000 that is why we have asked the centre to review the existing norms and fix a minimum of rs 15 000 per acre as relief cum compensation
8165348 the said amount of the crf is no more than a meaningless book entry as the state cannot spend a penny beyond the limit recommended by the congress government headed by amarinder singh to the center the congress regime specifically told the centre that no farmer should be paid more than rs 2000 per acre for the total crop loss in floods or any other natural calamity similarly the then chief minister recommended a ceiling of just rs 25 000 as relief cum compensation for total collapse of a house the centre in fact agreed to pay only rs 1400 per acre these and similar other figures given by the state government during the congress rule were not only ridiculously inadequate but were positively cruel to the beleaguered victims of the floods in punjab now the state government is not permitted to give any relief beyond these norms true to style and to its known attitude towards the poor in general and the punjabis in particular the congress played the real villain depriving the hapless victims of natural calamities such as floods of much needed government relief and compensation

8165358 what would happen if israel recaptured the sinai peninsula would you fight to defend the homeland
8165359 i have to think about it its possible that i would not
8165360 i asked the one who said no to explain his statement
8165361 and he answered that a man goes to war to defend a homeland which he feels is his own a nation which provides him with warmth and security and a government which implements justice and equality
8165362 this is a tragedy that has never before visited egypt
8165363 are willing to work even in israel to restore the honor that poverty and unemployment robbed from them
8165364 the regimes security is thoroughly preserved the current crisis is the security of the homeland this regime is incapable of protecting anyone but itself its people and their fortunes deposited beyond the nations borders their planes are ready at any moment and their palaces are buttressed thus the profound gap between the public and the regime was created while the public and particularly the poor are exposed to the cannons the cannons of the high cost of living the cannons of tragedies and the cannons of unemployment
8165365 when the pen or the gum that children use is produced in china and a young man wears a shirt printed with the flag of the united states and cuts his hair to suit the fashion of stars in europe why demand that he be an egyptian and feel that he belongs to this nation
8165366 the lack of identity has transformed the nation into a supermarket can you expect someone to sacrifice his life for a supermarket your only relations with the supermarket are that you a buy a few products there that you can acquire anywhere else
8165367 the problem is that the nation accustomed its citizens to expecting that it would fulfill all their demands
8165368 as if there is an agreement between the nation and its citizens that it would provide them with homes and places of employment and they would supply it with obedience and silence the real problem begins when young people understand that the nation cannot supply everything it is too weak and too poor and they are willing to take the matter into their own hands the meaning of that usually involves standing in line to obtain a visa in one of the consulates in order to leave for another country but then they are accused of betraying their homeland and the biggest betrayal is attempting to work in israel what does the editor of almasry alyoum want that the nation provide them with everything that it continue gamal abdel nassers policy which promised hills and mountains and caused a crisis

8165413 rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive

8165423 the terror group hamas tried to stage a media pr event and failed big time
8165424 we knew about this hamas attempt to create a pr event at sea for weeks we knew whos on these boats and what they contain and therefore we decided weeks ago to allow them to come into gaza they were not carrying weapons and had only a handful of equipment for the hearing impaired
8165425 one cannot place any responsibility on the palestinian authority for these theatrics as the pa has no control of gaza
8165426 supposed to have been brought in by the two palestine boats carrying international leftist activists who support hamas suicide bombers and rocket attacks on israel towns and cities

8165441 barack obama ist mein kandidat und er muss unser pr sident sein
8165442 wir brauchen keinen pr sidenten der der vergangenheit verhaftet ist
8165443 barack obama ist eine charmante und anst ndige pers nlichkeit mit einer liebenswerten familie aber er ist nicht bereit f r die pr sidentschaft
8165444 es ist ja nicht so als wollten die leute mac os nicht nutzen vielmehr sind menschen offen f r diese idee aber sie sind es nicht gewohnt eine exorbitante summe f r etwas auszugeben das eigentlich normale computerhardware ist

8165453 for us to send this letter flies in the face of reason and flies in the face of what i believe our community wants and stands for
8165454 regardless of what our views are if there is a national emergency for fuel the considerations of santa barbara are liable to be lost
8165455 not only do we not have enough money to do the things we want but we need to do this on our own terms in a way that we control in order to preempt an emergency extraction
8165456 the problem is that we are addicted to oil everybody knows that when a junkie needs a fix they are dangerous and dont make good decisions
8165457 but new drilling is not part of the solution it the amount of oil available off shore is a drop in bucket if that
8165458 think where we would be today if we had started looking at this 30 years ago when we had our oil crisis in the 1970s if we had started moving away from oil then think where we would be today
8165459 we strongly disagree with the premise and conclusions of that letter and we are concerned with the about the extensive misinformation contained in that letter we look forward to working with you and our partners at the state and local level to maintain the moratoria

8165473 the cost is going to be passed on to consumers
8165474 warne and i didnt really know for a while what to speak when we met bradman he did not meet anyone else and we were privileged to have got an invitation it was the first time i was meeting him and i was really looking forward to the occasion i had a wonderful time as we spoke for an hour or so
8165475 bradman said that he would catch a game or two of cricket on the television whenever he got time and it was great to know that he still followed the game though he was turning 90 it was an absolutely fantastic and fabulous experience
8165476 i was at a bcci camp when the invitation came and i was allowed to travel to adelaide for a couple of days to meet bradman
8165477 we can no longer be looked at as this couch potato what about me
8165478 the economic health of galveston is pretty sturdy but we have a sense that people are more pinched by the cost of food and fuel
8165479 we want people to recognize what it has done in the past to touch the community
8165480 were convinced people will see these good things happening around them and be willing to come back this year to support the campaign
8165481 the computer models are all over the place right now
8165482 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8165483 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8165484 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8165485 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8165486 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8165487 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8165488 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there
8165489 part of the roof was knocked off and it landed on braniff road and knocked down some power lines
8165490 thats one bad hombte cahill really stuck his posts into the wrong newsgroup this time
8165491 my plans are to be a board member that is very interactive at the actual school building level and begins an immediate cooperation with all teachers
8165492 its easier to make a good product in a short time with an easy to use engine than it is with one of the premiere engines with all the bells and whistles
8165493 we never really considered developing an in house engine for our xbla or wiiware titles
8165494 if we worked on 2d titles an in house engine might be feasible but we like to focus on fully 3d downloadable titles so it really doesnt make sense to have a dedicated game engine group as we scale up to retail triple a games this may change but the middleware option really makes sense for short play games
8165495 they have differences of opinion sometimes its over crime and the proceeds of crime sometimes its personal
8165496 and they tend to resolve their differences in a violent way
8165497 in june this year laws to directly target bikies and their associates were rushed through parliament with the pledge that these laws would allow police and prosecutors to clean up our streets
8165498 the examination of the crime scene suggests to us its not a random shooting or a drive by shooting
8165499 my bid was 12 weeks behind the gold coast so we have been running to fill the criteria and a business plan
8165500 given the fact they approve us tonight we would still need two to three weeks to put the legal agreement together and do a bit of branding
8165501 whilst some nazi propaganda was simply out right crude statements of hate people like goebbels realized that to be really effective propaganda had to be faintly credible that it had to subtly massage peoples already extant prejudices
8165502 the debased and ignorant self interest that grips jerseys elite like a cancer
8165503 but perhaps more fundamentally than this you are simply thick
8165504 i am a true jerseyman of a very ancient pedigree
8165505 from 60 sites at present there should be no more than 20 in the future
8165506 we are counting among other things on people taking early retirement
8165507 it was a tough decision but we just thought that with cassio and diego theyve already been there and know what to expect and cristiano has got a fair bit of experience
8165508 we have also got cover if we have to on that side the right but it wasnt an easy decision because i would have liked to have all of them in there
8165509 we need to back up rural and regional sa for the long term
8165510 so i am asking the premier to get his department to establish the impact on rural and regional communities as a result of this massive drop in income loss of jobs from and hardship in the sector
8165511 we need to establish the impact these losses have had on rural and regional sa and what initiatives need to be put forward to assist rural and regional communities to regrow their economies
8165512 with the decline in manufacturing and our critical need for food security that is to feed ourselves we must look after this critical industry
8165513 we call upon this labor government to fight hard over the next 18 months for farming families
8165514 the koala is one of our greatest and most loved national icons and the government is committed to ensuring its ongoing conservation
8165515 two years ago koalas were assessed and did not at that stage meet the criteria for listing under the act
8165516 however ive made a commitment to reassess the koala for listing and its conservation status will be thoroughly assessed
8165517 this assessment will provide important ecological information for the longer term management of the murray river below the darling junction and so will complement the work already being undertaken to address the critical problems of the lower murray

8165519 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8165520 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8165521 we are ready to go to jail if police come to get us
8165522 when we came into government mt lawley high school was falling down it was in a terrible state it was in a shocking state
8165523 and we set about rebuilding it in stages until you get the magnificent building and facilities that youve got here today
8165524 there are some schools that were built back in the 50s and 60s and even into the 70s that are now looking very tired and old
8165525 there was a period of time through the 90s when very little money was spent on schools and certainly our organisation was concerned about that
8165526 and at least in the last four or five years theres been a significant investment in the public education system
8165527 the costs of delivering education are very much more in building costs than they used to be eight or nine years ago and i dont think the liberal partys come to grips with the change in the cost structures
8165528 attempted to weave a false account around objective and provable facts
8165529 the result is a farcical and shameless invention that denies any responsibility moral or otherwise in the kidnapping and murder of greg hosa and kathryn mckay
8165530 where she could not contrive an account capable of such calculated factual cohesion the offender employed the device of implicitly blackening the character of witnesses and the deceased

8165637 while the martu people have not yet had the opportunity to properly consider uranium mining on their lands we are not opposed to it in principle
8165638 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state
8165639 this is an important intergenerational issue for our people and its an issue that martu should be able to consider and make decisions about in an informed manner
8165640 it is especially a means of achieving economic and social outcomes for a group of people who continue to be under serviced by the state government
8165641 we have also been making representations to minister jim mcginty the minister for health in relation to martu health issues and he has not even replied to our requests for a meeting
8165642 its an opportunity we believe has been taken away from us by the premier yesterday
8165643 by proposing to ban uranium mining the state alp government is effectively robbing one of the most poor and disenfranchised people in this country of the right to earn a living and potentially achieve an equity stake in a major mining project
8165644 albany man accused of forcing pregnant woman from her car
8165645 this decision is inconsistent with numerous united nations security council resolutions that russia has voted for in the past and is also inconsistent with the french brokered six point ceasefire agreement which president medvedev signed

8165688 i think well be able to strengthen legislation and apply bandaid solutions to give us breathing space but ultimately if you want to preserve koalas and everything we value such as less crowded beaches and roads then the population has to be stabilised
8165689 i am concerned that the state government is trying to manipulate the national strategy by being seen to be doing something about the dire state of koalas in queensland
8165690 ive read 700 post mortems of urban koalas and i can tell you a lot of these koalas are simply starving to death

8165709 i first got the idea to do the film when i visited the plain of jars in laos in 2002
8165710 you could still see the craters from the air bombing and unexploded ordinance was everywhere
8165711 then i heard about long chen and the fact that no one had got there since the war and i thought how do i visit and how do i make a film about it
8165712 i found it bizarre that at one time this was the second biggest city in laos and it was completely secret
8165713 laos was the progenitor of the way america fights wars in the 21
8165714 the cia had just declassified a whole lot of material so that helped as well
8165715 the most important source was the guys who were over there filming with their little super 8 cameras often illegally
8165716 we destroyed a whole civilisation we wiped it off the map we incinerated atomised human remains in this air war and what happened in the end we lost
8165717 after we went another uk crew tried to get there but they were caught and deported
8165718 there are some places in the world that have a different energy and long chen is one of these you look down the runway and think this is the place were it all happened the planes took off from here and bombed all those people
8165719 its just an army outpost now a small village a couple of hundred people soldiers and their families
8165720 the golden age of long chen is over it used to be the high tech oasis for spooks in laos there were allegedly more antennas there than trees now they do not even have power
8165721 there are still some groups but they are not organised they are certainly not politically or militarily organised they are remnants the children and grandchildren of those involved in the war who are scared to come out of the jungle because they have never known anything else
8165722 whether vang pao is guilty or not of the charges he is facing one thing that is true is that he and other expatriate hmong have used these people as pawns
8165723 i do not see that happening in the next few years it is still far too sensitive on the part of the lao government
8165724 they are also keen not to risk unsettling relations with the americans by opening it up
8165725 we are gathering not in a sense of celebrating but as a way of saying that from today we will be building our peace and we will have our dignity and our happiness which is what i believe the supreme court above all cares about the peace and happiness of the community which they havent had for a long time because there are still invasions of our land

8165733 6 be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god 7 and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds through christ jesus
8165734 lord i care not what i want but fill my hands with what you have for me
8165735 god is not in the knuckle breaking business he will never force himself on you
8165736 make your requests not demands be known to god and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds
8165737 consider the work of god for who can make straight what he has made crooked in the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider surely god has appointed the one as well as the other so that man can find out nothing that will come after him
8165738 now it came to pass as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased that one of his disciples said to him
8165739 i dont know if you guys are ready for this maybe when you guys grow up in me a little more then ill show you
8165740 in this manner therefore pray our father in heaven hallowed be your name
8165741 and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying out
8165742 people think this is where it might of happened but there are three other places that think the same
8165743 the lord is longsuffering and abundant in mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression but he by no means clears the guilty
8165744 show me a mans friends and i will tell you what type of man he is
8165745 the idols of the nations are silver and gold the work of mens hands they have mouths but they do not speak eyes they have but they do not hear nor is there any breath in their mouths those who make them are like them so is everyone who trusts in them
8165746 harlotry wine and new wine enslave the heart my people ask counsel from their wooden idols and their staff informs them for the spirit of harlotry has caused them to stray and they have played the harlot against their god they offer sacrifices on the mountaintops and burn incense on the hills under oaks poplars and terebinths because their shade is good therefore your daughters commit harlotry and your brides commit adultery
8165747 it does not matter who or what you worship as long as youre sincere
8165748 arent all gods basically the same thing they all lead to the same end as much as i would like to agree with these statements i cannot peoples actions spring from their beliefs perhaps one of the most important things to know about a person is what their perception of god is because their character will follow their answer if they view god as vengeful or full of wrath i guarantee that that person will have anger issues or if a person sees god as a sensual being i can predict that that person will be focused on only one thing in a relationship or if a person sees no god then i can tell you that that person sees himself or herself as the center of the universe being the final authority on everything whether we like it or not our concepts of god have direct consequences on the type of people we are it is for this reason that we must not accept any concept of god but the right one the truthful one not a man created ideology but a god revealed reality we take good care in picking the people we trust as friends we wouldnt share our secrets with just anyone we take even greater care in the things we eat we make sure that our food is healthy and edible should we not apply as much if not more effort with the question of god and who he is
8165749 i am the way i am the truth and i am the life i am the resurrection i am the savior and i am jesus the solution the restorer the builder the answer the wise one the coming one the mighty one i am there lord and there is no other i am god and there is none besides me i am the first and the last i am the alpha and the omega i am the beginning and the end i am the lord that is my name and i will not give my glory to any other or my praise to idols i am that i am and that is my name my memorial name to every single generation
8165750 lord i sanctify your name i just love you so much
8165751 lord just wait a little longer before you come because i still want to be an astronaut
8165752 then i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
8165753 behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people god himself will be with them and be their god and god will wipe away every tear from their eyes there shall be no more death nor sorrow nor crying there shall be no more pain for the former things have passed away
8165754 it is done i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end i will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts he who overcomes shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son
8165755 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable to god which is your reasonable service 2 and do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
8165756 well if the lord really wants me to serve on my day off i guess its his will that has to be done
8165757 oh look another day in eternity i guess ill have to just worship god again
8165758 your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
8165759 lord help me live today according how you designed me to live in eternity
8165760 and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
8165761 forgive them father for they know not what they do
8165762 and do not lead us into temptation but deliver us from the evil one

8165765 woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts
8165766 behold this has touched your lips your iniquity is taken away and your sin purged
8165767 whom shall i send and who will go for us
8165768 keep me away from anything that will hinder my walk with you lord keep me above reproach amongst my coworkers my peers my family i dont want a spot or wrinkle that will hinder your work being done in my life and your glory being magnified
8165769 for yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen

8165785 but what happens if collectivist societies snap out of their economic stagnation what happens if collectivist societies especially those in asia rise economically and come to rival the west a new sort of global conversation develops
8165786 the opening ceremony in beijing was a statement in that conversation it was part of chinas assertion that development doesnt come only through western liberal means but also through eastern and collective ones
8165787 if asias success reopens the debate between individualism and collectivism which seemed closed after the cold war then its unlikely that the forces of individualism will sweep the field or even gain an edge
8165788 t he essence of a lot of the latest scientific research is that the western idea of individual choice is an illusion and the chinese are right to put first emphasis on social contexts

8165799 the ideal dosage may be higher than the recommended dietary allowance
8165800 the safe upper limit for vitamin c is 2 000 milligrams a day and there is a great track record with strong evidence that taking 500 milligrams daily is safe

8165831 the parish council would be very concerned to know that there was a possibility of skilled jobs being diluted in the village
8165832 there are relatively small numbers of jobs available in the village particularly for younger people
8165833 i think therell be a short term gain at the moment we always struggle to get skilled staff so in the short term youd probably pick up a few people
8165834 in the long term people go away from the industry which has got to work against us its an industry that is shrinking and it cant do us any good at all in the long term

8165857 we ended up with 90 kids and only 15 volunteers it was not as organized as i had planned but it turned out to be really fun
8165858 im excited to meet new people im looking forward to expanding relationships to this day i still keep in touch with my senior recruiter
8165859 just to see so many cradles lined up was amazing it was hard not to get emotional my only goal was to make some of the children smile
8165860 she had never been that far from home and all i kept thinking was what if her blood sugar dropped and she needed to get to a hospital
8165861 this is the last year we will organize a group for the diabetes walk but me and my family will continue to support jdrf until there is a cure
8165862 we havent decided to do anything other than continue the discussions and over time figure out what is the best thing to put on that property
8165863 we hope the childrens museum will be a major piece of the strategy
8165864 i wouldnt recommend this if i didnt think you would get five or six times the investment in return
8165865 i think we need to look at the plan and start implementing it
8165866 but its still exciting still exhilarating oh i miss the classroom sometimes i still want to put up bulletin boards and get the room set up but seeing all the children come back thats always exciting

8165895 we really make an effort to let people know were here and we like to partner with our first responders to let them know we appreciate what they do

8165930 by pluralism here i mean the coexistence within the one political community of groups who hold divergent and incompatible views with regard to religious questions those ultimate questions that concern the nature and destiny of man within a universe that stands under the reign of god pluralism therefore implies disagreement and dissension within the community but it also implies a community within which there must be agreement and consensus there is no small political problem here

8165941 es ist positiv zu bewerten dass bereits 71 der analysierten unternehmen ber eine eigene unternehmenswebsite verf gen die tatsache dass jedoch lediglich 28 dieser unternehmen und damit nur ein f nftel der gesamtmenge eine stellenrubrik in ihr internetangebot eingebunden haben deckt viel entwicklungspotential in sachen personalmarketing auf
8165942 wenn man in betracht zieht dass laut der letzten handelskammer untersuchung gut die h lfte der maschinenbau unternehmen schwierigkeiten bei der besetzung von stellen hat besteht hier verbesserungsbedarf
8165943 in zeiten eines faktischen fachkr ftemangels kann es sich kein unternehmen leisten interessierte kandidaten nicht ber offene stellen zu informieren

8165954 no le interesa respetar los derechos de las migrantes en arriaga chiapas tiene un centro de atenci n al migrante muy bonito como para 900 personas con personal amable y preparado pero afuera los agentes de migraci n abusan de las migrantes cada que pueden
8165955 los polic as de todos los colores est n al acecho de las migrantes una vez platicando con una chica del inm me dec a que a nadie le gustaba estar en las estaciones migratorias prefer an salir a las calles para extorsionar y robar a las y los migrantes
8165956 la peor parte en el tr nsito hacia nuestro pa s hacia estados unidos
8165957 as como hay quien los ayuda tambi n hay gente que sin ser parte de la delincuencia organizada se aprovecha de la situaci n de las migrantes
8165958 para reclamar al gobierno porque no hace nada para defender sus derechos
8165959 no est haciendo nada eficaz porque la sociedad civil no ha sido capaz de producir costos sociales y pol ticos para que el gobierno haga algo

8165962 a much tougher endeavor than i thought it would be
8165963 hes the only uw quarterback i have seen who could beat you three ways passing scrambling from called pass plays and option i would love to have seen the 1991 national championship team with him and his option abilities
8165964 his racial breakthrough as a black quarterback is historically significant
8165965 theres no question were going to be one of the top lines in the country
8165966 the only thing that kept us from breaking apart is our friendship weve learned the game of football together its basically like going out there and playing with my brothers
8165967 anything ive been through in my career juan has been through it tenfold
8165968 id see juan and i couldnt dare feel that bad about how much i hurt
8165969 theres not anything else im really good at besides football
8165970 hes just a lot more comfortable he was getting all the way to three today the third receiver in the progression he wasnt panicking it was 1 2 3 he just sees things better and hes more comfortable and thats experience thats what experience does for you
8165971 i feel a lot more comfortable than i was in the past
8165972 just being able to throw the ball with more confidence and poise and just knowing that im going to the right spots
8165973 theres no doubt that with his experience he will get better
8165974 but he needs everybody else around him to get better and get better quickly hes going to be relying on a lot of very young kids to be distributing the ball to
8165975 to basically start over that last year was a real challenge just because of the timing the anticipation all of those things that go into quarterback play
8165976 you are greatly aided by the guys around you and i say this not to be a debbie downer because the kids they have a lot of talent its just how quickly can they ascend the learning curve
8165977 a quarterbacks most success comes at times when everyone around them is improving and talented and that will be a major point of emphasis for that football team and jake and his development if the entire burden is on jake locker and his hamstrings it will be very difficult
8165978 i think we have a group of guys who will take pressure off him and make plays
8165979 its everybody its protection issues up front its guys breaking off routes
8165980 i give the analogy of imagining you are on a golf tee and you do 100 sit ups and 100 push ups and 50 jumping jacks and then you go hit your drive
8165981 when you run as much as he does its tough to keep your fundamentals and rhythm and timing i believe the less he runs the better passer he will be
8165982 i dont want him carrying the football as much as he did a year ago but i also know hes a huge weapon for us with the ball in his hands weve got to take advantage of that but i dont want to take advantage of that to the point where we get him beaten down
8165983 obviously coming out of high school and everybody talking about him it had to be a shocker having everybody talking about his passing accuracy
8165984 ill probably try to eat when i get on the bus
8165985 ill sit on the back so im close to the bathroom ill probably try to eat a little candy bar or something but im probably just going to throw it up anyway
8165986 i really didnt have a sense that hed be the starter because when i was running with the first team brandon was hurt so i thought when he came back he would be the one and i would have no problem being his sub
8165987 i was real surprised they had me there because he played there last year and had game experience and im just a freshman who has nothing so it was real surprising
8165988 its a wonderful sensation to have as a coach when you have a player who does that so its exciting and we are eager to get that combination of polk and quarterback jake locker on the field
8165989 i dont want to go down and mess up because im expected to do good already as a freshman
8165990 so its like real nerve wracking i just want to do the best i can and not let people down
8165991 i think about taking the field and it gives me chills
8165992 i cant believe i didnt quit on myself and kept pushing
8165993 he worked on it today on the treadmill and hes feeling pretty fine
8165994 attitude wise you can tell hes pretty confident in it
8165995 i took these last couple days off hoping that rest is going to kick it into gear and get it healthy
8165996 im going to try it again today and hopefully keep progressing throughout the week

8166030 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
8166031 stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy
8166032 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
8166033 russia is a great nation look how we have been treating it we need firmness not threats we must not threaten them because it will not work because everyone knows we are not going to war
8166034 to include more pro american oriented countries into the alliance
8166035 we have to be prepared to talk we cannot afford to isolate russia
8166036 imagine if we were forced to intervene militarily to defend georgia as a nato country on behalf of an obvious gambler which is clearly the way one should characterize georgian president mikheil saakashvili
8166037 the starting point of the military confrontation was georgias march into south ossetia we should not confuse things

8166039 is sending an emphatic message with global consequences the curtain has fallen on the era when nato steadily expanded into eastern europe and onwards to embrace the former republics of the soviet union and russia was able to respond with nothing more than bluster the balance of power in europe has fundamentally changed
8166040 m s all de la hist rica y a veces interminable polarizaci n de grupos conservadores de derecha y liberales de la izquierda en un tema de muy alta complejidad y controversia lo cierto es que entre los ministros por lo menos entre una mayor a prevalece un criterio universal a favor de la despenalizaci n de la interrupci n del embarazo dentro del margen de 12 semanas a pesar de que el colegiado de ministros ha sido motejado como un pu ado de conservadores
8166041 es altamente probable que al final del proceso una mayor a de ministros se pronuncien a favor de ratificar la constitucionalidad de la reforma lo que sin duda abrir la puerta para que los congresos locales hagan lo propio en realidad quienes impugnan la reforma lo que pretenden impedir es que se convierta en una tendencia de alcance nacional
8166042 the perils of a lower drinking age changing the drinking age from 21 to 18 would be impractical dangerous

8166046 people have been kind of up in arms but it seems like a fairly common practice
8166047 i do commend him for not singling out one particular site
8166048 if were really serious about making sure that marginalised and disadvantaged people get into the education system we have to look at incentives
8166049 the whole basis of success in education is around making sure that we affirm people we give them carrots we dont give them sticks
8166050 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8166051 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8166052 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8166053 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8166054 achja da war ja noch alles ziemlich sinnfrei ganz lustig aber irgendwie neee
8166055 barack obama must be inspiring but not too inspiring so as to seem a prophet and present his ideas clearly but not too clearly so as to seem simplistic and
8166056 the never ending television news cycle creates a false sense of urgency and forces reporters to follow the veins that have been mined instead of pursuing serious and in depth reporting
8166057 overall michelles speech was her attempt to trick people into believing shes not a radical elitist liberal with a dislike for her own country and it was good for what it was

8166064 crear nuevas presiones a nivel regional dentro del c ucaso y complicar las relaciones entre las potencias mundiales

8166066 the slowdown was a short term phenomenon as i look for deals and talk to people i have never seen a time in europe when there are so many good young companies being started he said i m not overly worried
8166067 about the need for more freedoms of speech and association in china
8166068 the argument here is whether the international community should support national level elections in china meaning that the democratically chosen leader would hold all the trump cards
8166069 wealth and honor are what every man desires but if they have been obtained in violation of moral principles they must not be kept
8166070 voinovich was alluding to the fact that were it not for the horrors of bolshevism the pre revolutionary russian political tradition would be regarded as so brutal that no sensitive person of good will could be a russian nationalist as it was the bolsheviks regularly killed in a few minutes more people than the romanovs managed in a century giving pre revolutionary russina history the retrospective luster of decency wisdom and compassion that it did not in the least deserve
8166071 i fear that chinas leaders and people will continue to feel a certain gnawing inchoate sense of deficiency and incompleteness in their quest for global respect until they find the strength to begin addressing the crucial but elusive issue of making china an ethical as well as an economic and military power

8166080 if as a nation we are serious about lifting overall student performance and addressing under performance and under achievement what we would have seen today is a statement of certainty from the prime minister with respect to new measures to ensure we lift overall performance and address under achievement
8166081 thats what australia needs we do not need a political sideshow in the form of schools watch as occurred today
8166082 were up for a negotiation which will be conditional on these quality educational benchmarks being met
8166083 thats what were on about so thats why we havent put forward concrete figures in the speech ive given today
8166084 whether states and territories agree remains to be seen in the final analysis but what we can do at the end of the day is fashion national partnerships with governments
8166085 and if various governments choose not to receive these additional payments then i think the country will say be it on their heads
8166086 alabama i guess i just have this feeling that there is lingering prejudice there but maybe thats totally unfair on my part
8166087 oh michigan definitely its a good thing they didnt seat us near them
8166088 i dont like states that dont vote for hillary so im really not happy with iowa right now

8166091 this man just took my chair knocked into me look at this
8166092 i am a clinton delegate and these obama delegates are mistreating us
8166093 to all check writing patrons writing a check from an account with insufficient funds or from a closed account is a crime
8166094 in an effort to assist this establishment with the prosecution of such offenses the searsport police department puts these patrons on notice that the police department will enforce violations to the fullest extent allowed by law
8166095 we give them five days to make the check good and that is within the law
8166096 if they fail to make the check valid we will go through the court system
8166097 there are people who write checks knowing that there is no money in their account but we also recognize that people make honest mistakes
8166098 i think the police officers here theyre evaluating each circumstance as it unfolds and theyre not jumping to conclusions they understand that a lot of times mistakes happen and that were human beings
8166099 it is the dirigo boards cost saving determinations that are being adjudicated i have made no prejudgment on those determinations
8166100 i nonetheless acknowledge that i have spoken publicly with positive remarks regarding the dirigo program the dirigo program itself however is not the issue for adjudication in this proceeding
8166101 were playing everything by ear well sit down with a big sigh of relief whenever and however its completed
8166102 these folks get to be mourned get to be remembered and get to be honored
8166103 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8166104 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8166105 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8166106 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8166107 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8166108 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8166109 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8166110 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8166111 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8166112 erst ab ca 6000 saisontickets sind wieder wieder ein volksclub

8166120 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8166121 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8166122 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
8166123 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8166124 regrettable and we reaffirm our attachment to georgias territorial integrity
8166125 its important that people of faith are being listened to just like other constituencies that were not marginalized
8166126 just because were participating in the process and engaging people who may not agree with us doesnt mean were just a mascot
8166127 lets be honest religion has been used and abused by politics
8166128 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
8166129 reaching out to us and im not naive as to why they want our votes
8166130 but they wont get them and keep them unless they continue the momentum of adopting policies that promote the sanctity of life

8166133 we want to make it loud and clear today that anyone that assists these fugitives will be held accountable

8166135 when it comes to social justice issues young people are ahead of the game
8166136 they know this kind of discrimination belongs to a previous time
8166137 this doesnt necessarily mean well be able to lead the charge and win it in other areas of the party but it recognises that young people have a different take to the rest of the party
8166138 even just changing the perception that this is uncontested ground in the alp is fantastic
8166139 civil unions could very well be necessary steps towards achieving that final goal of full equality but that needs to be in the context that all forms of relationship recognition should be equally available
8166140 im really proud that young labor has had the guts to speak out for young people and the gay and lesbian community
8166141 barack and michelle listened and they understood it was like talking with family it became clear that they are regular people
8166142 just bringing people together so real changes can be made that affect the everyday lives of people like me
8166143 joe from next door cannot end life on the earth
8166144 the power and the story how the crafted presidential narrative has determined political success from george washington to george w bush
8166145 you start out with almost an anti intellectual strain there i want someone whos like me so they can understand me and know what i need government to be doing
8166146 to have a bad bowling score is good people see you as human
8166147 no matter how educated you are how successful you are you still need to be just folks
8166148 you want someone who you can say hes like me but i know in a crisis situation he can handle it
8166149 everyone having the same rights a benchmark that we can be proud of that includes young people older people people in relationships and their children people who arent in relationships and dont have children
8166150 we have such a vast and diverse community in australia and some people arent being heard people turn to the gossip pages and the sport because politicians always seem to be banging on about the same things and dont seem to get to the heart of the matter
8166151 in six years time when looking back id like to think id helped try to unify some of that
8166152 that could end up being quite good for the greens although the last election was pretty big and exhausting
8166153 the centre has been very important worldwide in contextualising sexual and drug related behaviours and elucidating how potentially risky practices are influenced and shaped by social processes and situations
8166154 our challenge now is to use our expertise to improve the appropriateness and effective ness of treatment prevention and care
8166155 the measure of a society can be seen in how we treat our young our old and our dying

8166162 auch die erw gungen des landgerichts zur verh ngung einer zweiw chigen ordnungshaft sind angesichts der von dem schuldner an den tag gelegten hartn ckigkeit nicht zu beanstanden
8166163 in my first year the combination of being a bit shy and work schedules meant i couldnt be active at all i just went to the big events
8166164 lots of people are scared and disempowered so we ran a self defence workshop this year
8166165 the burn out rate is incredible for people with passion its hard to say no and many dont have support at home
8166166 id have to do less study which would be devastating i love being at uni
8166167 this year i really got a sense that working in the queer community would be amazing
8166168 a job with acon or twenty10 would be dream worthy but i want to do another degree so its a few years off
8166169 the family is an important part of the bedrock of our society and no family should be discriminated against
8166170 both during this debate and also the debate of the civil unions act the opposition leader has absented himself from the chamber
8166171 its time the opposition leader explained to same sex families and couples if he thinks they deserve the same rights as other canberrans and if not why not
8166172 unfortunately both commonwealth governments made it clear they would undemocratically override the civil partnerships bill if passed by the act legislative assembly
8166173 hes going to contribute in one way or another im not sure what it will be yet

8166177 then join the official tko fan club and be a part of takeo spikes official team
8166178 hes a tough hard nosed football player everything a team could want in its locker room
8166179 hes consistent not up one game and down the next he studies the game he watches a lot of film i think hed be a good coach someday
8166180 we have a lot of talent especially up front some guys who probably wont get recognition on a larger scale like aubrayo franklin and ray mcdonald those guys come off the ball and they play hard theres so much potential on this team
8166181 everybody talks to each other and says dont tip off your stance here or we expect you to make that play its constructive criticism
8166182 one of the best technicians as a young linebacker that ive seen hes never out of position to make a play some guys may be all over the place where they take false steps hes not going to give you the false steps he understands what he has to do with his steps before the ball is even snapped that has to do with formation recognition
8166183 in buffalo you never could gauge what you were going to get until the night before
8166184 one time we had freezing rain the turf was damn near frozen it was 2 degrees wind chill but i enjoyed it i like playing in the cold better than the hot
8166185 i was crying thinking i had silver and to get gold i was a blubbering mess
8166186 i want to thank absolutely everyone who helped my partner lachlan and my mum here to support me and watch me get gold because it was so important to have those two people here with me
8166187 he is who he is and doesnt pretend to be something different
8166188 he has revealed to the world his depression how he overcame it and succeeded how he feels and who he loves that is why he is so popular

8166190 turkey attaches importance to the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia and is highly concerned about the recent developments
8166191 if we can get him 15 20 snaps in friday nights exhibition finale against san diego that would be good
8166192 although theyve been banged up theyve done a better job
8166193 were not just there for people with the illness were also there to support the family loved ones and carers who are also affected by the illness
8166194 the group has been set up specifically to help men in our area because for some reason men still seem to have difficulties talking about their health issues and seeking help
8166195 there is a real lack of services for people with hiv in this area i have seen statistics from this area which show that a lot of people are having to leave the area where they live to get hiv services that they need
8166196 so were hoping that this service will provide some assistance although at this point in time its still difficult weve been having difficulties with letting the public know that we exist and as of yet the group is still small
8166197 were planning to put that money towards buying a second hand computer that we can use as an organisation as well as enable people who come to the group to use
8166198 weve had a lot of support from organisations like acon and the bobby goldsmith foundation who have been kind enough to offer us some information resources but we are still kind of in need of some assistance if we are to keep this going
8166199 a whole contingent of police are there every sunday taking them away from doing other things and the hotel has still got seven years on its licence
8166200 currently researching the site its history and issues graham will help develop design strategies for the area after a series of public workshops later this year following the workshops the city will prepare a concept for council
8166201 this project is an australian first its all about the positives its all about inspiring others
8166202 there is a view in society that you cannot get out of the trap of substance abuse thats just not true thousands of people around the nation have become clean or sober and disproved that idea
8166203 positive stories has been developed to clearly demonstrate that help is available and that it is possible to become drug free
8166204 the government is committed to tackling drug and alcohol abuse and hopefully this project can play a part in helping us to meet the challenge
8166205 this will be an action packed event with nonstop games
8166206 this will be a great chance to see our state league teams mixed into a more social setting which everyone can enjoy
8166207 if you are not in a team we will endeavour to place you in one there are always gaps and extras required on the day
8166208 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8166209 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8166210 we think it is against the territorial integrity of georgia and we cannot accept it
8166211 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens
8166212 so we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent

8166251 as our buyers look for new quality suppliers from india private sourcing events provide an ideal platform connecting them with a range of pre screened suppliers able to meet their specific standards
8166252 as we increase our sourcing from india we are working with many suppliers for the first time and that increases our risk as suppliers we will meet at private sourcing events have been pre screened this helps us greatly reduce our risk and find quality suppliers with more sourcing options in less time
8166253 we are eager to expand to new markets and we are now focused on producing high end products private sourcing events give us the opportunity to meet the international buyers who are looking for our quality products this is an incredible opportunity for us

8166265 mr anand and mr khan are prohibited from appearing in this court delhi high court or courts subordinate to it for four months from today however they are free to discharge their professional duties in terms of consultation advice conferences opinions etc

8166325 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8166326 i dont have anything to tell you about senator mccains vice presidential selection process
8166327 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8166328 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8166329 do we want four more years of bush mccain or do we want the change we need
8166330 there is only one candidate from the middle class that understands the middle class
8166331 george bush has put the middle class in a hole and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8166332 if you think the last eight years have been good you need to vote for john mccain
8166333 if you drilled everywhere if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has
8166334 its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past

8166339 my biggest question is who is going to take on mccain
8166340 barack is never going to be a red meat attack dog politician
8166341 the thing that matters most is what the candidate says
8166342 theres a disparity between the reality of john mccain and the way hes perceived
8166343 i think joe biden will go toe to toe with mccain they picked him for that

8166387 supply will get tight in the long term and prices of palm oil may rise in the fourth quarter
8166388 demand will pick up from the food side as well as biodiesel
8166389 recently prices dropped from over us 1 200 a ton in rotterdam to us 825
8166390 last week prices rebounded to us 880 us 900 although they fell again yesterday to us 860 prices will remain there and are not going further down
8166391 thats why for some time they dont buy any more palm oil causing prices to drop to such a low level
8166392 were encouraging the industry to clear their stocks and asking companies not to import
8166393 making biofuel from palm oil has become economically viable now
8166394 so you can see they are having quite good margins now with palm oil trading below rm2 500 a ton

8166412 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings
8166413 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8166414 our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8166415 im so happy i have been fighting to get treatment for over a year and a half so this is the best news ive had since i started to lose my sight

8166453 es ist das besondere anliegen der landesregierung eine hohe k nstlerische qualit t des theater und konzertwesens im land zu sichern und gleichzeitig den schwerpunkt auf langfristig tragf hige personelle und finanzielle strukturen zu legen dabei wird das land den theater und orchestertr gern trotz der sich stark ver ndernden finanziellen rahmenbedingungen als verl sslicher partner zur seite stehen und den beitrag zur theater und orchesterf rderung bis 2020 bei 35 8 millionen euro pro jahr auf hohem niveau stabil halten
8166454 das land gibt den theatern und theater tragenden kommunen eine finanzielle sicherheit die sie f r ihre arbeit brauchen und mit der sie langfristig ber viele jahre hinweg planen k nnen
8166455 trotz dieser gro en aufgaben die vor dem land insgesamt stehen trotz dramatisch sinkender einnahmen und trotz des bev lkerungsr ckgangs verpflichtet sich das land seinen beitrag zur f rderung der theater und orchesterlandschaft bis 2020 stabil bei 35 8 millionen euro j hrlich zu halten und macht damit deutlich welche bedeutung den theatern und orchestern beigemessen wird mit den zur verf gung stehenden mitteln auszukommen wird keine leichte aufgabe werden weder f r das land noch f r die theater und orchester tragenden kommunen aber wenn es uns gelingt gemeinsam langfristig tragf hige strukturen aufzubauen dann k nnen wir die hohe k nstlerische qualit t unserer theater und orchester halten und m glichst ausbauen vor allem wird deutlich dass angesichts der rahmenbedingungen einseitige und unabgestimmte entscheidungen an einzelnen h usern die theater und orchesterlandschaft grunds tzlich in frage stellen wir m ssen alle f r den kulturstandort mecklenburg vorpommern zusammenr cken und gemeinsam l sungen finden daf r bietet das konzept der landesregierung die grundlage
8166456 unumg nglich ist aus meiner sicht dass sich die regionen mehr als bisher in die theater einbringen alle gemeinden und landkreise im umfeld eines theaters oder orchesters profitieren direkt von dem standort

8166462 individuelle f rderung ist die voraussetzung f r erfolgreiches lernen und eine gelungene bildungsbiographie die durch das bildungsbarometer aufgezeigten problembereiche sind markant der jetzige zustand der lehrerausbildung ist angesichts der notwendigen f rderung nicht hinnehmbar dadurch entsteht ein ungeheuerer volkswirtschaftlicher schaden wenn wir heute nicht strategisch die richtigen weichen stellen und das notwendige geld f r einen ausbau der f rderung in die hand nehmen dann werden wir das problem fehlender schulabschl sse und sozialer benachteiligung nicht in den griff bekommen ich setze deshalb auf den bildungsgipfel im oktober in berlin

8166465 i was reading a lot of food blogs at the time and just itching to create my own and take part in the community and teh discourse about food and cooking that was starting to develop
8166466 we love feeding people and have always loved serving elaborate multi course meals for friends and family running the restaurant sounded like fun a way to push ourselves to constantly experiment with food and reach out to share it with more people

8166474 hes never boastful and hes very mature for his age
8166475 other players are always impressed with jakes abilities at such a young age
8166476 hes not only a good athlete but a very good strategist who understands the mental part of the game
8166477 there are a lot of angles on a racquetball court and jake is getting very good at understanding those concepts and putting them into play he easily outstripped the competition at concord
8166478 racquetball is very good for developing kids hand eye coordination
8166479 its very good for developing agility quickness and side to side movement its a great sport for young athletes
8166480 racquetball is great for kids because its fast and fun
8166481 its easy to pick up a racquet and enjoy it right away and because the court is enclosed you dont have to chase the ball the way you do in tennis
8166482 looking back we both believe that was the beginning of everything
8166483 we all need to be attuned to our body it gives you hints little signs that you should never ignore
8166484 with every test they took something would drop off the list but the one thing that alarmed me the one thing that never dropped off the list was cancer it just always moved up and at that point i started to prepare myself for the worst
8166485 colorectal cancer screening can reduce colorectal cancer deaths by detecting the disease at an early more treatable stage
8166486 in addition screening that leads to detecting and removing pre cancerous polyps can prevent colorectal cancer
8166487 anyone experiencing symptoms should talk to a health care provider
8166488 theres strength in her thats just amazing it lifts me up
8166489 shes still fighting and she still has a good outlook
8166490 all members communicate with our core audiences fans sponsors media in english throughout their careers on the lpga
8166491 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain
8166492 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par
8166493 we read it in the press first and almost concurrently got something from the tour we run a tournament the cn canadian womens open you would have thought thatd have given tournament operators a heads up
8166494 theyre trying to help players but the area is so sensitive theyre saying that unless you speak our language we wont let you participate in our game
8166495 this is an american tour its important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience

8166502 this latest research confirms we have a serious problem of self harm in the uk particularly among women
8166503 what we normally do is look at three year rolling averages
8166504 when we compare the suicide rates between 2000 and 2002 with those in 2005 and 2007 there is an overall decrease
8166505 nobody ever likes to see an increase obviously but we cannot focus on one year because it may be a blip rather than a trend

8166514 wir wollen diesem land einen neuen gesellschaftsvertrag anbieten einen neuen pakt zwischen den b rgern sowie zwischen b rgern und dem staat
8166515 it was a lot similar to those games last year very much so
8166516 i think any time somebody pops off i think it catches some fire to it between the media and the fans and our players
8166517 i think our players hear that and they kind of take that to heart they get up and they get more determined and everything thats kind of like fighting words it kind of sets them off
8166518 if you notice we seem like we are in a more business frame of mind so that means we dont particularly want to associate with them i like that ive always liked that i think when we come to the ballpark when i put my uniform on were going to come out here and beat you i dont have any friends on the field when were playing weve got a couple guys like that and i really love that part about them

8166520 andys changed his life around 180 degrees and as a coaching staff weve seen the positive impact hes made in the program
8166521 summertime is clearly more challenging we need to have all the individuals who can add something to the case to help people make decisions
8166522 i cant answer that i do have an opinion but i dont want to say anything
8166523 the toughest period of trading in its life as a public company
8166524 escuchar a charly a todo volumen y abrir las ventanas de tu departamento de tu oficina de tu negocio de tu auto
8166525 nichts nichts konnte mich davon abhalten zu diesem ganz speziellen parteitag heute abend zu kommen
8166526 hey look a presidents job is to create jobs not to export jobs and the idea that we are not willing to take the prime minister of canada and the president of mexico to the mat to make this agreement work is just a lack of presidential leadership
8166527 there are aspects of the free trade agreement that the united states is not happy with and so my expectation is that there will be a reopening of nafta
8166528 youll hear biden say things like we dont want uncle sam treated like uncle sucker
8166529 its a workable approach that should allow the united states to continue to have good trade relations with its closest trading partners including canada and mexico
8166530 obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8166531 i havent spent the last 35 years in the trenches to see another republican in the white house
8166532 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me and who contributed so much to work as hard for barack obama in the next few months
8166533 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8166534 we need barack obama and joe biden in the white house
8166535 proud supporter of barack obama ms clinton dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8166536 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8166537 i know a little bit about how the white house works and with michelle obama we are going to have someone who can answer that phone
8166538 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8166539 colour copying and printing should only be used for client presentations
8166540 presentations should be printed double sided to reduce unnecessary paper usage
8166541 u s recession and recovery u v or w shaped
8166542 trying to make a desperate situation look sort of technical its not that much of a fuss the big boys can take care of it dont you worry
8166543 except the big boys here their trousers are getting a little short im afraid
8166544 im not going to vote for mccain but i might not vote for obama either
8166545 i was such a proud supporter of hillary and chair of her campaign but right now im so fired up to elect barack obama
8166546 its more disappointment than anything and theyll get over it
8166547 i dont think any of them is crazy enough to think theyre better off with mccain
8166548 if obama had lost and by such a small margin no one would call his supporters whiners its so pejorative
8166549 i hope it doesnt do any damage because we certainly dont need that
8166550 its a historic part of my life that a woman got so far
8166551 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8166552 my goal is to provide an alternative not to free the mac os
8166553 what we want to do is to provide an alternative an option its not that people dont want to use mac os many people are open to the idea but theyre not used to spending an exorbitant amount of money on something that is essentially generic hardware
8166554 together we can form joint companies with pdvsa and that way we can continue providing our experience and knowledge of the business
8166555 no es republicana ni dem crata sino una pol tica estadounidense inteligente que har que nuestro pa s sea m s seguro
8166556 las voces de los estadounidenses que comparten la visi n de barack de hacer que estados unidos sea m s fuerte y m s seguro
8166557 no desconfi nada hasta que me puso el cuchillo en el cuello
8166558 durante dos a os no se han dado las subvenciones porque hab a que desarrollar la ley de las subvenciones y hab a que reglamentarla se ha aprobado una ordenanza para decir c mo se regula el reparto de las subvenciones
8166559 el taxi es un servicio p blico pero un negocio privado

8166561 no recibir gol en la ida nos da una peque a ventaja
8166562 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8166563 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8166564 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8166565 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed it further inflames an already tense situation in the region
8166566 direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity
8166567 it is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these u n provisions express their will to have an independent existence any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not
8166568 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order
8166569 should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussions among the parties
8166570 container shippers could see losses in the fourth quarter and in 2009 amid high oil prices and a slowing global economy
8166571 high costs will still be the toughest challenge faced by container shipping companies
8166572 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8166573 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8166574 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8166575 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8166576 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8166577 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8166578 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8166579 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8166580 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8166581 senator currie in my opinion is guilty of making a terrible mistake
8166582 knowing him i believe it was absent mindedness still he lobbied the government on behalf of a private entity for personal profit
8166583 it is certainly something that will be undertaken by a legislative ethics committee
8166584 and i think that he needs to be allowed to explain exactly what occurred
8166585 i was of the impression that we would wait until the investigation has concluded and decide from there whether there is any basis for any action
8166586 if you miss the train leaving the station you have to dig a little deeper for a ticket
8166587 there were a lot of people who supported senator obama early and i was not one of them
8166588 he understandably feels an amount of loyalty and obligation i am sure to make sure that they are given an opportunity especially if they risked a lot politically by coming out early for him
8166589 four years ago he was a 400 hitter in triple a ball now hes batting 285 in the big leagues
8166590 hes made a huge leap in terms of his career in terms of responsibilities
8166591 if you step back from the poll numbers he had a very successful two years as governor
8166592 i know hes taken a few arrows but he is still standing
8166593 i saw mark at a clinic and he said coach youve got to come down here
8166594 a bunch of us at blaine said lets go and after we did it once we were hooked
8166595 the thing thats really awesome about those guys is theyre so open about what they do and so willing to help
8166596 they literally will block out a day to spend with us when we get there
8166597 a lot of it is learning how they run their programs and its fun to watch their coaches coach we try to find schools that are similar schematically how do they block certain fronts what formations are they running
8166598 well spend two or three nights watching what they do
8166599 so we go down with questions and were pretty well prepared
8166600 my picturetown and hdmi compatible sharing and organizing your images has never been easier the nikon d90 will be on sale in late september and retail manufacturerd at a retail price of 899

8166603 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8166604 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8166605 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8166606 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8166607 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8166608 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8166609 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8166610 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8166611 theres always delays somewhere but its a major thing to have an faa grid system go down
8166612 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8166613 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision
8166614 its important that people of faith are being listened to just like other constituencies that were not marginalized
8166615 just because were participating in the process and engaging people who may not agree with us doesnt mean were just a mascot
8166616 lets be honest religion has been used and abused by politics
8166617 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
8166618 reaching out to us and im not naive as to why they want our votes
8166619 but they wont get them and keep them unless they continue the momentum of adopting policies that promote the sanctity of life
8166620 id like to see obama address that say that voice is no longer welcome
8166621 i certainly didnt feel used obviously politics is politics i dont want to be naive i also dont want to be cynical
8166622 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8166623 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for all the people in this country that feel invisible
8166624 im here tonight as a proud mother a proud democrat a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8166625 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8166626 and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8166627 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8166628 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8166629 i havent spent the last 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal healthcare helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfils the hopes of our people
8166630 but it will be impossible if we dont fight to put a democrat back into the white house
8166631 he built his campaign on the fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up not the top down and he knows that government must be about we the people not we the favoured few
8166632 and when barack obamas in the white house hell revitalise our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8166633 as i recall we did it before with president clinton and the democrats
8166634 and if we do our part well do it again with president obama
8166635 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8166636 he has served our country with honour and courage but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8166637 well john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatise social security and in 2008 he still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8166638 now with an agenda like that it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8166639 a strong leader a good man who understands both the economic stresses here at home and the strategic challenges abroad
8166640 barack and michelle listened and they understood it was like talking with family it became clear that they are regular people
8166641 just bringing people together so real changes can be made that affect the everyday lives of people like me
8166642 joe from next door cannot end life on the earth
8166643 the power and the story how the crafted presidential narrative has determined political success from george washington to george w bush
8166644 you start out with almost an anti intellectual strain there i want someone whos like me so they can understand me and know what i need government to be doing
8166645 to have a bad bowling score is good people see you as human
8166646 no matter how educated you are how successful you are you still need to be just folks
8166647 you want someone who you can say hes like me but i know in a crisis situation he can handle it
8166648 when i got to college they asked me where did you get those hands i said i was afraid to miss the ball because hed let your hear about it
8166649 some of the old diehards thought the way to do it was the woody hayes mentality and for all the right reasons weve evolved more into the tony dungy mode emphasizing the positive thats good
8166650 and the participation numbers reflect it we have a lot of great coaches in minnesota who coach that way the days of making them run and throw up are over
8166651 alabama i guess i just have this feeling that there is lingering prejudice there but maybe thats totally unfair on my part
8166652 oh michigan definitely its a good thing they didnt seat us near them
8166653 i dont like states that dont vote for hillary so im really not happy with iowa right now
8166654 what can i tell you i just dont like oklahoma
8166655 were from hawaii we dont talk stink about other states
8166656 this man just took my chair knocked into me look at this
8166657 i am a clinton delegate and these obama delegates are mistreating us
8166658 saya tidak senang mengenai cara saya bermain saya hanya senang mengenai kemenangan kami berdua bermain sangat ketat ini tidaklah mudah menghadapi petenis prancis lainnya
8166659 saya sudah tak sabar dan tidak ingin kalah dua kali dengan pemain yang sama berturut turut khususnya dekat dengan kekalahan saya sangat kemenangan ini
8166660 i remember going to the supermarket and buying butter for my older children lizzie who had never had butter in her life would grab the packet and gnaw into it
8166661 it was really disconcerting i would be thinking what is going on here is this purely fed child why would she need to do this
8166662 we do the same thing the vikings and just about everybody else does
8166663 we can ask for plays from the right hash in the fourth quarter when theres a full moon any variable you want
8166664 even in the summer when were hanging out with our football friends well take out some football film and well end up watching that just to see what we did last year and what we can improve on
8166665 niven said a good way to help hospitals stem financial losses is to spread rumors in spanish within the latino community that emergency rooms are killing patients in order to harvest their organs for transplants
8166666 people want border security and to have laws enforced but they also understand there are people here working who are probably good for the economy
8166667 in a moment where the average american is suffering in this economic downturn people are always looking for a cause to point to
8166668 were all immigrants no ones saying we dont appreciate people who take time to do it the right way
8166669 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8166670 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8166671 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8166672 confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8166673 failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8166674 barack obama has called for strong american leadership and renewing strong alliances to finish the fight against al qaida and press russia to live up to its obligations
8166675 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny
8166676 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8166677 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8166678 if youre so rich like me you cant even recall how many houses you own if you love the bush tax cuts because it means you get to invest more of the money youll never use while most of the country goes without food heat and medical care and if you want to reward me after totally failing to do my job as a senator for an entire year vote for me
8166679 he gonna get it this time we need to teach him how to hide better
8166680 miss dusty ill tell her and meet yall at the tree house

8166692 has a history of terror in this hemisphere and its linkages to the bombings in buenos aires are pretty well established
8166693 weve basically taken a ton of lessons that weve learned from lonelygirl15 and katemodern and were applying it to this new series trying to make it more accessible to a passive audience
8166694 during the week rather than it being five videos that are these posts that the characters are making leading up to this episode its going to be a text blog maybe a photo post its not all going to be video content
8166695 i love buffy and im a big joss whedon fan
8166696 some of the commenters on our forum were on the original buffy forum back in the day they were calling the world of lg15 originally the breenaverse
8166697 in general its certainly great to have the big traditional people and new media companies producing content for this space
8166698 it helps consolidate the medium it makes advertisers feel more comfortable and it just makes the market bigger
8166699 wow thats so simple how do these music industry people not understand or at least give it a try
8166700 it would be even better if we could setup terminator with devilspie i will have to find out and get back to you on that
8166701 strong middle class message about job killing trade agreements taking on the oil industry

8166733 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8166734 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8166735 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8166736 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8166737 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8166738 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8166739 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8166740 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8166741 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8166742 barack and michelle listened and they understood it was like talking with family it became clear that they are regular people
8166743 just bringing people together so real changes can be made that affect the everyday lives of people like me
8166744 joe from next door cannot end life on the earth
8166745 the power and the story how the crafted presidential narrative has determined political success from george washington to george w bush
8166746 you start out with almost an anti intellectual strain there i want someone whos like me so they can understand me and know what i need government to be doing
8166747 to have a bad bowling score is good people see you as human
8166748 no matter how educated you are how successful you are you still need to be just folks
8166749 you want someone who you can say hes like me but i know in a crisis situation he can handle it
8166750 the brief was to highlight the fact that rsg plays proudly afrikaans and sa music in a certain time slot so we took a tongue in cheek knock at big international bands and musicians
8166751 it started with bon jo wie as a joke but after it got a few laughs around the office we decided to explore it further
8166752 we hope this meeting requested by many people in the community will help clarify where we stand
8166753 the development may still happen but we continue to contest it
8166754 it showed you that you always play the game out
8166755 400 pages of summarized attacks near attacks and incidents against at risk persons all over the world from 1960 2007 more than 1400 entries
8166756 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
8166757 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
8166758 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
8166759 the civil war ended in 1865 unless you live in the south
8166760 the situation with robbie is still up in the air so he wont be involved against grimsby
8166761 these things do take time especially when the agent gets involved
8166762 im not unsure about robbie im just unsure as to when it will get done
8166763 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8166764 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8166765 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8166766 its not only the weather that im not happy about here in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8166767 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8166768 he was putting shopping into the boot of the car and she reversed into him
8166769 a woman was in an alfa romeo and a man was helping direct her into a space
8166770 she accidentally accelerated and pinned him to the car in the parking space behind which was a saab
8166771 the man was not seriously hurt but was taken to royal berkshire hospital
8166772 i put the lettuce down on my worktop and when i picked it up the dead frog was left lying there
8166773 it was absolutely disgusting my children could have eaten that
8166774 anyone could have eaten that if they were short sighted
8166775 i really dont think that is good enough my children could have been poisoned
8166776 i really dont have much luck with sainsburys i bought a loaf of bread in there last year and found a bug in it they gave me a voucher then i didnt think it would happen again this was too much i mean it
8166777 i nearly had a heart attack when i saw it
8166778 we take our commitment to the quality and safety of all our products very seriously and this kind of incident is very rare indeed we are very disappointed that this complaint was not handled to mrs phillips and her daughters complete satisfaction
8166779 due to the reading festival we had nowhere to park we were prohibited from parking anywhere near our house
8166780 i admit it was wrong to park in the car park because there were signs warning people not to but i had nowhere else to go
8166781 the council has introduced temporary restrictions in a number of roads near the festival site one of these temporary restrictions refer to richfield avenue the north and south sides and for the entire length of the road as this is the main thoroughfare for the many thousands of festival goers
8166782 this was a successful operation which i hope sent out a clear message that using the railway to transport drugs regardless of quantity will not be tolerated
8166783 some people came up with what they thought were pretty clever ways of concealing drug supplies inside tent poles chocolate spread jars and hair gel tubs for example when searched and arrested however it was clear they didnt feel quite so clever
8166784 those who did engage in criminal activity were dealt with accordingly but it is important to point out that the vast majority of festival goers were good spirited law abiding and co operated with officers fully
8166785 i feel the event is getting dangerous ive been going to the festival for quite a long time
8166786 there were many instances of dangerous crowd surging at exits and toilet facilities
8166787 this is the first time i have ever been scared at the festival and im a big guy
8166788 i very much regret taking my wife and son they were terrified and totally traumatised by the crushes
8166789 at some point in the future this festival will end in tragedy unless the numbers are reduced back to 60 000 which is safer
8166790 we left early on sunday after the massive crushes in both the gents and ladies toilet facilities my sister in law got buried under a dozen people and was so traumatised she didnt stop vomiting until 4am monday morning
8166791 the security guy admitted there were too many people to control
8166792 i am angry my sister who has been to 16 reading festivals said she wouldnt go back
8166793 she said its not safe there were people running round putting gas canisters on tents and shouting and screaming trampling on tents and trampling on people in the tents
8166794 we take the health and safety of everyone who attends the festival very seriously and we will be discussing the concerns mr bond has raised with the organisers
8166795 there is room for reasonable disagreement about salaries and other workplace issues
8166796 now if i had bet on that horse he wouldnt have won
8166797 i think people would be pleasantly surprised to see this little town
8166798 we have people who spend the whole weekend here two nights and i feel sorry for them
8166799 when i drove into this town i went whht this is it
8166800 its quaint its easy to get to and its one turn off 95
8166801 a lot of places say theyre family style but they use frozen food
8166802 they dont have good home cooking like youd have at grandmothers house

8166807 as our work involves using glow in the dark paints on a daily basis in childrens rooms it was important to find a totally safe paint that would not have adverse effects on us during the application stage and also to the child using the room once each job was completed with the introduction of our new superstarz range of paints we now have that peace of mind
8166808 i am delighted now that benjamin sleeps not only with the light off but also with his door shut this is something i thought we would never achieve but now he cant wait to see his ceiling

8166816 demonstrate that impaired breathing during sleep can lead to serious brain injury that disrupts memory and thinking
8166817 the reduced size of the mammillary bodies suggest that they ve suffered a harmful event resulting in sizable cell loss the fact that patients memory problems continue despite treatment for their sleep disorder implies a long lasting brain injury
8166818 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
8166819 researchers have speculated that tumors give off different odors but we re the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odors
8166820 within a few years it s reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctor s office it s a real possibility
8166821 because when you re dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you don t want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesn t get treated and you don t want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so it s really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed

8166829 people who have central auditory processing disorder capd can hear perfectly well but they have trouble making sense of what they are hearing
8166830 its confusing for them because they get low marks are rejected socially and dont understand why therefore they conclude that it must be because theyre stupid
8166831 what makes things worse is that due to similar behavioural symptoms capd is often confused with and diagnosed as attention deficit hyperactive disorder adhd

8166837 i really wish everyone in tennis would get the word usage correct a grand slam is when you sweep in one year all four major tournaments the australian open the french open wimbledon and the u s open
8166838 if you win the u s open you will have one a major tournament not a grand slam you cannot say pete sampras has won 14 grand slams he has won 14 majors roger federer has won 12 major titles not 12 grand slams ana ivanovic did not win her first grand slam title at the french open she won her first major title
8166839 rod laver won two grand slams one in 1962 and another in 1969 and overall he won 11 major singles titles
8166840 j ack crawford the stylish australian of the 1930s had no idea when he departed his homeland by steamship in the spring of 1933 that he would unknowingly be the instigator of a concept eventually known as the grand slam
8166841 in paris jack became the first non frenchman to seize the championship of france dethroning henri cochet of france 8 6 6 1 6 3 then crossing the channel to london he lifted the wimbledon title from another californian ellsworth vines in a splendid final 4 6 11 9 6 2 2 6 6 4
8166842 nobody had won those three majors in a row but jack had enough
8166843 the prospect of his winning that one too intrigued a new york times columnist john kieran
8166844 if you know nothing about tennis this book is for you and if you know everything about tennis hah bud knows more so this book is for you too

8166859 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport

8166866 we expect wpi inflation to increase to 12 82 percent year on year from 12 63 percent in the previous week due to higher prices of food articles rubber sugar paper products oilseeds textiles rubber and plastic products
8166867 two indicators show that demand as of now is strong non food credit and manufactured product prices
8166868 our winter schedule is slower in the period from january to early march so were matching supply to demand

8166878 the legacy of these games is ultimately up to the chinese people
8166879 you can get big headlines back home by slating the oppressive regime but there is a risk of going too far
8166880 it is disgraceful this night of british pride has been sullied
8166881 when i first got interested in politics all the quality papers had an entire page reporting mps speeches there would be the most salient point reported each morning
8166882 perfect examples of what a beautiful young chinese woman looks like
8166883 it would be even better if we could setup terminator with devilspie i will have to find out and get back to you on that
8166884 theyve kept a couple of trees in the front by the highway to hide it and have cleared everything in the back its completely gone
8166885 the trees have fallen onto the wetland and are lying there its very frustrating were expecting to do a roadside protest in the next few days but it seems like its a done deal
8166886 we feel that the municipality should be on site to observe what is going on the players in this are so big and our group doesnt have the experts like biologists who can properly assess what we are losing we have concerned citizens but everything is moving quickly

8166889 i always liked my meats and big pastas and heavy flavours
8166890 i worked in hotels where they did all kinds of dishes from all over italy but i didnt live or work in the south i couldnt do that sort of cooking in my own restaurant it wouldnt feel authentic
8166891 the food might be new to some people but its not strange
8166892 these are classic combinations they go together for a reason
8166893 personally i wouldnt want to eat that in 25 degree weather but thats what people want and theyre ordering it like crazy
8166894 city management claims council knew about it but councillors say they basically knew nothing about it
8166895 if theres conflict between city management and city council what does that lead taxpayers to believe is going on behind the doors at city hall
8166896 what we were able to do and were very fortunate to do was take advantage of someone who was in the community who actually does this work across the province at a much higher rate and is in pretty high demand and we were able to employ her services on some targeted projects as they were required
8166897 if that were necessary the practical process would be to do something deemed necessary and then immediately have it ratified by council at the next meeting of council
8166898 im bringing her anyway if someone finds a better home for her down the line then fine
8166899 but she has to be out of there by the end of this month and im not going to let anyone euthanize this cat
8166900 building a cage is all right as long as it meets the standards
8166901 but if he takes the cat hell be breaking the bylaw
8166902 what theyre concerned about mainly is the first access to the skilled trades
8166903 there is nothing in his presence that aids encourages abets in any way the conduct of any of the individuals however culpable they may or may not be
8166904 there is a good deal of circumstantial evidence presented by the crown but it doesnt stand alone
8166905 there is no reasonable alternative to the theory of the crown
8166906 simple acts of kindness dont amount to culpability in cases such as this
8166907 in our law we generally speaking do not have an affirmative duty to act and the failure to do so does not make you guilty of a criminal offence
8166908 if you are here on a visit you think this is bizarre when this is where you live it is more than bizarre it is tragic
8166909 then they are back at main and hastings with nowhere to live
8166910 they still are mentally ill or still have a drug addiction
8166911 im not saying on day 2 after the court opens were going to be unable to fulfill our mandate i dont know that yet
8166912 i dont know if were going to be short of resources when we start i do know though in the big picture there is a need for more resources
8166913 were coming on stream a bit ahead of the new ones being built but they are coming along as we get going
8166914 what we are not seeing outside of those communities is a chain of transmission
8166915 if we saw sustained transmission not just the sporadic cases
8166916 dr patrick said diseases like mumps have become so rare that parents often dont think their children need vaccines
8166917 its a bit of a circular thing if you succeed with a vaccine people dont see the vaccine around for a while and they think we dont need it
8166918 there needs to be a responsibility that if you are in a susceptible phase of having the illness you dont spread it to someone else you do stay at home and i think that should be societys expectation of people whore going to take a risk that way
8166919 running and losing narrowly is the best thing that could have happened to me
8166920 i got a couple of nasty e mails and a couple of cranky phone calls
8166921 i was prepared for a lot more than i got
8166922 one way or another thank god itll be over tomorrow
8166923 i would have been a lot more excited to be a government mp than an opposition backbencher
8166924 give me your card well have it on the air and one the net in a few days and ill let you know where to find it on the dial or how to i pod it
8166925 coaching at milwaukee has been a great experience and i learned so much from our student athletes
8166926 it was an honor to be part of this program for the last two years and i want to thank both our teams for that i could not be more excited for erica and for the teams as she will continue to move the program forward she was a huge part of the success the last two years and this transition is a great situation for our student athletes
8166927 it is great to have a seamless transition in the leadership of our swimming and diving programs for this coming season
8166928 erica has already had a major impact on the growing success of our teams over the last couple of years and she has a bright future ahead of her dave has done a wonderful job positioning our programs for success but the opportunity he received to coach in the big ten was just too good to pass up together dave and erica have laid down a solid foundation and we want to keep the momentum in our swimming and diving programs going in the right direction
8166929 this is an incredible opportunity for me here at uwm
8166930 dave griffore and i have worked hard the past two years in changing the culture of the swimming amp diving program at uwm and improving our finishes at the league championships for the student athletes not that much changes there will be a smooth transition just the face of the program will change philosophy direction all of that is going to stay the same dave and i worked together on every decision and now that will just fall on me not both of us
8166931 i read all his books when i was a kid i read all his books

8166934 our intelligence suggests this was carried out by a cross border gang of organised criminals operating in the east midlands area and it is one of a series of very similar incidents
8166935 there is no business to be done on a dead planet

8166938 the break came at a really good time because i thought we were exhausted
8166939 like most teams in the league we had so many players come in from overseas at the start of the season and they were exhausted
8166940 didnt really go anywhere tropical or sunny just kind of kept it quiet for myself not really tried to do too much
8166941 we just have been working on defensively keeping the ball in front of us working on our schemes and then offensively just tightening up some things
8166942 i thought we started out playing good d and as the season progresses you really dont have practice time theres been some slippage we just want to get back to doing things the right way
8166943 were in a good position ending the season off so we have to come back ready to go and i think were ready to do that
8166944 things have started to pick back up and were starting to get back on track
8166945 the future of ideas the fate of the commons in a connected world
8166946 your money or your life transforming your relationship with money and achieving financial independence
8166947 i dont believe that i have even a tenth of the answers for how this might be accomplished
8166948 i never gave a shit about what hillary stood for or my fellow democrats i just wanted hillary to win the nomination so to punish the rest of you ill demonstrate my pettiness by talking shit about the democratic nominee
8166949 when the sic screwed fl and mi out of the votes for clinton
8166950 where the world started and the world will end hot glorious austin texas
8166951 its fucking hot as shit in here thanks for coming out and sweating your balls off with us
8166952 liphone 3g passera 1 8 mbits en france la mi septembre mail dorange
8166953 we would have to close our doors there is no way we could survive
8166954 i think we are forgetting the whole point of volunteering youre looking at volunteers trying to assist others making their surroundings beautiful to give back to their community trying to pay them misses the whole point of what volunteering is all about
8166955 we gave them equal opportunities and jake i wouldnt have guessed when we signed wade ended up beating him out
8166956 he came out and took the job he earned it he didnt get it by default
8166957 they didnt know they could count on me to come play
8166958 that didnt surprise me i knew after getting hurt i couldnt come in and mess around this was kind of make or break
8166959 before jake got hurt he was playing well but he wasnt the same jake that we see right now hes much stronger quicker
8166960 once my body felt good that made my mind feel good
8166961 being in the same system two years in a row is huge being able to try to fine tune something rather than try learning which way to go that makes a huge difference too
8166962 it will probably be a nice calm weekend something visitors havent seen in a decade
8166963 last year was real slow at this time and both boat ramps were unusable then
8166964 i think if we still had the water we might have had the crowds
8166965 thank you very much for the letter and the items in the box im not in the worst of places right now but the supply lines stink around here and its impossible sometimes to get anything the hygiene items will help tremenously
8166966 i am a blackhawk pilot i fly medevac missions here in iraq i have two incredible little girls one is 4 and the other 2 my wife is taking care of them right now and has the hardest job in the army keeping her sanity with them around
8166967 the life here is slow thankfully and i work with a lot of allied troops from poland mongolia and bosnia
8166968 the support from the u s is awesome and we all appreciate it more than words can say please continue with it and keep us in your prayers thank you again for everything
8166969 i am one of those people who is going to be really hurt by this cut
8166970 it takes me two and a quarter hours to get ready to go to work if its going to be cut to three hours a day what am i supposed to do the rest of the day
8166971 switching between coaches really leaves the athletes with an unknown stress its really hard to build a program without the constant of a varsity coach
8166972 every team uses different terminology when i was in high school we used position names some coaches use numbers some use plays it just depends on how the program is run i am still learning the program they use here and what has been previously taught to avoid confusion i am learning a lot this year so that next year will go a little more smoothly
8166973 i try not to know whos returning and whos not
8166974 because i dont want it to affect my decision on whether or not to keep a player on the team
8166975 callie rocks the front row when she gets a piece of the ball
8166976 shes also a great blocker and kenyah is a fabulous blocker because she can jump she is a middle hitter for me
8166977 saras a fabulous athlete and a great front row player if i ask her to do something she will keep trying until she does it correctly
8166978 alex is a great blocker and has a consistent serve
8166979 nichole is quiet with a fierce swing and she can serve well too
8166980 christy is a back row perfectionist who can dig about anything and jessy is a hard worker whos perfecting her serves
8166981 back row is tanedos specialty but when asked to play up front she will without complaint
8166982 alyssa can really place the ball where it needs to be and she can also hit
8166983 syd is a smart player who knows how to make a play and she can place her serve
8166984 kenny has been a huge help and he has helped the teams in previous years
8166985 he helps with those little important things that coaches always forget about
8166986 i have no idea how the sierra league is shaping up but i know that manogue had a good team last year and carson and south tahoe have a lot of girls who play year round so im thinking we will have some real challenges throughout the year
8166987 but our girls are tough and they are hard workers so well have to wait and see
8166988 grazs nick graziano turf toe looks like its coming around and well see what happens kap is the starter nick missed a little practice time in fall camp and that set him back a little bit he wasnt able to recover it had nothing to do with missing spring practice
8166989 i wasnt worried about it i just focused on getting better getting ready for the first game
8166990 he ault said it was still a competition every day and the job was on the line whether its the first game or middle of the season he said we could be replaced
8166991 i sort of expected it to tell you the truth because im coming back from an injury and especially not getting the reps
8166992 s programming from a to z everything you wanted to know about text but were afraid to ask prophecyboy adam simon on digital media gaming live performance and other forms of geekery resources a database of sources for physical computing parts methods software and other resources
8166993 what the caterpillar calls the end of the world the master calls a butterfly
8166994 on the morning of may 5 2007 i met with my wife shelby joanette and i shot her i shot her and im very sorry very sorry that that happened
8166995 mr auer hes a district attorney thats willing to think outside the box at times hes been a hard nosed prosecutor but hes also been a prosecutor with some compassion and i think hes a wonderful wonderful prosecutor along with his deputy mark krueger
8166996 the family desired 30 years and if everything goes right for mr newcastle in prison which hopefully it will he will do 30 years
8166997 welcome to the first presidential debate between sen barack obama and sen john mccain lets start with sen mccain
8166998 senator how will you fight the war in iraq differently
8166999 my friends i was a pow and i know how to win wars and we are going to win in iraq
8167000 because im a pow and i wont lose a war to win an election like my opponent
8167001 im a pow and i would never question your patriotism you just hate america
8167002 what we need here is change the only way to fix the mess in iraq is to change what we are doing there
8167003 ok next question goes to sen obama health care is cited as one of the top issues for americans what is your plan to curtail rising health care costs
8167004 under my plan we will change the health care system in this country so that all americans are covered thats change you can believe in
8167005 i know a little about not having access to health care i spent five and a half years as a pow with two broken arms we dont want government run health care like i got back then which is what my opponent wants
8167006 now senator you are distorting my policies again you know my plan is all about change while yours is the same old thing we got now
8167007 gentlemen please refrain from addressing each other directly let me go on to the next question sen mccain you have been described by some of your own republican colleagues as having a problem with your temper is that true
8167008 hell no who said i had a temper problem dont they know im a pow
8167009 easy senator it was just a question sen obama youve been portrayed as a big celebrity addicted to the limelight what do you think about that
8167010 just because im more popular than jesus and hundreds of thousands of germans love me doesnt make me a celebrity i have many celebrity friends scarlett johansen just e mailed me before we went on they all say im not a celebrity im for change change you can believe in
8167011 lets switch topics to the economy now sen mccain are you rich
8167012 na im just like all good americans but im a maverick and a pow
8167013 how much money do you have to make to be considered rich
8167014 quiet please back to you sen mccain how many houses do you own
8167015 im not sure ill have to check with my staff
8167016 hey you made 4 million last year so you have no room to complain mr change
8167017 please sit down and be quiet mr mayor now its your turn sen obama you have been accused of being an arugula eating elitist is that true
8167018 whats wrong with arugula its a nice change from lettuce
8167019 enough with the change stuff already at least as a pow i didnt have to listen to this dribble over and over
8167020 sen obama what about the remarks you made about americans being bitter
8167021 americans arent bitter they want change arugula now thats bitter
8167022 change the channel senator maybe try the history channel where they might be running my story of when i was a pow
8167023 did someone say ready because im ready on day one
8167024 lian li ver ffentlicht die brandneuen maxima force psus power supply units netzteile
8167025 were going to look at some things in some certain personnels to utilize him because he catches the ball so well and he is a bigger tailback but dont mistake that
8167026 michael bush isnt here to be a fullback he has a chance to be a spectacular tailback in this league and thats what hes here to play
8167027 this may sound drastic but i have put it in gods hands and now have peace knowing that this is the best way to put this disease in check
8167028 i have complete faith that with the lords blessings this surgery will eliminate the cancer from my body and ill soon be back on the road doing what i do best

8167036 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
8167037 i actually woke up this morning and had about a 3 second flash of excitement in my gut that definitely stood out
8167038 it feels like were getting to believe in ourselves as a team that we can really do something we can really make a change
8167039 if anything well be the best conditioned team out there win or lose
8167040 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8167041 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work

8167045 a new epoch in the history of virus research had started
8167046 we hope to have a deal to mlb by the end of the year
8167047 weve got a good five weeks here for me to rehab and get a good sense of how im recovering
8167048 i think dave trembley has done a great job here he has done everything he could do to change the focus and direction of this organization
8167049 i dont think he ever gets outmanaged i think he has the respect of the players he also has a passion for the game itself that as a player you really appreciate hes into it every day hes not showing up here at 5oclock
8167050 ive got to play every game to win its like i told andy when i took over whether im here one day or two days or two months you dont need to tell me how long and i wont ask ill do the best job i can every time out here
8167051 im just a big proponent of respect for the game would i do something differently if i had a long term contract what would i do differently not play to win that wouldnt be very ethical would it
8167052 we all wish it were better but you have to be a team guy and understand the big picture
8167053 what do they expect were better than we were this season has been a lot more fun than last year i want this season to be remembered for what we accomplished not for how the season could end
8167054 if you make the right decision somebody is going to be mad you make the wrong decision and somebody is really going to be mad that is going to help baseball that is going to help the umpires im glad they did it
8167055 the game is the game let the game be pure in what it is
8167056 i guess if they can move into a new yankee stadium they can have instant replay the game is evolving much to my chagrin
8167057 they better be sure that theyve got the kinks worked out
8167058 otherwise they are going to set themselves up for some embarrassing situations that could possibly occur and i dont think major league baseball at this particular point in time needs that
8167059 i find it very strange that with 30games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8167060 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8167061 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future
8167062 i dont think there is anything wrong with it if there is one call you want them to get right its a home run
8167063 thats part of the game its not always a fun part but it is part of it
8167064 starting pitching thats the name of the game if you dont have starting pitching youre behind the eight ball from the get go and that was the game tonight
8167065 there are times where youve got to tip your hat to the starting pitcher from the other team who did a tremendous job
8167066 thats what the games all about if you get good starting pitching more times than not youre going to win the ballgame
8167067 i was behind most hitters when i did throw strikes they werent very quality
8167068 i was a little bit off my pitches were getting away from me a lot and i never really got into a good groove
8167069 i didnt have an off speed pitch i just had a good fastball it didnt matter how hard you threw it theyd hit it because they knew it was coming it taught me that i needed to focus on developing my off speed pitches
8167070 i think the big moment for him last year was in the instructional league when he began throwing a slider
8167071 he was throwing a curveball and he just didnt have the right arm angle but the last game of instructional league he was throwing a nasty slider with good depth thats when we knew that was going to be the pitch for him
8167072 even some nights when i havent had my best stuff ive gotten good results the first year i didnt have a lot of confidence but every year you need to get better and better im in a good spot now
8167073 especially if i get attacked personally called a playboy a privileged person and it is inferred that i have swiss bank accounts what i do gets twists and presented as conspiratorial but i am convinced that we have done well for the citizens of both german states
8167074 i was fascinated by nosenko because in spite of the horrific things that the agency and government did to him the torture and mental deprivation in the only public speech that he ever gave at the cia he praised the united states as being the worlds best hope for humanity condemned communism and moscow and said he never regretted his defection nor held a grudge against the officials who had persecuted him

8167094 the main theme of warner was work together to solve problems
8167095 by assessing the soil structure the teams had to decide what would be the most suitable cultivations for establishing winter wheat to maximise yield and minimise the effects on the environment
8167096 you would have to do things wrong to cause erosion and some of the groups clearly did
8167097 they were also free to choose varieties to see if any preferred different cultivation techniques
8167098 however at the beginning of july we assessed root development by measuring the volume at different depths in the soil and found some interesting variation in growth between the plots
8167099 the best root distribution followed the carrier drilling which may be because the machinery used was lighter
8167100 so we took some leaf rolling scores by assessing how tightly the flag leaves were curled around mid day
8167101 again this indicated not unsurprisingly that where root distribution was best there was less leaf rolling
8167102 given the lackluster performance in the auto market during h12008 we expect rather muted 13 earnings cagr over cy08 09e although we are optimistic on the demand outlook of crdi business given the challenging profitability scenario and valuation of 22xcy08e and 20 8xcy09e we maintain a neutral view on bosch despite the fact that it holds cash and cash equivalents of rs 580 per share and is looking to consolidate its holding beyond 70 through a share buyback
8167103 eigentlich bin ich sehr gl cklich es ist schon ein gro er fortschritt dass ich hier teilnehmen kann weil nach den olympischen spielen war ich sehr entt uscht

8167116 we are essentially mimicking what happens in the body when scavenger cells remove dead and abnormal cells if the dead cells are not removed then this affects how healthy cells behave
8167117 not only will this make the production of drugs more efficient but it will also streamline research into new medicines which use cell culture
8167118 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels

8167129 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
8167130 they asked about our actions our roles about our lives everything from where i went to high school to everything i ate in china

8167133 all of us have seen in the news the frequent reports of young people killing strangers in the street killing fathers defending their property killing people with learning difficulties killing other young people who are different to them
8167134 for 41 years weve lived in a state sponsored culture of death that has killed five million children and were now surprised that some of the surviving children have turned out violent with no regard for the sanctity of life
8167135 how many children know that their mothers have had an abortion what effect will it have on them knowing that they have been deprived of a brother or sister through abortion if a society holds human life so cheaply is it any surprise that young people will also hold life cheaply and engage in violence

8167143 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
8167144 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8167145 im not in any way trying to promote my qualifications or to dissuade others of my disqualifications to serve on a mccain ticket
8167146 wont make a lick of difference to struggling american families
8167147 he does better on television for me than he did for himself
8167148 i dont have anything to tell you about senator mccains vice presidential selection process
8167149 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8167150 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8167151 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8167152 estoy aqu como ciudadana de estados unidos y como seguidora de barack obama
8167153 debemos unirnos como un solo partido enfatiz hillary clinton para decirle no de ninguna manera a john mccain
8167154 vamos a restablecer la imagen de los estados unidos vamos a traer a nuestros soldados de irak y vamos a acabar con los grandes males la pobreza el genocidio el terrorismo y el calentamiento global

8167157 in three years afghanistan has gone from 82 percent of the provinces growing poppy to approximately 60 percent of the provinces being poppy free
8167158 at this point in time i would like to ask nato and isaf to concentrate on these three very physical targets targets in the hands of either insurgents or criminal groups

8167164 why would barack obama be friends with somebody who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8167165 if you cant get excited about voting for mccain these are the kinds of ads that get them excited about voting against obama
8167166 for better or worse has most influenced events in the preceding year
8167167 all around peshawar on every side the situation is volatile because of the people coming from bajaur bara dera adam khel and the people from swat and waziristan
8167168 all of this is impacting the infrastructure in peshawar the schools the health system everything is overloaded
8167169 we had no idea it was going to happen the government didnt tell us anything and we didnt see them anywhere
8167170 we are doing what we can to support the people here
8167171 first you have to know with no fear that someday you are going to die until you know that you are useless

8167174 uhhh how come theres so much prayin to allah and not much fightin
8167175 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8167176 if you ask those former clinton voters who they want to be for barack obama or john mccain they would say barack obama overwhelmingly
8167177 were all worried because we should as a party be doing better
8167178 i am so freaking proud of her i cant stand it she is the leader of my life but she just gave me my marching orders barack won the election
8167179 there is no sense that the party has a sense of urgency
8167180 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual but its a lousy soundbite
8167181 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis
8167182 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8167183 if john mccain has his way your bills will continue to grow and your paycheck will continue to shrink
8167184 in an obama biden administration american families will finally get a new deal for a new economy a tax cut they earned healthcare they can afford a pension they can keep and a college education they deserve
8167185 the convention is about getting american voters particularly swing voters to know barack obama and become comfortable with him
8167186 what say you pizza delivery guy with an iq over 200
8167187 she was able to talk that kid back into the appropriate behavior and she did it by conveying that she understood how he was feeling
8167188 she didnt have an air of status about her someone else had to tell me she was the wife of the senator
8167189 ive never heard a negative not from politicos not from anybody
8167190 i wanted my own money my own identity my own career
8167191 it was joe the boys and the state of delaware
8167192 unlike a lot of political wives shes very low key a lot of people gravitate toward the limelight use the position for social status but shes tried to utilize that for causes
8167193 shes definitely one who will dig in and do the hard work
8167194 she called later to say how much she appreciated it but that she didnt like the spotlight
8167195 she would call and say im going to the store do you need anything she was constantly asking what she could do to help she never forgot for a minute
8167196 im going to pueblo colo this week to campaign for barack obama and im going to campaign as hard for his candidacy
8167197 it matters to angelenos who is in the white house if i have a voice to add to this debate i intend to use it
8167198 the purpose of the meeting is to talk about the significant role that villaraigosa will play in the campaign as it moves from now forward
8167199 the obama campaign wants to make sure that he plays a crucial role in the campaign they want to reassure the mayor that the obama campaign appreciates everything he is doing
8167200 i said this is the most talented field of presidential candidates in my memory i cant remember a time when so many talented democrats were in one campaign at one time and first and foremost among them were barack obama and joe biden
8167201 im personally not aware that he made a request to speak
8167202 my understanding is that he has been one of the tremendous surrogates for sen obama
8167203 we have to get as many people on the train as possible
8167204 if youre trying to cover your bases pragmatically and already have three or four latinos on the program what is antonio going to do
8167205 im not sure there was a strong feeling that antonio could be much of a help at this convention
8167206 there has been a major concern that they are not doing the kind of hard hitting investigative or educational journalism they could
8167207 that takes lots of time and reporting and lots of resources
8167208 the real question is who is going to be paying for all of this work
8167209 where is the advertising and how quickly does it move online and how quickly do the rates increase that is going to be key for all of us
8167210 we all need to learn how to unplug and recharge
8167211 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8167212 you know theres some in the party who feel that this gathering isnt tough enough against a john mccain who after all hasnt let up for a day against this party
8167213 to wake up this hall after a speech that was not only not red meat by former governor warner but more like tofu with sprouts
8167214 if he thought the democrats were hitting john mccain hard enough
8167215 we expected a lot of red meat from senator clinton tonight
8167216 amazed why they dont have more fun with the man who calls himself dick cheney
8167217 when are they going to start going after john mccain
8167218 the greatest financial crisis weve had probably since the great depression
8167219 its not surprising that george bush and john mccain will be together in the twin cities because you cant tell them apart
8167220 is there a risk that this negative tone will ultimately hurt mccains brand as a different kind of politician
8167221 hey the price of oil might begin to spike at the pump
8167222 well last night was a mellow night about love and family and teddy getting on
8167223 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics
8167224 im good at writing songs and singing what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part

8167227 the groups that are really affected by this are primarily in quebec
8167228 because the quebec artists are sent out as the pride of the province into the international market so the majority of people who are going to lose funding are here in quebec
8167229 some programs in the arts and culture area have increased in funding others have gone down

8167231 about 20 civilians were killed three days ago due to heavy fighting in piagapo town but we cant tell whether these were results of direct attacks by the rebels or collateral damage by the bombing and shelling by military forces
8167232 it is these rogue milf members who are behind burning of houses and murder of innocent civilians
8167233 theres no comprehensive plan of action this situation must be treated as a national concern of crisis proportions
8167234 there must be awareness on the part of government of the seriousness of the humanitarian and human rights situation as the number of internally displaced people are increasing day by day

8167236 am very interested to also learn how to stop my chihuahuas from running up down the stairs i have tried to walk up the stairs first blocking them on every third step or so sometimes it works other times the three little brats run past me and believe it or not these brats do not respond to treats

8167256 its part of the game its the beauty of the game i mean mistakes are made its not like anybody wants to make mistakes especially the umpire theyre doing the best they can and thats always enough the best that they can do in the end is always enough if its not enough for certain hierarchy or whatever i think thats a shame
8167257 but mainly because i think its just a slap in the face of umpires that have been around a long time and theyve done a very good job with difficult situations in all aspects so they get calls wrong once in a while weve all done things wrong once in a while i wish we could take them back its not part of the game its not part of life
8167258 i dont think we have to follow the direction of other sports
8167259 i think our game is beautiful the way it is subtle changes here and there are ok to a degree but i think theyve made quite a few changes over the last 50 years
8167260 me personally i dont like it because im also about the tradition of a game i would think that babe ruth and teddy ballgame might be rolling in their graves about stuff like this this is why people come to the games to see the human interaction you have the umpire calling the game when its his call hes doing his best
8167261 the best that they can do in the end is always enough if its not enough for certain hierarchy or whatever i think thats a shame
8167262 this is why people come to the games to see the human interaction
8167263 i think a home run should be a home run its tough to see in some of these places

8167266 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8167267 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8167268 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8167273 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8167274 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8167275 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8167276 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8167277 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8167278 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

8167295 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8167296 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life

8167324 we want to live in queenstown the sun shines in queenstown
8167325 its not a bad place to live and were all from there
8167326 wed always start with one bar and grow organically from there
8167327 its hard to say what kind of bar it would be its a pretty competitive market in queenstown and we want to make sure were pretty confident of anything we did as opposed to coming in and trying to make a splash
8167328 it could be anything to be honest were very open in the hospitality industry but i dont think a cook is going to work in the queenstown market
8167329 we havent got our eyes on anything at the moment but we will look to see if theres anything available
8167330 long term there is definitely the desire to move back to queenstown its just about not over expanding mr mcleod said
8167331 wed probably split our time initially but long term we want to be based in queenstown

8167335 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8167336 or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8167337 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8167338 i want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day
8167339 weve got to ensure that the choice we make in this election honors the sacrifices of all who came before us and will fill the lives of our children with possibility and hope
8167340 this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8167341 we believe that everyone should have an opportunity to get ahead and with success comes a responsibility to make sure others can follow
8167342 talking about the future is a way of talking about mccains age and his connection to bush without coming out and saying it
8167343 i dont think its the candidates job this time to make the case that things are not as good as they should be
8167344 people know that its to describe how things can be better
8167345 yes the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8167346 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past

8167356 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8167357 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8167358 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8167359 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8167360 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8167361 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8167362 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8167363 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

8167367 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8167368 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8167369 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8167370 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8167371 my thought is that once i get things finalized with the city attorney and with the federal government that we can have a press conference to announce the details and rationale
8167372 we feel like at this point we really dont have a lot of options and we support the mayors decision to settle the case
8167373 its finally off to the northeast but its still got a lot of moisture thats coming up out of the gulf
8167374 thats why its kind of been so muggy and theres so much rain with it
8167375 the remains of tropical storm fay have provided a good level of wind and a decent amount of wind shear
8167376 its not uncommon with the remains of a tropical system to have these small brief tornadoes
8167377 but were starting to see our potential tornadic activity dying down
8167378 the systems moved out really by the end of today theres a chance each day for some pop up afternoon and evening thunderstorms
8167379 right now its looking a lot more like our regular summertime pattern than a tropical pattern
8167380 statutes allow money or property only to be used for law enforcement purposes
8167381 the goal is to take the car or other property away from the defendant so they arent able to use it to commit more crimes
8167382 its based on the distribution of drugs and the persons involved
8167383 anything of value in close proximity to the drugs is subject to seizure
8167384 the last thing we want is for an innocent persons property to be taken when they didnt have anything to do with the criminal conduct
8167385 nothing is ultimately forfeited and handed over to law enforcement use without a judges signature
8167386 its high dollar stuff thats not normally in the budget
8167387 always talks to them to find out if they are law enforcement first
8167388 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8167389 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8167390 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8167391 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8167392 i asked her who would do something like this and for what reason
8167393 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8167394 this is the only exhibit of its type in the nation and we are thrilled that georgia college was selected to host it as part of its tour across america
8167395 it is particularly fitting that milledgeville was chosen as the city was georgias capital during the civil war the most challenging time of lincolns presidency the selection process was very highly competitive
8167396 we believe this will improve our responsiveness to the mental health needs in our state and make mental health funding more transparent
8167397 i think what it recognizes is that its better if you have agencies that are run really by experts in their fields
8167398 it has been moved to the top of all priorities
8167399 we all suffer from impostor syndrome we await an authority who will unmask the impostor we secretly believe we are it is this secret side that holds the key to our clowns
8167400 demand is off the charts home maintenance service and repair is a 40 billion business category
8167401 a previous generation could fix things for themselves now they cant do it and whats more they dont want to
8167402 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8167403 i think weve made a lot of cuts and were going into reserves more than im comfortable with
8167404 the proposed mill levy is necessary in light of this uncertain fiscal environment
8167405 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8167406 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8167407 the weather service went from nothing to a tornado warning its kind of unusual
8167408 normally theyll give you a watch when conditions are prevalent and then theyll go to a warning
8167409 the sirens mean one and only one thing and thats a tornado not for thunderstorm not for hail
8167410 in those two areas weve got a working agreement with fire stations to go out and respond to the warning by blaring their truck siren
8167411 we are confident the new rigorous course of study a focus on increasing participation and scores in advanced placement courses and increased participation in online test preparation will help ensure future success for our students
8167412 our schools are implementing a number of strategies to ensure students succeed on the sat
8167413 clearly we must continue to raise expectations for our students in mathematics reading and all areas of the curriculum
8167414 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8167415 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8167416 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8167417 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8167418 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8167419 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8167420 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8167421 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8167422 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8167423 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8167424 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8167425 i am honoured to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8167426 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8167427 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8167428 absolutely no question about it i don t think itll stop here itll keep going
8167429 who knows what she really thinks with all the missteps that have taken place this is the only thing she could do so yes im still bitter
8167430 ive never been prouder of a democrat than i was tonight
8167431 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary
8167432 zombies latest report is on the mosque that was constructed in denvers civic center park within sight of the capitol building the mainstream media dont think this is newsworthy
8167433 i first arrived in denvers civic center park expecting to see hordes of anarchists and protesters instead i was confronted with this huge mosque made of translucent fabric
8167434 this huge mosque made of translucent fabric anyone got a match

8167436 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8167437 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8167438 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8167439 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8167440 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8167441 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8167442 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8167443 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8167444 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8167445 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8167446 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8167447 who are open to doing something on the production side
8167448 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8167449 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8167450 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8167451 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8167452 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8167453 the totality of private lotto operators that existed before the promulgation of the nla act did not and could not have employed more than 3 000 people
8167454 what the courts have done is to reinforce what is contained in the nla act of 2006
8167455 it must be pointed out that with the promulgation of the national lottery act the nla is the only organisation permitted by law to operate lotto in ghana but it can among other things license interested companies to sell its lotto on its behalf
8167456 in the new state private partnership the department of national lotteries has been dissolved products that were operated by the dnl will be operated by the nla the personnel of the defunct dnl have the option to be licensed as a lotto marketing company
8167457 of the three deaths reported from overnight one person who was attacked with axe and sticks died in hospital last night
8167458 it expresses its solidarity with local churches and the religious orders involved and condemns these actions which are an affront to dignity peoples freedom and endanger peaceful civil coexistence
8167459 about 20 civilians were killed three days ago due to heavy fighting in piagapo town but we cant tell whether these were results of direct attacks by the rebels or collateral damage by the bombing and shelling by military forces
8167460 it is these rogue milf members who are behind burning of houses and murder of innocent civilians
8167461 theres no comprehensive plan of action this situation must be treated as a national concern of crisis proportions
8167462 there must be awareness on the part of government of the seriousness of the humanitarian and human rights situation as the number of internally displaced people are increasing day by day
8167463 i dont have a church that im the pastor of so in my mind im a very untraditional reverend and my pulpit just happens to be mtv which is a very different type of congregation
8167464 run your family as the coes chief officers of everything lead by example not by preaching
8167465 when they get older its not time to back out its time to push further in their life
8167466 thats the time when they need mentoring the most and they need love the most when they get older
8167467 some parents might think its time to cut the strings i think its time to get closer these are when theyre making the biggest decisions of their life
8167468 una orgullosa partidaria del candidato presidencial dem crata barack obama

8167473 someone once told me that when you have a child it opens up parts of your heart that you never knew existed and it is so true
8167474 its like you have a child and you think everything that ive done up until this point is insignificant in comparison to being a father its a beautiful beautiful thing
8167475 everyone knows i love the riddick character and im always working on it
8167476 it just takes five years to make another one because david twohy and i are so precious about it
8167477 the proper function of man is to live not to exist i shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them i shall use my time
8167478 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
8167479 absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate
8167480 mel and stephen wanted a lavish do to celebrate their relationship they agreed to allow the event to be covered by a magazine but are obliged to fulfill certain requirements one of these is a certain quota of well known faces family and close friends simply wont do
8167481 most of her friends now are american and mel keeps herself away from the showbiz scene in london and she has felt slightly pressured into inviting celebs shes not actually met but whatever happens stephen or mel will have a fantastic day
8167482 willen we de vrijheid hebben om kinderen in te schrijven wier ouders zich loyaal opstellen tegenover ons levensbeschouwelijk en pedagogisch project
8167483 het brussels onderwijs is dat niet alleen te begrijpen door de brusselaars zelf
8167484 brussel is multicultureel en veeltalig er zijn veel kansarmen kinderen dus bij wie we een inhaalbeweging moeten maken omdat ze met ongelijke kansen vertrekken maar toch moet de lat hoog blijven liggen en de achterstand moet in het lager onderwijs weggewerkt worden anders leg je een hypotheek op de toekomst van die kinderen met alle gevolgen van dien verkeerde studiekeuze watervaleffect spijbelen burn out
8167485 dat klopt niet onderwijs bieden aan alle kinderen dat is de inspiratie van ons pedagogisch project ganshoren werd gesloten omdat men door de hoge concentratie kansarmen en de leegloop niet meer in staat was het kwaliteitsonderwijs te geven dat we beogen twintig jaar geleden was het heilig hartcollege een eliteschool voor brussel en de rand daarna kwam een periode waarin de vlaamse brusselaars hun kinderen buiten brussel op school deden dat tij is inmiddels gelukkig weer gekeerd
8167486 ik denk dat als je kwaliteitsvol onderwijs in brussel wilt aanbieden je een kritische massa moet hebben van kinderen die ingebed zitten in een nederlandstalige omgeving om als leerkracht in een volledig anderstalige school met kinderen dus die alleen in de klas nederlands horen de eindtermen van het nederlandstalig onderwijs te halen dat is echt niet simpel
8167487 onze terughoudendheid had te maken met de grondwettelijke vrijheid van onderwijs men is in dit land vrij in de manier waarop men een school opricht inricht en er inhoud aan geeft omdat de overheid subsidieert mag ze natuurlijk voorwaarden opleggen maar altijd met respect voor die vrijheid voor de inhoud hebben we een evenwicht gevonden de overheid legt de minimale kennis op die overgedragen moet worden dat zijn de eindtermen maar de manier waar p men die kennis overbrengt en wat men nog meer meegeeft zijn vrij
8167488 toen het gok decreet uitgewerkt werd waren wij bezorgd ja we wilden toch nog altijd die kinderen kunnen inschrijven van wie de ouders zich loyaal opstellen tegenover ons project en dat is een levensbeschouwelijk ge nspireerd pedagogisch project dat is ons recht en onze bestaansreden als de overheid ons verplicht iedereen in te schrijven zonder dat we van de ouders mogen vragen dat ze zich achter onze visie scharen zijn we die vrijheid kwijt het is spijtig dat men onze reserve meteen ge nterpreteerd heeft als elitarisme
8167489 klopt maar dat heeft ook te maken met het gegeven dat het vrij onderwijs altijd duurder is geweest vlaams minister van onderwijs frank vandenbroucke heeft pas onlangs de lat van de werkingsmiddelen gelijk gelegd en dan is er nog het sociologische gegeven dat je je als ouder verbonden voelt met de school van je kinderen je kunt dit negatief duiden en zeggen dat ouders hun kinderen inschrijven in scholen waar het ons kent ons is en dat ze mikken op een concentratie van de gegoede klasse maar ikzelf heb ook wel graag een school waarmee ik me verwant voel de school waarop ik vroeger heb gezeten of waar de kinderen van mijn vrienden zitten en waar ik denk me te kunnen engageren is dat verkeerd
8167490 neen dat kan heel goed vele moslimouders zeggen dat ze voor het katholiek onderwijs kiezen omdat religie niet aanwezig is in het pedagogisch project van het officieel onderwijs onze inspiratie komt uit het evangelie en uit zich in vieringen maar ook in de leerplannen neem nu de lessen gezondheidsopvoeding wij gaan ervan uit dat we ons lichaam gekregen hebben en er dus geen zelfbeschikkingsrecht over hebben ouders moeten aanvaarden dat hun kinderen die boodschap bij ons meekrijgen sommige mensen zouden wel willen dat hun kinderen niet geconfronteerd worden met onze levensbeschouwelijke visie dat ze bijvoorbeeld weg mogen blijven van de vieringen maar als we dat accepteren dan staat over vijf jaar wellicht nergens op onze scholen nog een kerststal maar natuurlijk staan we open voor dialoog en geven we de kinderen ook de antwoorden van andere levensbeschouwingen op grote vragen
8167491 het heeft zeker een gunstig effect gehad vroeger waren er in alle netten scholen die zich afschermden voor bepaalde doelgroepen de verdienste van het gok decreet is dat de scholen er zich bewust van zijn geworden dat ze moeten openstaan voor iedereen alleen blijkt dat het gekozen instrument het eerst komt eerst maalt principe zijn doel niet bereikt zwarte scholen zijn zwarter geworden witte witter en er gebeurt te weinig onderzoek naar waarom het open inschrijvingsbeleid geen socia le mix oplevert ongetwijfeld heeft het ermee te maken dat minder kwetsbare ouders mobieler en beter ge nformeerd zijn en dat ze vlugger zullen kiezen voor een school waarmee ze zich verbonden voelen
8167492 ik ben geen pedagoog en spreek me dus niet uit over percentages ik zeg alleen dat er een kritische massa moet zijn en dat nederlandstalige ouders uitzicht moeten hebben op inschrijving van hun kind in een nederlandstalige school van hun keuze die twee elementen zijn nodig om als nederlandstalige school te kunnen functioneren
8167493 ik vind het ook belangrijk dat een school goed is ingebed in de lokale gemeenschap ik denk dat h t probleem van de grootsteden de teloorgang van het sociale weefsel is een voorrang voor buurtkinderen moet wel in alle redelijkheid gebeuren het resultaat mag niet zijn dat de overheid bepaalt wie in de school mag zitten
8167494 ik denk dat de brusselse schoolbesturen van alle netten rond de tafel moeten gaan zitten en een masterplan voor brussel uitwerken daarin moeten het bestaande aanbod de spreiding over brussel en de knelpunten gedefinieerd worden vervolgens moet gekeken worden hoe men die knelpunten kan oplossen
8167495 ik denk dat vlaanderen en brussel samen over de brug moeten komen
8167496 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8167497 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8167498 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8167499 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8167500 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8167501 running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to find the money to mount an offer
8167502 if we focus only on television ads we would be dead
8167503 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8167504 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8167505 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8167506 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed it further inflames an already tense situation in the region
8167507 direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity
8167508 it is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these u n provisions express their will to have an independent existence any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not
8167509 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order
8167510 should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussions among the parties
8167511 to this end the group is engaged in constructive dialogue and is not aware of any issues which would prevent thise amendments being finalised by the end of this year
8167512 while conditions are likely to remain tough in both the uk and the us in the short term we are maintaining momentum in the uk and we have seen pockets of stabilisation in the us
8167513 rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive
8167514 the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at lower and more economical speeds
8167515 in our economic circumstances the business community will need a business paper that gives accurate business information facts figures unbiased analysis and realistic conclusions to help them predict business trends accurately
8167516 i am proud to say as the finance minister that from gh 300 000 in 2004 the company has progressively increased its profitability such that it was able to pay gh 800 000 as dividend to the state for 2007 financial year
8167517 christians moslems politicians and many other ghanaians believe in the spiritual as a result it would not be out of place if such courts are established to handle spiritual cases
8167518 when somebody uses cutlass to butcher his neighbour he is handed to the police to face the law and this has helped reduce the otherwise astronomical crime rate in society however when somebody confesses that he or she killed or destroyed the lives of people thought to be wizards they are allowed to go scott free
8167519 i believed that witches and all those who use satanic forces to kill human beings should be made to suffer or be punished with imprisonment to serve as a deterrent to others who would want to destroy innocent people he continued that there are so many people whose lives have been destroyed by fellow beings through the use of satanic powers but nothing is done to them for them to suffer for their evil deeds if spiritual courts are established reckless killings and the use of satanic powers would certainly be overcome in our society
8167520 if people are made to be accountable so much of the wickedness in society would vanish
8167521 when i was young you had to climb a coconut tree to see the sea
8167522 every year the sea comes closer we keep moving the village and we are being pushed down to the lagoon
8167523 the project aims to harvest 14 million cubic metres 494 4 million cu ft of timber worth about 4 billion
8167524 there are very similar circumstances in numerous countries around the world including ivory coast cameroon brazil surinam malaysia and others
8167525 the potential is there they are awaiting to see the outcome of the ghana project
8167526 5 million hectares 12 36 million acres of salvageable submerged timber in the hydroelectric reservoirs in the tropics with the potential to supplement global demand for timber
8167527 boat collisions with submerged tree stumps cause many fatalities every year
8167528 maybe at the time we thought we had enough timber in our forest estates to sustain us now because of the decline we need to diversify
8167529 it makes sense to address all gases that lead to climate change
8167530 the more gases you cover the greater flexibility countries have
8167531 very little is known about sources current and future emissions and atmospheric abundance of these gases
8167532 emissions in 1990 are assumed to have been close to zero but are increasing exponentially
8167533 in principle increase the demand for tradable units under the kyoto protocol
8167534 we receive motivation from our bosses and that we deliver what we have been taught
8167535 it allows the growers to visualize the observed variability of the vine at the level of the vineyard said bruno tisseyre a lecturer at the institute for agronomic research
8167536 for the co operative caves who buy the grapes they can know the potential quality and quantity of wine very early six weeks before the harvest

8167538 it has been recognized as innovative and is intended to be used in the rest of france and the world
8167539 the ndcc and all lgus must proactively plan for fresh and larger influx of internally displaced persons

8167544 i dont have a church that im the pastor of so in my mind im a very untraditional reverend and my pulpit just happens to be mtv which is a very different type of congregation

8167565 i just signed my budget message last sunday night it addresses the world food and fuel crises without forgetting the economy environment and education

8167623 eight weeks ago senator barack obama was on top in all three of these key swing states and that would make his election almost a sure thing times have changed and the election is now very much a toss up in these states senator obama needs this convention to give his campaign a jump start

8167634 this is good news and is entirely attributable to the availability of government programs like medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip
8167635 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the healthcare they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8167636 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of the state childrens health insurance program over president bushs two vetoes
8167637 an opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together
8167638 so a lot of businesses across the country are feeling they cannot sustain the healthcare coverage they used to provide for their workers or they are requiring workers to pay more in premiums and deductibles and as a result many of the workers can no longer afford coverage
8167639 and more people are priced out of the healthcare they used to take for granted
8167640 both the technology vendors as well as internal it departments are challenged with aligning the technology with the business and meeting the deployment and change management needs of the enterprise with hr technology

8167645 umpires make mistakes you dont want one of those plays to ruin the outcome of your game
8167646 if they review that theres a high chance we win the series
8167647 i like the human decision of the umpires whether its right or wrong thats what makes baseball guy might be safe and called out all the fans get upset and scream everyone jumping up and down thats kind of cool
8167648 i love the sport the way it is but the configuration of new and old ballparks is more difficult than it once was on umpires

8167656 you think back to how your parents struggled just so you could have certain things
8167657 we used him as a good example of what can happen if you just stay with it and work hard
8167658 weve fallen into this false sense of urgency that they create
8167659 that idea that everything is breaking news and that if youre not watching us youre going to miss this thing
8167660 but nothing theyre saying is of any import because nobody filters it
8167661 its showing an expertise its the whole reason you guys are in the business youre not on anyones team youre on our team and thats whats stopped
8167662 nobody wanted to have a beer with him he would have been a terrible president hes an elitist can he bowl somebody could have bowled him i just find it stunning as to where this election is going to be decided or where we allow it to be decided

8167687 you would have to be deaf dumb and blind not to have the feeling of party unity after the speech hillary clinton gave
8167688 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8167689 she understands that the unity of this party is tantamount to our success
8167690 as a hillary clinton delegate i will listen to her and i will support barack obama
8167691 i think unity is possible i came to the convention thinking it might not be
8167692 i was kind of cautious about buying into it afraid that a lot of people werent going to buy into it that the convention was going to fall apart
8167693 not everyone can get over hillary but people are moving on
8167694 i think when they heard hillary tonight they will go with obama
8167695 she told us we have to stand behind obama to recover our nation
8167696 both are committed to the democratic platform we are safe with barack obama we are not safe with john mccain
8167697 i wont vote for mccain but obama has to get me here and i havent connected with him
8167698 i cant believe anyone could do such a thing we are devastated and desperate to find out who is responsible we wont rest until we do

8167722 while the s amp p asx 300 index has dropped by more than 14 per cent during this period the macmahon share price has actually improved by nearly 2 per cent
8167723 macmahon has been a clear equity market outperformer despite the criticism that has been levelled at macmahon shares by ausdrills board since we first announced the takeover offer
8167724 we are pleased with our strong financial results and the markets recognition of this in our share price
8167725 our share price strength has also underpinned the value of ausdrills shares during the market weakness
8167726 based on the closing price of macmahon shares on 26 august of 1 82 and the ratio of 1 65 our offer implies an ausdrill price of 3 00 which is a 54 per cent premium over ausdrills pre bid price of 1 95

8167770 it has been clear from public meetings and comments throughout the press that crofters have real concerns about some key aspects of the shucksmith report
8167771 there is real doubt about the workability and acceptability of the proposed real burdens on crofts
8167772 crofters are also clearly concerned about local boards taking regulatory decisions and when faced with the choice overwhelmingly prefer the crofters commission performing that role
8167773 the government need to listen to crofters views on these key issues
8167774 the shucksmith recommendations on reforming agricultural payments to favour crofters to improve housing grant and loans and for keeping the register of crofts for example all seem to be sensible and workable and would advance the interests of crofting
8167775 the government should get on with backing crofting and implement these recommendations quickly as none of them require legislation
8167776 this survey is very helpful in cataloguing the concerns crofters have
8167777 it was only half way through consideration of the last crofting bill in parliament that the full concerns of crofters about key clauses became abundantly clear
8167778 parliament was not prepared to force through legislation about crofting where there was such uncertainty within the crofting community about key issues
8167779 that is why we recommended the then government drop some parts of the bill and consult crofters on their future
8167780 given parliaments desire to listen to crofters views and to seek a broad consensus on the way forward for crofting the government would be foolish to try and push through provisions which clearly do not have the support of the vast bulk of crofters
8167781 it remains the case that some of the more controversial recommendations in the shucksmith report were designed to address the questions arising from the developing free market in crofts which is real and also causing widespread concern in the crofting community
8167782 if the particular prescription shucksmith offered is seen to be unworkable there is a need to develop alternative proposals
8167783 i do not believe that to be impossible and in part the answer will relate to the way in which the commission is appointed directed to operate and what its priorities should be
8167784 the commission is supported by a body of law which is extensive and can have real impacts if used consistently and effectively
8167785 my colleagues and i will be considering the issues here and so that we can play a full part in ensuring the challenges facing crofting are met and its future secured but doing so in a way that seeks to work with the crofting communities and gains their active support for improvement measures

8167851 selain itu taste yang ditawarkan mizone juga cukup friendly bagi pelanggan cukup berbeda dengan taste yang dimiliki minuman isotonik lainnya
8167852 ini untuk membuktikan bahwa mizone adalah brand yang tetap hidup aktif dan inovatif
8167853 jadi sebenarnya bukan kesalahan mizone tapi merupakan faktor makro dari industri dan pasar yang memang di luar kendali brand yang bersangkutan yang pada akhirnya dapat memengaruhi image merek yang sedang diisukan
8167854 memang seharusnya isu tersebut tidak terus dilawan karena akan semakin berkembang
8167855 awalnya sempat ragu juga untuk minum mizone lagi tapi ternyata memang tidak ada masalah dengan produknya

8167871 there is a perception that it is sometimes easier for motorcyclists to evade detection of offences because of the speed they travel at
8167872 we are seeing accidents in essex dramatically reduced as a result of our intervention and education campaign but need to make more impact on motorcycle accidents
8167873 there is a perception it is sometimes easier for motorcyclists to evade detection of offences because of the speed they travel at
8167874 we feel signs warning of the likelihood of detection by air will be an extra incentive for motorcyclists in particular and all motorists to drive safely
8167875 possibly not the best way to encourage drivers to keep their eyes on the road
8167876 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going
8167877 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point

8167889 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8167890 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for all the people in this country that feel invisible
8167891 im here tonight as a proud mother a proud democrat a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8167892 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8167893 and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8167894 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8167895 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8167896 i havent spent the last 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal healthcare helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfils the hopes of our people
8167897 but it will be impossible if we dont fight to put a democrat back into the white house
8167898 he built his campaign on the fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up not the top down and he knows that government must be about we the people not we the favoured few
8167899 and when barack obamas in the white house hell revitalise our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8167900 as i recall we did it before with president clinton and the democrats
8167901 and if we do our part well do it again with president obama
8167902 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8167903 he has served our country with honour and courage but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8167904 well john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatise social security and in 2008 he still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8167905 now with an agenda like that it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8167906 a strong leader a good man who understands both the economic stresses here at home and the strategic challenges abroad
8167907 its so important for children to have a space of their own to create in

8167915 opvallend is dat de hulpverlening in spanje en griekenland is toegenomen terwijl er minder mensen naar turkije gaan

8167921 we are clear you can only have certainty about a fixed election date in the context of a majority government
8167922 if any of the opposition parties wanted to provide some any degree of certainty that well be here in october 2009 then well have an election in october 2009
8167923 i wonder if you can get specific about where this dysfunction lies my understanding is that there were 43 confidence votes in the last parliamentary session and you survived every one
8167924 were just here to make sure everyone has a chance to be heard everyone has the right to speak their minds whether we agree with them or not and were going to do our best to make sure that they get that chance
8167925 but there are some folks down here right now who dont really play that way
8167926 true some of the anarchists and such but its been pretty quiet and hopefully it will stay that way a good night to me would be a boring night
8167927 a vote for mccain doesnt just hurt women it hurts

8167930 there is scarcely an event in modern history that cannot be traced to the jews take the great war world war i the jews have made this war we jews who have posed as the saviours of the world we jews today are nothing else but the worlds seducers its destroyers its incendiaries its executioners we have finally succeeded in landing you into a new hell
8167931 full responsibility for the first world war lies squarely on the shoulders of the international jewish bankers they are responsible for millions of dead and dying
8167932 the bolshevik revolution in russia was the work of jewish planning and jewish dissatisfaction
8167933 by using the new atheist exile politics they the zionists provoked and increased anti semitism in europe which led to the second world war the worldwide boycott against germany in 1933 and the later all out declaration of war against germany initiated by the zionist leaders and the world jewish congress
8167934 world war ii was a zionist plot to make way for the foundation of the jewish state in palestine
8167935 the bolshevik revolution in russia was the work of jewish planning and jewish dissatisfaction our plan is to have a new world order what worked so wonderfully in russia is going to become reality for the whole world
8167936 by using the new atheist exile politics they the zionists provoked and increased anti semitism in europe which led to the second world war
8167937 weve been fighting a war for the past 18 months which is the harbinger of world war iii the world is going to fight whether they like it or not im sure
8167938 sept 11 was a watershed event and things will never be the same the battle lines have been drawn
8167939 the israeli government pays them back the collateral is the eternity of the jewish people
8167940 we believe the state of israel will continue to exist forever therefore its a sure investment
8167941 its a clash between the forces of evil as president bush so neatly described it and forces of life

8167947 use it or lose it is the first principle of sovereignty in the arctic
8167948 what georgia shows is that uncertain boundaries and oil and gas and russians are a volatile mix
8167949 if nothing else this should be a wake up call for us and we should not expect this to be a cakewalk with the russians they are very aggressive in pursuing what they believe are their interests
8167950 you need to actually have boots on the ground and boats in the water you need to have surveillance
8167951 america was methodist once upon a time methodist or baptist or presbyterian or congregationalist or episcopalian
8167952 would have trouble recalling the dogmas that once defined all the jarring sects but their names remain at least half alive
8167953 the death of protestant america a political theory of the protestant mainline
8167954 early in the morning our song shall rise to thee
8167955 they asked her to stay because of the current political uncertainty
8167956 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8167957 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8167958 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks
8167959 i think the fact that it seems to be taking several weeks just to have a phone call with opposition leaders i think indicates frankly a much deeper issue and that is that this parliament is increasingly reaching an impasse on a range of issues
8167960 today is an additional episode of a continuing saga of a fabricated emergency by the prime minister
8167961 he wants to meet me and to pretend that the meeting went so badly that he needs to call an election thats what its all about
8167962 now hes saying i want to meet the leaders of the opposition i want them to accept my agenda what is his agenda nobody has any idea of what is his agenda maybe not himself and you want me to agree with it on the phone this is a joke
8167963 albertas economy continues to do well despite a general slowdown in global economic activity
8167964 i think its clear that alberta is still leading the nation
8167965 we should be having 13 billion in savings this year not 2 5 billion in maybe savings
8167966 we may have a savings opportunity here that we may not have five years from now
8167967 when we look forward in the future and say i want to stay this prosperous forever i think the chances of that are pretty slim
8167968 he sought to counsel and calm the despairing to transform the grief that contemplates the grave by showing it the grief that looks up to the stars

8167972 i have used painkillers and stuff but i cannot go on like this
8167973 i need to have the problem corrected and as such i will be going across to new york to have surgery done on the ankle i have pushed it to the limit and there is no way i could have continued with the problem persisting
8167974 the match in vadodara will feature all the probables for the test series against australia
8167975 there are no plans to take part in any international event during that period
8167976 we would like to use that time to get our best players to play in domestic cricket and prepare in the best manner possible for the very important series against australia what we are also planning at this stage is to organise a comprehensive camp for our players ahead of that series
8167977 we are also keen to have the mohammad nissar trophy on september 15 in delhi between the domestic champions of india and pakistan too there is also the important series two tests between india a and australia a starting in bangalore on september 3 we would like to focus on these events and i dont think anything else is possible
8167978 pakistan sri lanka and south africa have confirmed for a quadrangular one day tournament in south africa while india australia or new zealand will most likely be filling in the final spot
8167979 what causes fights and quarrels among you dont they come from the desires that battle within you you want something but you do not get it you kill and covet but you cannot have what you want
8167980 i insist on you agreeing with me i insist that my point of view is right i know the correct way to do things and you must do them my way
8167981 thats what weve been hearing so far but we havent absolutely confirmed that yet

8167983 some of the spruce trees are over 30 feet tall its ripped them right out of the ground
8167984 it picked up a full 45 gallon water barrel and tossed it across the yard like it was empty
8167985 i find that hard to believe but im not discounting anything ill wait for my investigators to provide some preliminary findings to me
8167986 i do want to know immediately if there is a security concern regarding infrastructure
8167987 inmates are pretty ingenious and they do have a lot of time on their hands i understand that we have to look at every possible scenario
8167988 staff will be very critical in this to provide us with some feedback into what happened that night
8167989 its hard to say watch what you buy because you think when youre buying food its good to eat its not going to do this to you so its hard tell people what to do
8167990 i started with having migraines and cramps for about a few weeks then i started getting really bad migraines and cramping and throwing up
8167991 we were told she had listeria when she was in the hospital the doctors told us that
8167992 ive been in constant contact with the health people in alberta in fact i was the one who alerted them to her death because i kept hearing on the news that there were x numbers in ontario and there were some in b c and some in saskatchewan but they were saying there were none in alberta
8167993 we were told she had listeria when she was in the hospital the doctors told us that
8167994 its frustrating because were waiting for a little bit of closure in my daughters death
8167995 she said im mending and i should be out in two days and suddenly she developed a very very high fever and they had to pack her in ice overnight
8167996 non sono venuto a sapere niente pi di quanto gi non sapessi e che hai saputo niente
8167997 sony should just have a custom developers package for homebrew
8167998 they said they were trying to speed up the game and this isnt going to help
8167999 but nowadays everything going on with the game and life is about change
8168000 so it might be good it might be bad i guess its worth a try
8168001 it may be something that is completely horrible or completely helps us out a lot
8168002 were the only major sport that doesnt have it i dont see it being too bad
8168003 im just a fan of the game and the way its been played for 100 plus years
8168004 im also afraid youre going to open pandoras box and replay may leak into safe out and ball strike calls and thats the worst thing that could happen to the game
8168005 im trying to have an open mind and say you cant stop technology and anything that helps me do a better job im for it
8168006 instant replay has been our the umpires friend not our enemy showing that we have great skill at what were doing but the calls were talking about reviewing are game changing calls
8168007 so were going to use what technology has brought us to try to do a better job were not fighting it because anything that helps me to do a better job im for it im sure there are things out there that we havent thought of that well still have to face to make this even better
8168008 we go right into a tough opponent away a five hour trip theres a lot of challenges for us and itll be a unique situation to find out where were at as a football team in terms of maturity and how we handle things
8168009 i think itll have a lot to do with giving us experience to go into different environments throughout the year
8168010 we still have to come back and play eastern michigan and go on through the schedule but it proves that we can play away from home if we come out of there a winner it proves we can go into a tough environment and play against a very good football team so i think its a test to see if we can handle an adverse environment
8168011 going into camp we knew it wouldnt be an easy first game
8168012 we tried to prepare like this was a bowl game
8168013 i think their offensive line is very good and they have an outstanding tailback that played some last year in jahvid best
8168014 theyre very well coached they have a highly ranked linebacker group the defensive line is solid i guess the strength would be their offensive line their center is outstanding but theyre retooling as well
8168015 it is impossible for this maple bat to shatter in the way the maple bats shatter in the major leagues today
8168016 you will never have a barrel separating from the handle
8168017 there were 150 people who were lining the shores watching this guy jump off my dock

8168024 i only hope their batons dont test positive for pine tar
8168025 in that game everybodys going to bring their a game anyway i dont imagine we can get their guys to play any harder than they already would have
8168026 i guess i made a mistake in cutting a joke
8168027 julio you know what i actually ran into julio in the spring recruiting
8168028 i said hello to him and said i guess ill be seeing you at the end of august then he got out and got in his escalade and drove off thats serious
8168029 and then i went over and watched alabama freshman burton scott at vigor high school at the track over there and burton scott was running around he went and got in his escalade out at track practice and drove off so im familiar with those two guys
8168030 it was my misjudgement in saying something in a joking manner that got taken and run with
8168031 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8168032 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8168033 when a guy makes his first start you want to play a clean game
8168034 when a guy is having the kind of year hes having and you give him that cushion youre normally in for a long night
8168035 we didnt hit good enough we didnt play good enough defense and we didnt pitch good enough or manage good enough its my responsibility for the performance and the performance hasnt been very good all year very disappointing and surprising
8168036 that goes along with winning as many games as you can that old stuff about if you dont finish first it doesnt matter where you finish i dont buy that at all
8168037 my ball was flat and not down in the zone
8168038 were playing everything by ear well sit down with a big sigh of relief whenever and however its completed
8168039 these folks get to be mourned get to be remembered and get to be honored
8168040 theres no doubt we have a real sense of history and depth
8168041 whats been really satisfying is so many people believe in this project they will push it through

8168067 the situation with robbie is still up in the air so he wont be involved against grimsby
8168068 these things do take time especially when the agent gets involved
8168069 im not unsure about robbie im just unsure as to when it will get done
8168070 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8168071 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8168072 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8168073 its not only the weather that im not happy about here in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life

8168081 the most useful lessons to be learned in the fight against global warming can probably be gleaned from grade school problem solving exercises for example that letting air out of the tires of a truck that doesnt quite fit under a bridge is easier than raising the bridge in other words difficult problems dont always call for complicated solutions
8168082 hes had a rocky relationship with the partys conservative base
8168083 the republican party is the next guy in line party whoever he picks as vice president could become the next guy in line if he picks a mainstream conservative then the conservatives can get excited not just about the mccain candidacy but the future of the party
8168084 a week ago romney and pawlenty looked like the two most likely conservative choices but i think over the last several days events have conspired against both of them
8168085 i think his aides floated the idea of lieberman to prove to mccain that it would get knocked down

8168095 we couldnt get any breaks we hit some balls hard at people but we couldnt get his pitch count up because he was throwing so many strikes

8168110 for the long term and for the good of the program this is in our best interest

8168116 it gives you a belief that when you find yourself in those certain important moments when you just need to come up with something good and something special and just try to be calm and hold your nerves
8168117 thats what happens when you have experience with winning grand slams thats why roger and rafa are so dominant and they look so good on the court when they have important moments

8168126 het schooluniform is er al zo lang als de school bestaat sinds het einde van de jaren vijftig
8168127 enkele jaren geleden hebben we in overleg met leerlingen en ouders besloten om het uniform te behouden
8168128 er is geen rivaliteit onder de leerlingen omwille van de kledij
8168129 zo wordt er geen onderscheid gemaakt tussen rang of stand
8168130 over de kleur groen is er wel eens discussie met de meisjes
8168131 er is een engelse school waar ongeveer hetzelfde uniform gedragen wordt
8168132 omdat ze in de zomer een lange broek moeten dragen nee dan maak ik geen uitzondering
8168133 this has been an excellent first half for the group with improved copper production and prices resulting in increased earnings
8168134 our operations have performed well and despite substantial continuing industry wide cost pressures including fuel energy and acid production levels and costs across the group remain in line with forecast
8168135 with our sound financial position we continue to make good progress with the groups plans for sustainable growth through both brownfield and greenfield projects as well as exploration in chile and internationally and this should result in further profitable volume growth from 2010 and beyond
8168136 with continued strong demand for our services and a positive outlook for new project awards we are confident that the group is well positioned to deliver 2008 results towards the top end of market expectations and strong growth over the medium term
8168137 the terms of the financing available did not enable a sufficiently compelling alternative cash offer to be made for tns
8168138 based on the closing price of 506 5p per wpp share as at 26 august 2008 the wpp offer values each tns share at 268 7p this price undervalues tns

8168191 its a war for identity i am a kashmiri muslim and my dress and look have got nothing to do with what i am shouting for
8168192 this is the generation that was born in the bloody 1990s and grew up in the machiavellian 2000s they have lived and outsmarted violence they enjoy the consumerist goodies but have an anger latent in their hearts and minds
8168193 this generation symbolises the future of kashmir and is politically more aware than their previous generations
8168194 we no longer trust any leaders not even the mirwaizs and the geelanis chairmen of their respective factions of the separatist hurriyat conference not to talk of the abdullahs and the muftis mainstream politicians of the world
8168195 i wish someone was in the driving seat to channel and steer our energy and enthusiasm but all politicians are busy in petty politics
8168196 the uprising we see now is the hidden anger it typifies the failure of efforts by india to win the hearts and minds of muslim kashmiris
8168197 kashmiri public opinion is hardly largely pro pakistan or anti india its distrust that runs deep todays youths have seen it all they are not radicalised islamists as india or its rightwing parties would like to believe
8168198 they are not indifferent to realities they know the failures and successes of both countries but the current conundrum in kashmir is a result of the mistakes of previous generations they have left the dispute unsettled
8168199 not only does the arts and cultural industry make a valuable economic contribution in its own right it also stimulates creative activity in other sectors of the economy
8168200 countries around the world as well as many cities and regions recognise that a dynamic culture sector plays a key role as a magnet for talent enhances economic output and acts as a catalyst for prosperity
8168201 opportunities for growth in the culture sector are being driven by digital technologies and exploding use of the internet these technologies allow content producers to distribute their works to a wide audience and consumers to participate directly in creating cultural content
8168202 even using the most optimistic forecasts for levels of domestic graduates and of migration into australia it skills shortages will continue or get worse at least until 2012
8168203 this is a worrying trend considering the strategic importance of it sector to the australian economy according to 2006 data from the australian bureau of statistics it is one of the main contributors to productivity gains in all sectors of the australian economy
8168204 it is also economically more significant than agriculture defence education and mining with over five percent of australias full time professionals and technicians employed in ict

8168208 this is far from being a reasonable therapeutic intervention for hbp but these findings indicate a first step in understanding the pathway of the disease
8168209 you cannot prevent a disease until you know the cause this study is a way of finding that out
8168210 our calls for national unity good governance and a vibrant democracy have silenced the voices of racist chanting those who profit from the abuse of power and exploit the politics of fear and deceit

8168216 kvk chomu has proved a boon for the areas vegetable and fruit growers you find a host of inquisitive visitors to the centre every day
8168217 since cultivation is our mainstay we need to learn how to increase output it has become more important in view of increasing input costs
8168218 we have a year long training programme for young farmers we enrol 25 applicants in each batch and make them undergo a total training programme
8168219 farmers from around 100 villages are being covered by the kvk and they grow vegetables in an area of over 1 000 hectares
8168220 it has been only a year since i opted for drip irrigation but i can feel the difference already my yield has gone up

8168229 teaching cluster courses requires a certain amount of coordination among all the faculty
8168230 its a little bit harder to teach than a typical course where the instructor has total control because each of the courses must be related to one another
8168231 our role is to talk with students later on because as freshmen and sophomores they should be focused on their perspective and connections requirements
8168232 and if you look at the courses they are all upper level and may require a bit of background
8168233 candidates in the past have shown that we can have large meetings like this if weve contacted campaign workers on a one to one basis
8168234 he was a nave kid who wouldnt hurt a fly
8168235 we know he was very wrong and we are grateful that nobody was seriously injured
8168236 my parents need their little boy and i need him too
8168237 theres an involuntary clench in my back every time i see a car go by
8168238 i feel less anxious but nothing will ever be the same
8168239 we believe his intent was to kill as many americans as were on uncs campus that day
8168240 i dont in any way minimize what happened at unc but the fact of the matter is that this is not a situation where anyone was killed
8168241 one of the things our government wont tolerate is folks trying to use american citizens as punching bags
8168242 if youre anything like the rest of us there will come a point in your life when you truly regret renting that car
8168243 it was sparked by our desire to protect students not just from a security standpoint but from the consequences
8168244 i dont think posters alone will keep people from doing it
8168245 unauthorized copying distributing altering or translating of copyrighted materials software music or other media
8168246 for the casual downloader such notices might make a difference but those intent on downloading their whole libraries the advertising campaign wont stop them
8168247 were going to have to take a much more active role in persuading folks to come to carolina
8168248 weve been saying those same things for a long time and we need to come up with some other ideas
8168249 there are a lot of folks that have become managers who dont have any training in how to be a manager
8168250 one good thing about having a chancellor whos from here is that sometimes i can challenge some of these sacred things
8168251 if theres more we can do i will be the most willing to bring things like that up
8168252 its hard for me to imagine a way we can discourage bars but i can imagine that if we own 12 acres on franklin street that we will be able to encourage other vendors
8168253 id still rather be here over any of those other places
8168254 i was accepted to princeton and harvard and i still chose here
8168255 its more fun here and more of a community its so much easier to get involved i love it here
8168256 the computer models are all over the place right now
8168257 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8168258 the economic health of galveston is pretty sturdy but we have a sense that people are more pinched by the cost of food and fuel
8168259 we want people to recognize what it has done in the past to touch the community
8168260 were convinced people will see these good things happening around them and be willing to come back this year to support the campaign

8168263 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8168264 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8168265 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8168266 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8168267 i cant walk out to the bird feeder without having my legs completely covered with them
8168268 i was talking to my sister districts and theyre all scrambling too trying to catch up with these things hopefully by the weekend it will be better i wont say theyll be gone but hopefully theyll be better
8168269 he said it was a story the nation should know im a representative for millions of people in this country that are in the same situation i am
8168270 we may not have been rich but we had a good living
8168271 i know the kinds of things he did as a younger man he didnt go for the big fancy jobs
8168272 i just feel like he understands the working people better
8168273 i had to deal with things the last eight years under bush mccains going to be the same thing
8168274 obamas offering the opportunity for change we wont know that it can happen unless we give him the chance
8168275 he didnt act like he was better than i was
8168276 there was absolutely nothing about it that signaled danger to anyone
8168277 im definitely 100 percent more cautious and aware of my surroundings
8168278 obviously if you see a car on campus now people are going to immediately associate it with the pit attacks
8168279 while we were grieving with the whole campus community at the same time there was an additional level of nervousness and fear because we were afraid that people would take it out on us
8168280 i think about what other people think when they see me
8168281 im sure people are thinking about it they remember stuff just as much as theyll remember not to walk by themselves at night but its not like were walking through the pit looking for cars
8168282 this years sat results are relatively unchanged tracking the national trend
8168283 our students continue to perform very well on this assessment that is taken by almost all of our students
8168284 theres so much talent in this area so many good bands but the traditional music industry is a bloodbath right now
8168285 there are so many bands here who dont tour and maybe theyre scared but its no fault of their own its a scary thing hopefully things like this will give them some direction by talking to people on the other side of things
8168286 we have a huge number of people in the music industry outside of just musicians
8168287 weve got a tremendous amount of information and resources in the area for music
8168288 though the best way to meet other musicians is to attend local shows this event will provide an environment better suited for discussion and networking than a show
8168289 its a way to become involved with the music community on the level of planning rather than experiencing
8168290 being in a band and trying to book sometimes its a bit of an enigma wandering in and not being sure what information is pertinent
8168291 the things i might think are important and interesting venue owners might care less about
8168292 as far as getting to know other bands and getting to know people who are doing that the sharing of information is so valuable
8168293 everybody there will have had some experience in the topic or at least they can lead you to somebody who does
8168294 the justice for all exhibit contains disturbing photographic images of real victims of abortion and genocide
8168295 we look at the moneys importance to the group and also its potential benefits to the community
8168296 weve granted requests for everything from 20 to 10 000
8168297 we usually have four or five groups request money at each meeting
8168298 the acting side of the process builds up to such a quick climax youre in and youre out its a very short lived intense experience
8168299 but this has been completely different for me it takes months of getting ready and knowing everything there is to know about the play i can only trust that i have a good enough sense of what my vision is for it
8168300 its interesting because obviously you always have to keep in mind whod be a good fit for certain roles
8168301 but right now my brain is fried theres a big list of people that im so interested in
8168302 right off the bat you realize you cant work with some people because they seem too fixed in their ways to open up to suggestions
8168303 someone you could want desperately to work with they simply dont fit the part theres one small detail like an intense dialect or they might not look old enough for a certain role
8168304 sometimes theyll forget a line and they just shut down and stop really putting themselves out there
8168305 were supposed to know the play best and what we want to do with it
8168306 were just trying to make some sense out of it
8168307 the reason we wanted to try out facebook was because students are now getting information in nontraditional ways
8168308 social networks are what people are using and we need to be able to leverage that technology for public safety
8168309 were trying to build pipelines for sharing information any way we can
8168310 people dont trust facebook all the time and not everyone is on there
8168311 if you go and sit down at a computer it could be hours after the emergency happened
8168312 msg is an additive to an additive and even within an additive they could refer to msg by a different name
8168313 i agree that msg is safe it is not toxic
8168314 but my question is whether or not msg is healthy
8168315 glutamate amounts to somewhere between 10 percent and 20 percent of all the proteins that we eat
8168316 there is no way to avoid a large intake of msg every day from simply eating food
8168317 we try to limit the use of it because it is controversial
8168318 i personally dont think msg causes a lot of problems but like anything else if you overuse it it is not a good thing
8168319 certainly if there is any question about a product health wise and its a product we dont need to use we avoid using it on grounds of health alerts
8168320 over the last five years weve averaged close to a 1 million operating budget
8168321 i think the economy is definitely starting to affect college media in a way that its been affecting industry media for a while
8168322 its still too soon to say if its a trend this is really the first story ive heard about someone cutting their production
8168323 weve got a slight decline over the last two years
8168324 were looking at how we can generate funds from online from other publications
8168325 readership of the paper is very strong were finding that to be very steady
8168326 seventy six percent of college students read their newspaper on a daily basis
8168327 even the five papers who make the most online still only make around 50 000 a year which in a 1 million or 2 million a year budget isnt much
8168328 whether it is in print whether we can make that advertising model sustainable or whether we need a new model its just going to take a little bit of time to get through that planning process
8168329 i hope this will be a bit of a wake up call for some other papers to do some strategic planning
8168330 its an experiment in how to do science differently across different disciplines
8168331 its probably the new way that science needs to be done
8168332 i think for us the biggest challenge has been coordination
8168333 obviously the benefit is that you have all these new schools that you can collaborate with but theres a downside because everyone is used to doing things a little differently
8168334 i would also say that the research triangle is to some extent an inspiration for him he would like this to become the triangle for nutrition
8168335 i think theyre hopeful and starting to view the campus as part of their community

8168340 aint it funny how the way you feel shows on your face and no matter how you try to hide it it states your case
8168341 it is amazing what marrying your cousin does to people
8168342 they reacted the same way every white parent grandparent does when they find out their daughter is dating a black man like a complete moron
8168343 lurban food and shelter are survival instincts not sex you fool ive read some pretty stupid comments around here but youre definitely as dumb as they come trust me girls most men would give this lunkhead even less time then you he obviously hasnt evolved
8168344 funny all the righteous indignation and caustic language towards a shamed and apologetic john edwards john mccain has had far more affairs
8168345 it is very unlikely that any jefferson other than thomas jefferson was the father of hemingss six children

8168351 whether you do x or x ill do y remain loyal simply because it is expected of me
8168352 the health of u s banks is quickly deteriorating and the government fund set up to protect depositors might not have enough money to insure everybody analysts told abcnews com
8168353 the federal deposit insurance corporation or fdic insures bank deposits of up to 100 000 at nearly 8 500 of the nations banks and also keeps a watch list of banks that it considers in trouble
8168354 thanks to a collapsing housing market and a weak economy a growing number of banks are struggling to stay afloat with not enough cash on hand to cover losses from bad loans
8168355 at the beginning of the year 90 banks were on the fdic watch list there are now 117 fdic chairwoman sheila c bair announced at a news conference this afternoon that is the highest number in five years but some analysts expect the list to grow even more in coming months

8168357 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8168358 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8168359 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8168360 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8168361 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up
8168362 i knew it hit somewhere i could tell it was close then everybody started yelling and i ran over there
8168363 part of the roof was knocked off and it landed on braniff road and knocked down some power lines
8168364 barack is a fine person but i dont think hes ready to be president
8168365 well be monitoring every word that comes from the podium looking for factual inaccuracies responding with whats appropriate
8168366 its important because you cant let a news cycle much less an hour or two hours go with an attack that is a distortion of your candidates record
8168367 the city is bigger than that and i think unisys is bigger than that
8168368 theyre still very positive about philadelphia we still have a more than great shot at having unisys in philadelphia
8168369 we recognize and support the efforts to grow develop and attract business to our city
8168370 although there are currently efforts under way to amend the zoning code the role of the board is to enforce the current zoning code
8168371 people do not want to live in an office building

8168376 the governor is worried about 80 dogs being shot by their owner
8168377 and im wondering how many people how many children is it going to take before these laws get stricter for hit and run drivers
8168378 the problem is many pedestrians do not own vehicles so they dont have their own coverage
8168379 the best option is always to wait for police and turn yourself in
8168380 its not worth torturing somebodys family and friends who never did anything to you
8168381 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8168382 i think average voters are turned off by the tearing down
8168383 but not by the building up i think voters like to see people coming together
8168384 hillary at points disappointed me on how far she went to try to tear barack down but i take my hat off to her for how shes handling it now
8168385 it depends how much you want to win all that early stuff was intramural sports now were into the real season and in the end she wants him to win i believe that
8168386 the question is does that tough clinton obama primary make obama tougher a lot of hillary supporters are saying yes
8168387 i believe it does you really dont know what to believe
8168388 could you go home at night knowing that was happening
8168389 we want to see this company thrive now and in the future
8168390 we needed some help and the guild was willing to help us out
8168391 im glad they have enough confidence in what were doing were very appreciative

8168397 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8168398 he is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful
8168399 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8168400 you know were democrats theres always somebody complaining about something
8168401 but i dont think anybody is distraught that ed rendell has compared sen obama to adlai stevenson

8168404 as our buyers look for new quality suppliers from india private sourcing events provide an ideal platform connecting them with a range of pre screened suppliers able to meet their specific standards
8168405 as we increase our sourcing from india we are working with many suppliers for the first time and that increases our risk as suppliers we will meet at private sourcing events have been pre screened this helps us greatly reduce our risk and find quality suppliers with more sourcing options in less time
8168406 we are eager to expand to new markets and we are now focused on producing high end products private sourcing events give us the opportunity to meet the international buyers who are looking for our quality products this is an incredible opportunity for us

8168412 nel corso degli ultimi tre anni spiega la ricerca con riferimento a un paniere di prodotti orticoli costruito in modo omogeneo la differenza tra il prezzo alla produzione e quello allingrosso risulta in italia superiore al 100 contro un valore mediamente del 60 in spagna e in francia
8168413 in questa fase per litalia si legge nello studio utilizzando i dati dellistituto di servizi per il mercato agricolo alimentare ismea si osserva un incremento medio di prezzo superiore al 50 nel complesso dal produttore al consumatore il ricarico totale del comparto e mediamente del 200
8168414 nel caso di filiere cortissime passaggio diretto dal produttore al venditore
8168415 prossimo al 300 nei casi in cui siano presenti 3 o 4 intermediari oltre al produttore e al distributore finale
8168416 a causa dellelevata stagionalit e deperibilit dei prodotti o a fronte di una scarsa organizzazione della produzione agricola
8168417 rappresentata in circa il 60 dei casi da un solo intermediario coincidente di norma con il mercato allingrosso
8168418 si caratterizza ancora per la presenza di una moltitudine di strutture di piccola dimensione a fronte dei 19 mercati allingrosso esistenti in francia e dei 23 in spagna in italia sono presenti quasi 150 strutture
8168419 una dimensione pari a meno di un quinto di quella delle realt minori in francia e spagna
8168420 poco meno della met delle strutture italiane risale agli anni sessanta e settanta e quasi un terzo e antecedente alla seconda guerra mondiale
8168421 il complesso dei mercati allingrosso si presenta insufficiente a trattare unofferta agricola rilevante ridistribuendola verso altri mercati di sbocco
8168422 iniziato in italia in ritardo rispetto agli altri paesi europei
8168423 manca un sistema informatico adeguato sia per la rilevazione dei prezzi sia per garantire la tracciabilit dei prodotti

8168427 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8168428 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8168429 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato
8168430 this experience was way different from anything ive ever had before
8168431 the price we paid was minimum compared to a chinese man sentenced to two years of hard labor for practicing his religion
8168432 because we were more dangerous and more offensive even though we were doing media work
8168433 blanket reeking of urine a dirty tupperware like bowl and filthy spoon in which rice and vegetables were dumped drinking water was available for only 15 minutes early in the morning if you could find a bottle otherwise you wont have water that day
8168434 what we were doing was far more egregious because we were trying to split tibet from the motherland and send images around the world
8168435 we dont know what to do with you either shoot you or slit your throat
8168436 after youre up for 36 hours straight pushing is magnified a bit
8168437 my people are tortured when they go to labor camps
8168438 its the first major final of my career so im pretty excited
8168439 we have under achieved this season for sure you could say we have had injuries but at the end of the day we have still had 13 players against 13 on the pitch
8168440 we have a few things to fix up for next year but its just about concentrating on the final now
8168441 it would be a shame for us to throw away all the hard work that we have done to reach the final as we have had a really hard year
8168442 st helens are a great side in great form which is why it was important for us to win last week against harlequins it will take something special to beat them but im looking for us to do it
8168443 none of the family from home could come but theyre all looking forward to it
8168444 the wife and the kids will be coming with me and its going to be a really nice experience for us all im excited but i think that theyre more excited about it than i am
8168445 this is all i have been used to since i came to hull though with the semi finals of the play offs last year and a final this year i thought that the semi final of the cup was good but this is going to be something else
8168446 ill get all the tourism out of the way when we have a walk around wembley on friday though
8168447 i think that at the beginning of the year i started off pretty slow through injuries
8168448 our form has been poor too but when rich came in he said that we should take it a game at a time and thats what we have done hes done a great job
8168449 but at the end of the day this is going to be senator obamas decision it is not a negotiation this is senator obamas show
8168450 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8168451 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8168452 part of the the problem now is that these conventions are so heavily covered that the images are more important than the substance
8168453 so i can understand the desire of party leaders to present as harmonious a front as possible
8168454 now the media often grades the conventions on how harmonious they are
8168455 if there is any discord thats held against the party
8168456 i was gutted last year i played every round and just missed out on the final
8168457 i only found on the wednesday my parents spent a few quid to go down there and didnt get to see me now im just happy to make up for it this year it makes you more determined
8168458 i wasnt bitter but i was upset and disappointed i was made up for cloughie though he scored a try at wembley and has come on in leaps and bounds
8168459 it was a couple of months later when i was in the gym doing weights and daniel came in and handed it to me
8168460 it was a bit of a surprise but it balanced out winning the world club challenge after not playing in the team that had won the grand final
8168461 i didnt really deserve to play in that game but i did deserve to play at wembley
8168462 it did cross my mind but i tried not to think about it my family were the ones doing the worrying and they mentioned it
8168463 i would have been devastated to miss out again but now im made up and i cant wait to get out there
8168464 saints have been blessed with front rowers in the last few years and i knew it was going to be difficult this year to get a few games
8168465 when injuries cropped up the chance came to step up and take some responsibility i have achieved what i wanted to achieve namely play some good rugby and not let anybody down
8168466 but the season isnt over yet all the things we have done so far mean nothing weve won nothing yet and it is the next month or so is that counts
8168467 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta

8168499 the audio world has more products of bogus quality and shills promoting them than any other industry bar none

8168501 stand in relation to scientific audio as creation scientists and their assorted publications do to legitimate studies of geology and anthropology scientific half truths and misinterpretations are skillfully used to substantiate religious views of the subject contrary to scientific method desired conclusions lead the search instead of a reasonably unbiased search leading to whatever conclusions might be revealed
8168502 science is there to be used not to dictate what is true
8168503 laboratory testing properly done can tell us pretty much everything we need to know about the performance of a typical piece of electronics we know what the important characteristics are how to measure them and how to interpret the results
8168504 the patterns scientists observe in nature are intimately connected with the patterns of their minds with their concepts thoughts and values thus the scientific results they obtain and the technological applications they investigate will be conditioned by their frame of mind

8168523 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

8168525 if we raise our gas price to what wed call normal gas pricing what people would pay in other cities around the world i dont know how that would be impacted on the final price down here in perth
8168526 with higher costs of supply already impacting the business there was already significant upward pressure on was industrial gas prices
8168527 as with all businesses woodside must pass on increased cost
8168528 the idea that we can somehow afford this cost into our business is unrealistic
8168529 this unexpected new tax is no different to any other cost
8168530 it will be passed on to customers over the next few months and years as we reopen and renew domestic contracts and well recover as much as we can if not all of the tax burden
8168531 we cant go into a loss mode at that plant where we put it into the pipeline

8168546 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8168547 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8168548 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8168549 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8168550 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8168551 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8168552 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8168553 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8168554 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8168555 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

8168715 partai golkar tidak bisa berbuat apa apa dengan kepindahan kadernya ke partai lain jika terkait dengan urusan penetapan caleg misalnya urutannya sampai 100 tetapi yang masuk hanya satu orang mau bagaimana lagi

8168730 it was an exciting day there were a lot of expectations and we had high hopes
8168731 with young players its so important to build confidence but we lost confidence early
8168732 we were playing on our heels early in the season
8168733 were not going to be a nickel and dime team
8168734 if you stop the run you force teams to become one dimensional and into bad situations
8168735 we were out there almost losing the game and the defense was only letting up field goals for four quarters
8168736 i remember looking up to elliot vallejo and jon grant and now i look around and think wow these guys might be looking up to me but its really the young guys team its just our job to prepare them
8168737 raid z wouldnt require any special hardware it doesnt need nvram for correctness and it doesnt need write buffering for good performance with raid z zfs makes good on the original raid promise it provides fast reliable storage using cheap commodity disks

8168741 high rate of attrition is a serious problem affecting our strategic programmes and that is why we have invited the foreign experts to guide us in attracting and retaining top talents
8168742 the militants took six people inclduing three women and two children as hostage one of them has been rescued and efforts are on to resuce others too
8168743 though tension prevails in kandhamal the situation is improving gradually security forces have been able to enter inaccessible areas by removing obstacles placed by miscreants
8168744 i must say the moldovan had the best defence among all the boxers in beijing he never dropped his guard during the bout
8168745 on the other hand akhil is a very fearless boxer and he plays with his guards down but thats his style technically there was no problem
8168746 he is a very emotional person and was really affected by the quarterfinal loss but put up a brave face to keep the spirits up in the camp he said so what if i have lost jitender and vijender have to accomplish the task and he kept himself upbeat for them
8168747 he always had the confidence and he now has the required experience and that made all the difference in 2012 he can definitely go for the gold
8168748 things are looking upward for the indian boxers as you can see the way jitender 51 kg fought it is one of the best olympics for any boxer
8168749 earlier we were seventh in the asian rankings and now we are fourth and if we had not missed these two bronze we would have been on top india has massive talent pool in boxing
8168750 thats the plan so far lets see how things go from here
8168751 its been a hectic four months now and i want to go home
8168752 they were always at par with other boxers in the world in technique but they lacked confidence psychology was the difference between the athens and the beijing lot
8168753 akhil jitender and vijender were the ready for anything in the ring and after this bronze medal their confidence will be further boosted
8168754 during my talks with union commerce minister kamal nath he said that sez projects should be completed within a particular time or else the centre has the power to denotify them
8168755 we will be meeting very soon next month or october
8168756 its still the second round before the momentum builds up and we begin to exchange lists it will take a couple of more rounds
8168757 i normally dont talk about my personal life but his name is raj kundra we met a year ago
8168758 for the next 18 months ive got my hands full with work so i cant really think of marriage yet but after that i definitely want it to culminate in marriage and of course im dying to have a family at least two children
8168759 i spoke to her and we exchanged numbers it was really emotional i can only ask people to pray for her because there is a lot of power in prayers
8168760 we have issued shoot at sight order in the wake of large scale violence in some curfew bound areas of kandhamal district
8168761 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances

8168763 we stopped the political intelligence office pio functions to honour the feelings of political party leaders
8168764 the government is trying to establish a police state before the national elections
8168765 it is not the job of the police to keep track of the activities of political parties
8168766 the police department should open a new wing to improve the deteriorating law and order instead of snooping on political parties
8168767 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8168768 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so
8168769 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed onto
8168770 iava is pleased that mrs obama and her family are focusing on iraq and afghanistan veterans during this convention week
8168771 iava looks forward to joining forces with mrs obama local iava members military families and denver residents to let the men and women serving in harms way know we appreciate their service as the festivities roll on in denver and minneapolis iava is proud to give local residents a way to give thanks to those serving in baghdad and kabul
8168772 oil carried as fuel in large cargo ships can result in a major oil spill in the event of an accident
8168773 although we work to prevent accidents in the first place this enforcement policy will make sure that cargo ships such as tankers have pre identified and arranged for the resources needed to respond effectively should an accident occur
8168774 were here today to do our initial assessment of the damage here in gori
8168775 then well work with usaid and the united states government to go ahead and support the government of georgia and the rebuilding of this area
8168776 so far we have the russians in the poti port theyre controlling some major economic engines and we hope that they will leave this country
8168777 the major help is the economic help and the political help is also significant for us and military rehabilitation as well we have to rehabilitate all we lost from russia because it is very important in this region when you have a neighbor like russia that you should be able to defend yourself
8168778 you know the first thing that strikes me is im impressed by the amount of activity here in gori and it seems like the people of gori the local government have committed themselves to cleaning up as quickly as possible because there is activity all throughout the city
8168779 theyre cleaning up all the damage that had been done recently so i think that in and of itself is a good sign and that will probably facilitate also a lot of returns back to gori
8168780 barack and michelle listened and they understood it was like talking with family it became clear that they are regular people
8168781 just bringing people together so real changes can be made that affect the everyday lives of people like me
8168782 joe from next door cannot end life on the earth
8168783 the power and the story how the crafted presidential narrative has determined political success from george washington to george w bush
8168784 you start out with almost an anti intellectual strain there i want someone whos like me so they can understand me and know what i need government to be doing
8168785 to have a bad bowling score is good people see you as human
8168786 no matter how educated you are how successful you are you still need to be just folks
8168787 you want someone who you can say hes like me but i know in a crisis situation he can handle it
8168788 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8168789 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8168790 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8168791 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8168792 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8168793 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8168794 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8168795 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8168796 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8168797 its important that people of faith are being listened to just like other constituencies that were not marginalized
8168798 just because were participating in the process and engaging people who may not agree with us doesnt mean were just a mascot
8168799 lets be honest religion has been used and abused by politics
8168800 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
8168801 reaching out to us and im not naive as to why they want our votes
8168802 but they wont get them and keep them unless they continue the momentum of adopting policies that promote the sanctity of life
8168803 id like to see obama address that say that voice is no longer welcome
8168804 i certainly didnt feel used obviously politics is politics i dont want to be naive i also dont want to be cynical
8168805 the majority of our party people they are people of faith
8168806 when we get elected we dont check our faith at the door we may not wear it on our sleeve
8168807 we can no longer be looked at as this couch potato what about me
8168808 if we hadnt been here we wouldnt have made those connections
8168809 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8168810 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8168811 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8168812 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8168813 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8168814 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8168815 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8168816 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8168817 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8168818 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8168819 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
8168820 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8168821 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8168822 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8168823 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8168824 no one works for someone we all just work together
8168825 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8168826 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8168827 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8168828 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8168829 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8168830 make our government an instrument of the public good not of private plunder
8168831 ill vote for her on the first ballot because thats what i was elected to do
8168832 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8168833 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8168834 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8168835 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8168836 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8168837 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8168838 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8168839 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8168840 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8168841 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8168842 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
8168843 the goal is to galvanize the sustainable food movement and bring it to the masses
8168844 food is love so how do we make it not just a privilege but a right
8168845 case study napa valley wine growing for the next thousand years and howell mountain history and la jota vineyards
8168846 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8168847 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8168848 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8168849 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8168850 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8168851 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8168852 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8168853 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8168854 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8168855 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8168856 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8168857 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8168858 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8168859 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8168860 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8168861 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8168862 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8168863 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8168864 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8168865 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8168866 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8168867 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8168868 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8168869 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8168870 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8168871 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8168872 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8168873 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8168874 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8168875 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8168876 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8168877 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8168878 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8168879 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8168880 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8168881 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8168882 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8168883 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8168884 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8168885 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8168886 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8168887 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8168888 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8168889 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8168890 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8168891 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8168892 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8168893 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8168894 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8168895 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8168896 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8168897 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8168898 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
8168899 this is a planning took where all things are going
8168900 what was scary was how many people didnt put two and two together that wheat berries make flour
8168901 im selling local eggs and i dont even know how far the feed has traveled
8168902 how can i call them local eggs when the wheat has traveled so far
8168903 once people try freshly ground flour its a little bit like pasture eggs
8168904 its like wow this is what its supposed to taste like
8168905 farmers were saying to chefs and chefs to farmers ive been looking for you all my life
8168906 sibella bridged the gap between folks who were way too busy in the fields and folks who were way too busy in restaurants
8168907 i knew farmers who didnt taste a thing they grew it was about production and yield and that was the end of it
8168908 its do we want this farmers broccoli di cicco or that ones the tasting was the seed of what we have today
8168909 true blood is coming to hbo on sept 7 the latest offering from alan ball six feet under and a new twist on the vampire genre does it suck a preview of the shows first two hours reveals that balls southern fried take on fang banging has real bite
8168910 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8168911 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8168912 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8168913 the food will remain the same all the employees will too
8168914 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8168915 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8168916 a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 they are past that now
8168917 if they feel that a western orientation is not an option they will be looking for friends where they can find them starting with tehran and caracas
8168918 i think you will now see a more unified position that russia is clearly overstepping its bounds and must be contained
8168919 im not saying we should support them secessionist movements in russia im saying thats a potential option
8168920 if the russians are playing a dirty game we shouldnt be a nice guy this is not a vicars tea party
8168921 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8168922 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
8168923 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
8168924 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
8168925 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
8168926 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
8168927 thats something that obviously we are going to have to evaluate given the current situation i dont have any announcements on that one way or another
8168928 when ukraine prioritises its national interests it goes against russias interests and of course there will be conflict
8168929 and russia has broken through a psychological barrier to start this kind of war on former soviet territory georgia had created itself in the shape of an enemy of russia and many in russia already see us in the same way we probably rank third in the list of russias leading enemies
8168930 in that situation then russia will start playing games start provoking ukraine especially with crimea
8168931 when we think about our position on georgia i have no doubts the loss of sovereignty putting into doubt the territorial integrity of georgia this means revising the sovereignty of all
8168932 there is a reason to be wary in the short term future there is a threat in that ukraine is similar to georgia in terms of what has happened in recent years
8168933 but i find it difficult to think that the threat posed is a military one russia relies on the fact that it has more of an influence over ukraine economically
8168934 if ukraine sorts out its domestic situation and consolidates its foreign policy in terms of european and atlantic integration and this goes at a good pace then we can avoid the south ossetian scenario
8168935 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8168936 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war but we of course dont want it
8168937 in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners in the west
8168938 if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision and the situation will be calm
8168939 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8168940 it is the first attempt in europe since nazi germany and stalin of a big country to annex the territory of another country
8168941 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8168942 this simply will be dead on arrival in the u n security council
8168943 contrary to the principles of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
8168944 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted
8168945 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
8168946 i think this is an indication that russia has opted for further aggravation in relations with the west and a very serious rift this time
8168947 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8168948 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us

8168959 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
8168960 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
8168961 we dont need an illusion of partnership when they surround us by bases from all sides they drag more and more states into the north atlantic bloc and they tell us dont worry everythings fine of course we dont like that
8168962 its difficult to count them but they say they are deploying at least 20 at each checkpoint and two or three heavy armored vehicles
8168963 we will focus on a concentrated international effort to help georgia to get rid of the russian forces
8168964 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
8168965 alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia
8168966 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods

8168975 underage drinking and alcohol misuse by young people is already beginning to have serious repercussions on public health and young peoples life prospects and will continue to do so for future generations unless something is done to tackle the problem
8168976 we know that 1 603 young people were admitted to london hospitals with alcohol specific problems last year but this is likely to be just the tip of the iceberg our investigation will uncover the true scale of the problem and i encourage londoners to help us do that by sending us their views on this issue
8168977 the assemblys decision to pursue a more detailed understanding of alcohol misuse by the capitals youth is a timely one
8168978 for many young people experimentation with alcohol is a natural part of the transition into adulthood unfortunately and for a complicated mix of reasons youthful curiosity can sometimes give way to more harmful drinking patterns
8168979 by getting a street level sense of what motivates young londoners to drink heavily we will be in a better position to plan a co ordinated and effective response

8168983 the last time the expectations index of ifo was this low the german economy fell into a sharp recession
8168984 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations

8168987 an increasing trend is bringing cocaine by aircraft instead of by boat into west africa then it is taken on by land or ship to europe across some dangerous and difficult terrain
8168988 we are forcing criminals to raise their risk factors by turning up the heat and forcing them out of their comfort zones
8168989 its too early to tell how much cocaine is arriving but it is not a small amount
8168990 corruption has always been in the back of our minds in difficult operating environments such as africa it is a challenge to find partners who we can trust but we are making headway
8168991 it appears that additional enforcement efforts have had little adverse effect on the availability of illicit drugs in the uk
8168992 since 2000 average street prices in the uk have fallen consistently for heroin cocaine ecstasy and cannabis
8168993 there is some evidence to suggest that a two tier market for powder cocaine has emerged in the uk during recent years at both wholesale and street levels these data suggest that there is now an expanding market for cheaper heavily adulterated cocaine among young people and students for example and that higher purity cocaine is aimed at more affluent buyers
8168994 over the past 10 years cocaine has become increasingly available in the uk while it still retains its glamour image prices have fallen and put the drug within the reach of a wide range of people for whom cocaine has become an unremarkable part of their lifestyle
8168995 it seems as if this process began with the break up of the large cocaine cartels in colombia during the early 1990s resulting in the development of several smaller cartels who needed to find new outlets beyond the traditional us market
8168996 the government has got to be seen to be helping ordinary people in these difficult economic times the price of oil is going up and therefore fuel prices are going up
8168997 my own view on the prospect of a windfall tax on energy companies is that the government will be cautious about introducing something which has an implicit retrospective element to it
8168998 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills
8168999 every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere
8169000 we will not seek to extend further restrictions on food advertising beyond those already implemented by ofcom following the ofcom review we will look to a voluntary agreement extending across all media which balances freedom to advertise products with specific cross industry and government action to promote improved diet including consumption of increased fruit and vegetables
8169001 these scenarios are ones that people recognise the theme of getting ready for a night out massively juxtaposes with the feeling of how did i get here at the end of the night
8169002 it is not about telling people not to drink it is about drinking sensibly and not ending up in major trouble
8169003 it is less about finger wagging and more about subtly highlighting the harm that can be done
8169004 our defense improved later in the match we started reacting to what they were going to do
8169005 we had a huge lead and kind of let it slip away but im going to let them play so they learn that they have to fight for what they want thats the biggest thing holding us back now is knowing how it win

8169013 the veline model would not be a problem if it was one of many models offered on television but we dont have television that seems to be capable of other options
8169014 for men its a bit of a trap and for women they represent a model of success and fashion
8169015 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time
8169016 it privileges easy success through shortcuts and without daily effort

8169180 dice il regista nel corso del suo primo incontro con lax durante il quale parla di come gli vengono in mente le idee per i suoi film
8169181 a volte ho dei flash improvvisi come quando mi venne in mente lidea di creare un ragno in una ragnatela nel film
8169182 del tutto casuale quando nei miei film emergono punti di vista politici
8169183 quasi tutto e allo stesso tempo si tratta di materiale cos esagerato e distorto che ha gli elementi della narrativa non della saggistica
8169184 la vera comicit si basa sul personaggio non sulla trama ed questo il motivo per cui diane keaton per lunghi anni la sua musa sempre buffa non ho mai conosciuto unattrice che mi facesse ridere pi di lei
8169185 molto noioso esaminare una per una le idee che vengono fuori da quel sacchetto
8169186 anche quando mi chiudo in sala di montaggio mi porto dietro quel sacchetto da cui tiro fuori certe idee e ne metto via altre per poi utilizzarle al momento opportuno non butto via niente i foglietti li elimino solamente quando unidea lho gi realizzata
8169187 facile per me farmi travolgere da un mondo di fantasia mi calo del tutto nella vicenda e ne provo un piacere profondo non semplice da spiegare ma immagino che sia la stessa sensazione che prova il pittore nel continuare a ritoccare la sua opera aggiungendo dettagli

8169193 since i joined the devgen board in september 2006 devgen has transformed rapidly from a pure technology supplier into a fully integrated agribusiness company focused on nematicides and on hybrid seed from research to farmer with emphasis on hybrid rice seed and rice biotech traits
8169194 the likelihood that conflict of interest issues arise with my previous employer bayer ag for whom hybrid rice is also a strategic crop is therefore increasing i felt that to assure good corporate governance and avoid personal conflicts it was best to step aside and resign from the devgen board
8169195 we thank pol for his valuable contribution to the company and we respect his decision
8169196 in a short time hybrid rice has indeed become a highly competitive field in which devgen is now a premium player and i look forward to supporting the company in its ambitious growth plans to become a leading player in this developing market space
8169197 homeland energy purchase of appolo fuels to add 114 million tons measured amp indicated coal to homelands global resource
8169198 the appolo mine is an excellent example of the type of asset that homeland plans to focus on for future acquisition
8169199 the growth profile for these assets both in terms of operations and in terms of sales is going to assist in the significant movement of homeland toward the mid tier of international coal companies
8169200 we have been very impressed with the production rates and operations of the appolo mine appolos operations environmental and management track records are enviable and fit well with homelands corporate mandate for safe clean efficient and profitable operations
8169201 based upon the current margins at appolo we believe that debt financing the acquisition is the most appropriate option to pursue and well within the means and capabilities of the company
8169202 sas is compatible with sata which enable users such as it managers to combine high performance sas and high capacity sata storage applications allowing them to choose the most cost effective solution for their needs
8169203 sata drives can communicate over the same sas hardware giving the customer a choice for instance our dual port sas enclosures support 24 7 high availability systems such as web server appliances while routine backups can be offloaded to higher capacity lower cost per gb sata drives this flexibility also enables migration to more space saving and energy efficient solutions
8169204 in addition to flexibility another key advantage is speed sas and sata both provide max transfer rates of up to 3gb s but with sas full duplex architecture you get simultaneous bi directional data and command transfers providing effective bandwidth of 6gb s therefore crus new 4 bay enclosure featuring a unique 4 port host connector can provide a speedy 24gb s aggregate throughput

8169210 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8169211 if you ask those former clinton voters who they want to be for barack obama or john mccain they would say barack obama overwhelmingly
8169212 were all worried because we should as a party be doing better
8169213 i am so freaking proud of her i cant stand it she is the leader of my life but she just gave me my marching orders barack won the election
8169214 there is no sense that the party has a sense of urgency
8169215 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual but its a lousy soundbite
8169216 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis
8169217 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8169218 if john mccain has his way your bills will continue to grow and your paycheck will continue to shrink
8169219 in an obama biden administration american families will finally get a new deal for a new economy a tax cut they earned healthcare they can afford a pension they can keep and a college education they deserve

8169234 there is a way to spin the change message that you can weave biden into that narrative but that will be the challenge for the campaign frankly
8169235 for voters who dont know sen obama very well it helps provide validation for his agenda and his ability to be president having an agenda for change is not inconsistent with having tried and tested voices to discuss that agenda
8169236 i think bill clinton is a great messenger because well take the 90s anytime 22 million new jobs and joe biden is a fighter and we always need a fighter

8169259 people are cracking down ninety nine percent of the players ive talked to support it a couple of players may take issue with it but its not a big deal
8169260 i believe its good for the tour and it applies to everyone not just the koreans there are only a few cases where players are unable to do their professional duties within a few months those people will have no problems with the proper resources and tools all players on tour have the ability to excel at english
8169261 we started zeroing in on players being successful not just on the course but in the broader sports entertainment marketplace
8169262 to do that they have to communicate effectively this is an important thing for the players and for the lpga tour to succeed its important for the future

8169288 appears to be most common in sub saharan africa and south asia
8169289 rare in the developed world because emergency obstetric is readily available
8169290 these are the most to be pitied in the world theyre alone in the world ashamed of their injuries for lepers or aids victims there are organizations that help but nobody knows about these women or helps them
8169291 begins with the low socioeconomic status of women in the third world compounded by malnutrion limited social roles illiteracy and lack of formal education
8169292 this in turn leads to early marriage and childbearing before pelvic growth has been completed virtually always in parts of the world where there is little if any access to emergency obstetric services
8169293 when cephalopelvic disproportion occurs the lack of obstetric care means that women may be trapped in obstructed labour for days on end sometimes for as long as a week without relief
8169294 you go to a hospital and they have no working facilities
8169295 the result of sexual violence rape so brutal often using gun barrels beer bottles or sticks that a tear develops between a womans vagina and her bladder or rectum or both
8169296 prolonged obstructed labour the soft tissues of the pelvis are compressed between the descending babys head and the mothers vagina and bladder vesicovaginal or vagina and rectum rectovaginal or both that leaves her with urinary or faecal incontinence or both
8169297 the women for her condition and some women blame themselves
8169298 people ran from me even members of my own family my husband abandoned me nobody talked to me nobody visited me for that whole year i stayed indoors
8169299 research shows that girls and women with fistula often eat alone sleep alone and pray alone
8169300 its her misfortune that shes alive those who die are luckier
8169301 as she wipes the tears from her daughter she adds she tells me to kill her
8169302 i gave birth to twins one of who died and i developed this problem i was completely on my own as my husband had to go for work i not only had to take care of the newborn but the older two my 11 year old helped me as much as she could but after a few days i had to take them from school as i just couldnt manage i had to continuously wash my soiled cloths and i smelled so much i could barely keep myself sane i remember crying all the time so in between taking care of the home the chores and nursing the young one tell me did i get time to miss my dead baby
8169303 syed recalled that one patient sold her two young daughters to come up with money for the surgery only to learn that she did not need any money
8169304 spurned by their families and communities they lie at the very bottom of the social pyramid reeking of urine and stool outcast illiterate improvished sexually unattractive powerless women often under 20 sometimes as young as 11 or12 years of age
8169305 may consent to procedures they do not really understand placing their faith blindly in the skills of the strange white doctors who have turned to help them
8169306 we need to provide an alternative for those so ripped and hopeless they can no longer think for themselves
8169307 facing familial and social rejection and unable to make a living by themselves many women with fistula live for years without any financial or social support
8169308 some cannot cope with the pain and suffering and resort to suicide
8169309 to be a woman in africa is a truly terrible thing
8169310 until this decade outside nations that might be able to help effectively ignored the problem

8169312 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

8169316 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8169317 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8169318 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8169319 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8169320 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8169321 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8169322 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8169323 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8169324 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8169325 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8169326 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8169327 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8169328 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8169329 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8169330 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8169331 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8169332 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8169333 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8169334 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8169335 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8169336 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8169337 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8169338 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8169339 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8169340 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8169341 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8169342 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8169343 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8169344 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8169345 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8169346 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8169347 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8169348 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8169349 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8169350 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8169351 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8169352 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8169353 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8169354 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8169355 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8169356 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8169357 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8169358 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8169359 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8169360 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8169361 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8169362 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8169363 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8169364 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8169365 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8169366 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8169367 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8169368 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8169369 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8169370 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8169374 dwan had an ongoing thing where he was feeling a little bit of tightness there
8169375 they did an mri just as a precautionary procedure and they caught something which was really fortunate and a great job by our medical team as a result hes going to be out for the year while they can correct it hell play again but its going to take a good part of this year to get it corrected its not something you could take a chance with and let him play
8169376 edwards is a kid that everybody knew was a second round pick and they thought he was a bust
8169377 but it takes some guys a little longer sometimes to get it and this guy was getting it
8169378 everybody in the league knew about him we had big plans for him this year but unfortunately he got hurt and the next guys got to step up hopefully we can find that guy
8169379 everyones working their hardest to get back and get ready for the first game
8169380 well go with what weve got and hopefully everyones ready to go on that first day
8169381 if you make the right decision somebody is going to be mad you make the wrong decision and somebody is really going to be mad that is going to help baseball that is going to help the umpires im glad they did it
8169382 the game is the game let the game be pure in what it is
8169383 i guess if they can move into a new yankee stadium they can have instant replay the game is evolving much to my chagrin
8169384 they better be sure that theyve got the kinks worked out
8169385 otherwise they are going to set themselves up for some embarrassing situations that could possibly occur and i dont think major league baseball at this particular point in time needs that
8169386 i find it very strange that with 30games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8169387 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8169388 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future
8169389 i dont think there is anything wrong with it if there is one call you want them to get right its a home run
8169390 thats part of the game its not always a fun part but it is part of it
8169391 i didnt have an off speed pitch i just had a good fastball it didnt matter how hard you threw it theyd hit it because they knew it was coming it taught me that i needed to focus on developing my off speed pitches
8169392 i think the big moment for him last year was in the instructional league when he began throwing a slider
8169393 he was throwing a curveball and he just didnt have the right arm angle but the last game of instructional league he was throwing a nasty slider with good depth thats when we knew that was going to be the pitch for him
8169394 even some nights when i havent had my best stuff ive gotten good results the first year i didnt have a lot of confidence but every year you need to get better and better im in a good spot now
8169395 i think dave trembley has done a great job here he has done everything he could do to change the focus and direction of this organization
8169396 i dont think he ever gets outmanaged i think he has the respect of the players he also has a passion for the game itself that as a player you really appreciate hes into it every day hes not showing up here at 5oclock
8169397 ive got to play every game to win its like i told andy when i took over whether im here one day or two days or two months you dont need to tell me how long and i wont ask ill do the best job i can every time out here
8169398 im just a big proponent of respect for the game would i do something differently if i had a long term contract what would i do differently not play to win that wouldnt be very ethical would it
8169399 we all wish it were better but you have to be a team guy and understand the big picture
8169400 what do they expect were better than we were this season has been a lot more fun than last year i want this season to be remembered for what we accomplished not for how the season could end
8169401 you think i am just drawing but really i am planning to pull caydens hair

8169404 looking back on it i made a lot of mistakes
8169405 i was young brash i thought i had all the answers
8169406 i went from being touted as the youngest coordinator in the country to being fired i know that things have also come full circle for me im living in the house of the guy who fired me its weird
8169407 coach johnson you would see him but he sat back and let the coaches coach the individual positions
8169408 coach niumat does that but hes real hands on he runs around and wants to see everything even all summer youd be lifting and hes right behind you while youre squatting asking you how are you doing
8169409 i cant worry about the way paul coached or what he did im just going to be who i am a phenomenal coach had a phenomenal run hopefully we can continue on with what he did and what he established
8169410 whether this comes back to bite me thats the truth
8169411 all that we need to be successful is in place weve got great kids weve got a great coaching staff if i dont get it done its nobodys fault but mine
8169412 ive always put my own pressures on myself this profession is a bottom line profession
8169413 the pressure to win to beat towson and all the people we play its like that every year
8169414 obviously im involved with a lot more decisions and stuff but ive always been a competitor i hate to lose
8169415 it was a great learning experience for me to be around a guy like that tremendous class it was great preparation for me i knew that if i ever had a chance to be a head coach i wanted to be like him he treated everyone with respect no matter if you were the janitor or the president of the university

8169433 things were rather quiet in the first half of the year as far as the launch of new online casino was concerned
8169434 this slower pace was probably due to a number of factors such as a more mature industry as well as the impact of the uigea launching an online casino these days requires a lot of expertise and funding software providers have also become a lot more discerning when licensing new operators which is a very good thing
8169435 we have been very impressed with the vegas technology casino platforms evolution over the last two years they have improved radically in terms of their game selection and the stability of the software their video slots are now right up there with the very best

8169598 its great that centraldispatch is displaying the price per mile i love that feature
8169599 it just makes my job easier and seeing the price per mile is more important than ever with the high fuel prices now i dont have get out my calculator or go into a different system to get this number its right there in front of me along with all the other pertinent vehicle information
8169600 the price per mile calculator is another tool to help our users transport vehicle more efficiently
8169601 we continuously investigate methods to help make vehicle transportation faster easier and more cost effective for all of our members since many car carriers make decisions based on the price per mile dealers also need that information to price loads appropriately we decided to add that number to the listed vehicle information and let users sort based on it thus eliminating extra steps many users were taking outside of centraldispatch

8169619 he would have been doing circuits which means you are not more than 1 000 feet 305 metres high and couldnt have had time to do it safely
8169620 i watched the plane fly over and thought it was coming very close to another plane then i saw a third plane and that was the one that it hit the right wing tip hit the tail of the plane that crashed mr hilcke told aap
8169621 i think the attention of the pilot would have been on the first plane that he was getting really close to
8169622 i saw them hit each other it crashed down and went out of sight i heard a bang and smoke went up
8169623 i was driving by and i heard a big bang and saw him go into the back of a fellows garage darren told fairfax radio network

8169656 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8169657 we were all very interested to see her reasons for supporting barack obama and so i think its very clear tonight that she was a strong messenger that we have to change our country and that its ok even though we supported hillary clinton in the past to unite behind barack obama
8169658 even though i cant vote im trying my best to support obama and get the word out about how great he is and what an inspiration hes going to be
8169659 ive met a lot of women who switched from hillary to mccain just because they were upset so i think its really really important that she came here its a great thing she had everyone on their feet clapping for her it was an inspiring speech and i think that it spoke to everyone
8169660 people were clinging to her every word in many ways
8169661 she put things in proper perspective she clearly said that it wasnt about her it was about the many americans who are suffering the many americans who want change in this country and so i think that weve left a better and more united party
8169662 it will take us some time but we will be a united party and because of both leaders were going to be a stronger party and well feel that power in november
8169663 we all knew we had two really great leaders here even when our family was divided we were not the ones making fun of each other for that choice
8169664 as long as were not voting mccain i think were all cool about that we really got lucky with hillary and obama this year its great that theyve come together
8169665 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8169666 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this

8169686 the predominant factor in selecting rlm was the hosted solution option this allowed us to get started very simply and easily with no major financial risk or hardware investment we have accomplished in 90 days what would take 9 months with most erp or enterprise systems we are already creating styles cost sheets product catalogs receiving edi orders and issuing production purchase orders in our system our people are already benefiting from the system and loving it
8169687 having implemented earlier rlm client server solutions at other companies i was pleased to learn that they left nothing out when creating the software as a service version not only does it have all of the super mature functionality that they are known for it has a more consistent and user friendly interface that makes our teams more productive once you learn how to do one thing you basically know how to navigate and control the whole system it is so logical and intuitive that our talented staff learned to enter production orders in just 15 minutes
8169688 rlms hosted solution eliminates the barriers of traditional enterprise software it takes away the concerns over server and database platforms runs equally well on pcs and macs and allows us to connect across the globe many fashion companies can benefit from this as they will no longer be held captive by their prior technology investments software as a service is not the future it is the present

8169723 we are very excited about integrating this technology into our software and product offering
8169724 it gives our customers the extremely useful options they have been asking for in secure access control and presents club sentry with a number of new opportunities for introducing its software to new market segments
8169725 the rfid proximity sensor and key fobs are a more secure alternative to a bar code reader and bar coded id cards at the check in desk in that it cannot be copied and re printed like a bar coded id card
8169726 using the rfid system becomes a real advantage when used with the club sentry electronic entry module to open a turnstile or electronically controlled door lock granting 24 hour entry to qualified members without the need for a dedicated employee
8169727 we are very optimistic about the prospects for this functionality in the residential market
8169728 with the addition of the proximity technology we can handle entry to the residential club as well as entry to the property whether unlocking a door or opening a gate the club sentry billing module allows monthly fees common charges and fines to be assessed and collected by invoice credit card or eft

8169744 as a new company we have learned so much so quickly that we have had to look outside our business plan and adjust our strategy along the way
8169745 the challenge has been to harness the power of both online and offline marketing channels and integrate them seamlessly
8169746 online channels particularly search engines are the most efficient at generating new customers while our branded media campaign builds repeat business into lifetime customer value and keeps travel top of mind
8169747 this is a story of production exploration and building ounces
8169748 the metanor management team is very passionate resourceful and talented at what they do most importantly they are able to attract top mine managers geologists miners prospectors and ore millers they also have the latest technology at the bachelor lake mill and that helps to reduce the number of hires and labor costs metanor resources employs about 60 people at both the bachelor lake mill and barry pit metanor management is focusing development on the barry pit to maintain production and cash flow very important in the current junior gold miner markets the development of the bachelor lake mine nelligan property and other mines will proceed over the next few years as the barry pit provides cash flow for their development in this tough financial environment my sense is that only producers will survive the current liquidity crisis money is tight and the failure rate of junior gold miners is high metanor is better positioned than almost all emerging junior gold producers based on their past record of success debt free by december of this year minimal risk of future shareholder dilution and steady managed growth strategy

8169776 as a gay man i know how it feels to be called hateful names simply because of who i am
8169777 i believe one of the unintended consequences of forbidding such words to be spoken is imbuing those words with more power than they should ever have and helping create the illusion that the bigotry and racism expressed by such cruel epithets is less prevalent than it actually is which we all know is sadly not the case
8169778 he has now been assessed under the character test as having passed so he will be given a visa
8169779 i think that showing this in cinemas can only add to the distress and grief felt by the de menezes family and the survivors of 7 7 and those who lost loved ones on that day
8169780 the hurt and pain doesnt go away overnight films like this only serve to stir up those painful memories
8169781 i feel the film paints a picture of the police as being incompetent and biased
8169782 but ultimately it wasnt the predictable plot or poor acting that caused offence to me but the cynical attempt to make money from a tragic event

8169795 our governor has taken a very strong stance on making colorado a part of the new energy economy by bringing jobs to colorado in the field
8169796 the reality is that we really cannot do this without strong institutional support
8169797 the burden on the civil engineers was too much of a headache
8169798 the beauty of the project is that you get to learn from your mistakes which are not things you can make very many of in a professional setting

8169802 the bottom line is we cant afford to go through another four years of this kind of administration
8169803 what we have to do when we go back home is prove that we have an accountable and transparent process all the way through

8169840 saya yakin kami memiliki skuad yang kuat dan saya memiliki keyakinan terhadap para pemain yang saya miliki dibandingkan selalu menunggu terhadap siapa yang mungkin hadir ini bukanlah seorang pemain yang membuat perbedaan
8169841 sekarang tergantung kami sebagai sebuah tim untuk menunjukkan kepribadian kekuatan dan keyakinan hal tersebut akan membuat perbedaan
8169842 kami hanya perlu mencari pemain yang tepat dan jika kami bisa mendapatkannya kami mendapatkannya jika tidak maka artinya tidak apabila tidak ada satu pun yang telah dilakukan hal itu tidak akan membatasi ambisi kami
8169843 kami telah berbicara tentang segala yang dibutuhkan untuk meraih kesuksesan didalam tim dan komitmen dibutuhkan untuk setiap kesuksesan tidak peduli seberapa besar kualitas yang anda miliki
8169844 kita hidup di dunia dimana anda harus menerima kritik dan saran dari setiap orang namun saya tahu skuad saya bagus semangat kami bagus

8169846 if as a nation we are serious about lifting overall student performance and addressing underperformance and underachievement what we would have seen today is a statement of certainty from the prime minister
8169847 the loss of 1000 teaching positions would put upward pressure on class sizes and see the collapse of educational programs as a nation we cannot afford that
8169848 in a broad sense i think ways of rewarding high performance are welcome but the devil is in the detail mr mcalpine said
8169849 so long as its done in a way that reflects the genuine complexity and context of schools and the challenges of both leadership and teaching then i think it will be good thing
8169850 make a real difference but questioned where the funding would come from
8169851 i think it would be much better if the federal government could make direct funding to schools of an average of half a million dollars each and that funding be used to improve the learning in the school rather than the state governments having to meet the federal governments commitments he said
8169852 we are really concerned that this government is really not talking to the people it needs to talk to before its making decisions about whats best for australia she said
8169853 hes stating he knows what parents want well were not sure how hes actually engaged with the parents of state schools when he hasnt run this past the national body
8169854 we dont support any league tables weve seen what they can do in the uk weve seen cases of parents fighting with each other buying addresses raffle tickets so you can get in the line to get into a school thats higher up the league table she said
8169855 its often based on incorrect information and theres much more to a school than the academic results for a start
8169856 we still think theres a lot of opportunity for us to service communities and locations like mataranka
8169857 my whole body had shut down i was in absolute terror

8169859 despite the well reported difficulties in the economies of a number of international markets trading is ahead of where we expected it to be at the half year
8169860 overall we have delivered an excellent performance for the first half of 2008 and we are very confident for the remainder of the year
8169861 we have made a strong start to 2008 and we see excellent growth opportunities ahead as our customers experience increasing global economic and social pressures
8169862 we are worried about the potential effect this could have in the brazilian market as a whole since it does affect investors perception as to how minority shareholders will be treated
8169863 food irradiation began as a result of the atoms for peace program established by president eisenhower in the early 1950s
8169864 scientists have observed serious health problems in lab animals fed irradiated foods
8169865 those include premature death cancer tumors stillbirths mutations organ damage immune system failure and stunted growth in one experiment genetic damage was detected in young children who ate irradiated wheat in some foods irradiation forms chemicals known or suspected to cause cancer and birth defects
8169866 it was firmly concluded by a study conducted in germany as far back as 1926 that irradiation did not produce any toxic factors in animal diets
8169867 will not lead to changes in the composition of the food that from a toxicological point of view would have an adverse effect on human health
8169868 over the last 20 year millions of mice rats and other laboratory animals have been bred and reared exclusively on an irradiated diet
8169869 no transmittable genetic defects teratogenic or oncogenic have been observed which could be attributed to the consumption of irradiated diets
8169870 we are all eating a lot of irradiated foods these days
8169871 the use of irradiation alone as a preservation technique will not solve all the problems of post harvest food losses
8169872 many countries lose huge amounts of grain because of insect infestation molds and premature germination
8169873 this will double meat shelf life provided it is kept below 5 c
8169874 the chief problem encountered in preservation of grains and grain products is insect infestation
8169875 and its use results in cleaner better quality herbs and spices compared to those fumigated with ethylene oxide
8169876 unfortunately because of widespread lack of understanding of the risks and sequelae of foodborne disease and the effectiveness and safety of irradiation food irradiation has not yet achieved widespread acceptance
8169877 we cant point to a case of anyone who has ever gotten sick from eating irradiated foods
8169878 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
8169879 this is especially important for at risk populations immune compromised folks pregnant women children under the age of eight and elderly
8169880 these people are at high risk for food borne illness and it may be useful to feed them greens that have been irradiated for that last margin of safety
8169881 irradiation can greatly reduce the incidence of all bacterial foodborne disease and save hundreds of lives each year
8169882 in 2006 there were an estimated 50 billion servings of green leafy salads served in this country and there were approximately 1 200 people made ill
8169883 the majority of serious foodborne illnesses resulting in hospitalizations and deaths 60 and 72 respectively come from bacterial pathogens
8169884 both at the national and international levels good manufacturing practices gmps govern the handling of specific foods and food products
8169885 irradiation is not a short cut that means food hygiene efforts can be relaxed
8169886 many steps need to be taken from farm to table to make sure that our food supply is clean and safe irradiation is a major step forward but it does not replace other important efforts including efforts to improve sanitation on the farm and in the food processing plant
8169887 for irradiation to be effective the food that is to be irradiated already needs to be clean
8169888 the more initial contamination there is the higher dose of irradiation it would take to eliminate possible pathogens
8169889 actually combining irradiation with increased sanitation is advantageous because less contamination means lower doses of irradiation would be needed decreasing the chance of changes in taste or smell of a product
8169890 the only significant difference was the irradiated samples being rated as more tender and juicy than the unirradiated samples
8169891 vitamin loss corresponds to that in foods that are cooked canned or held in cold storage
8169892 irradiation can reduce ascorbic acid vitamin c in some vegetables but the decrease is generally insignificant given the natural variation observed in fresh produce and does not exceed the decrease seen during storage
8169893 irradiation converts ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid both of which exhibit biological activity and are readily interconvertible
8169894 many concerns about irradiation harken back to earlier objections to pasteurization and retort canning
8169895 chemicals that are known or suspected to cause cancer and birth defects dozens of experiments dating to the 1950s have revealed a wide range of serious health problems in animals fed irradiated food
8169896 every man woman and child who takes a bite of irradiated food increases their chance of getting cancer it is no exaggeration to say that our government has turned the american people into guinea pigs
8169897 the safety of these radiolytic products has been examined very critically and no evidence of their harmfulness has ever been found
8169898 all of them had severe growth retardation edema of the lower extremities mental apathy and hypoalbuminemia levels of serum albumin being below 2 g i00 ml
8169899 viral infections and administration of cytotoxic drugs may be associated with the presence of polyploid cells its significance may perhaps not be the same as that of polyploid cells induced by the ingestion of irradiated wheat
8169900 very critical of the work of the hyderbad authors and concluded that the available data failed to demonstrate any mutagenic potential of irradiated wheat
8169901 which allegedly links the consumption of irradiated food with the occurrence of genetic events
8169902 not say anything now but we are considering everything so that the passengers the 100 passengers are protected

8169927 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8169928 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision
8169929 i dont think this should be a doomsday scenario i think common sense should prevail

8169931 dramatically escalated the crisis between russia and the rest of the world
8169932 but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
8169933 theres a lack of unity among western nations that prevents them from acting resolutely and jointly toward russian policy in the caucasus
8169934 russias influence in europe is very strong and there are nations that because of their dependence on russian energy are more vulnerable to russian pressure
