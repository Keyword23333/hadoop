5820000 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5820001 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5820002 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5820003 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into

5820005 if only i could be a time traveler id go back invest in google and have tons of money for a startup now
5820006 what can i do now that will put me in that place in four or five years
5820007 fame must be grand for barack obama but is he ready to lead in tough economic times
5820008 hey hes popular must be for a reason and so maybe ill vote for him all those other people couldnt be wrong could they
5820009 i dont know if im going to vote for mccain hes nothing but another bush term
5820010 we think that it is great that people continue to use our products in creative ways
5820011 i dont see why you didnt see it was wrong to steal 316 000 from the georgia institute of technology
5820012 she was embarrassed to have people stand up for her in court
5820013 its hard to understand how a person gets into this and continues to do this it becomes an obsession
5820014 it takes a lot of time to buy 3 800 items in 2 000 transactions
5820015 its much worse than if she wrote a single check for 316 000
5820016 id be really happy if he fulfills his promises but theres much to be done besides politics

5820024 there is no better gift for fidel on his birthday than this victory not only in the team remaining undefeated by winning this game but in the way they did it turning a setback into a victory

5820027 the significant reduction in free care through the health safety net provides further evidence that health care reform is having its intended effect
5820028 i am convinced that there must be profoundly damaging consequences for the family in a country where contraception and abortion are so wide spread
5820029 total physical self giving which is only possible for a man and a woman who have committed themselves to one another until death as husband and wife
5820030 reason why the church is so adamantly against sterilisation contraception abortion and sex outside marriage
5820031 these acts because they contradict and negate the god given meaning of the human person attack the very foundations of the human world
5820032 not purely biological but concerns the innermost being of each person
5820033 reveal the shocking depth and extent of the suffering and impoverishment of so many families and children due to the separation of the unitive and procreative nature of sexual love and the wide spread practice of pre marital sexual behaviour
5820034 no wonder so many children are suffering depression and mental illness in a country that is such a hostile environment for human life no wonder divorce is so prevalent when family life is so often characterised by a lack of generosity or self giving love
5820035 we the catholic church must be more confident and proactive in presenting our rich and fulfilling understanding of marriage sexual love and the family

5820040 i am extremely proud of the example he set in his music the spinners music was clean
5820041 what comforts me is he is one person who lived his life exactly the way he wanted to
5820042 a group of disenchanted twenty somethings assembles a strange weekly meeting seeking an outlet for their unfulfilled urges daring each other to complete a series of tasks each participant soon finds themselves going to places and lengths they never thought possible
5820043 we need to guard against turning technical and business decisions into political decisions
5820044 for me as a carrier i need to satisfy the voip customer whether its mine or someone elses is irrelevant here by delivering those packets in a timely fashion
5820045 that may mean that for economic reasons within the network to keep the cost reasonable to keep the price reasonable that i need to slow down whats not a time sensitive file
5820046 get all incensed and they accuse me of violating things i didnt even know that i could violate

5820056 theres seemingly no end to this cycle and thats to the detriment of any financial stock
5820057 home prices keep falling assets continue to deteriorate the economy continues to slow which can only worsen the unemployment rate and increase delinquencies
5820058 inflation will continue to be a concern but the real worry is still in the housing market
5820059 we will continue to have bleak data for a while
5820060 we know from the japanese example that a housing slump usually lasts for longer than economists can think of
5820061 on crude trendline support is holding and the dollar is exhausted and falling
5820062 i would like to be very clear that there is nothing that we have been able to determine that would deter would be mothers from accessing health care as they have always accessed health care with the utmost confidence

5820121 we are in favor of constructing improvements in this valley that help mitigate the congestion and some traffic issues we have
5820122 there is every reason to have the lake mead interchange there is every reason it open and there are only two reasons to delay its opening i never stated that it would never be open only to be delayed
5820123 it is going to happen but i think the sooner the better
5820124 i think the safety concerns and the sun city residents that ive heard from that would be able to enter sun city and get to shopping and other amenities will save time gas and have a safer way than going on those heavily traveled streets
5820125 this interchange is a bridge to nowhere at the present time but it will enable development and development means a lot of traffic coming down a lot of problems
5820126 we are a 55 and over retirement community we have people who dont drive anywhere except to the grocery store they dont have the reflexes of a 20 year old
5820127 what were supposed to do is whats in the public interest and in doing whats in the public interest sometimes we have to ignore some parochial interests

5820130 a oportunidade de o cruzeiro mostrar que aqui h um grupo compromissado n o importa quem jogue os titulares fazem falta mas quem entra procura dar o melhor
5820131 o adilson trabalha muito bem os atletas que n o v m atuando com o mesmo padr o dos que v m jogando quando eles entram sabem muito bem o que fazer no campo para superar as adversidades
5820132 acho que a sele o foi bem no jogo de hoje
5820133 o problema que a argentina foi muito bem na partida
5820134 a nossa equipe fala muito pouco cobra muito pouco temos que orientar mais um ao outro dentro de campo
5820135 o grupo unido n o tem a cobran a devido timidez de alguns jogadores
5820136 as pessoas est o acompanhando meus resultados isso o que mais motiva
5820137 hoje a gente tem uma estrutura suficiente para buscar qualquer medalha em qualquer competi o
5820138 em vez de buscar o melhor lugar voc tem que buscar o melhor lugar para voc onde voc tem confian a nos t cnicos nos amigos
5820139 falta viajar e competir mais com o pessoal de fora
5820140 n o adianta querer fazer as coisas s no ano da olimp ada chegar seis meses antes da olimp ada virar e perguntar para voc o que voc precisa essa medalha vai mostrar um pouquinho que precisa valorizar um pouco mais o esporte dentro do brasil e precisa de mais estrutura
5820141 vou voltar ainda hoje com meu cachorro que nada muito
5820142 estou esperando algo parecido com o que eu encontrei aqui o momento mais feliz da minha vida foi quando conquistei o ouro em pequim
5820143 estamos confiantes depois da vit ria conquistada no ltimo jogo em casa e prontos para buscar mais um resultado positivo sabemos que o advers rio dif cil mas vamos fazer o melhor
5820144 estou disposi o e espero poder ajudar o time a vencer para conquistarmos os tr s pontos
5820145 um deslize pode ser fatal ficaria muito complicado porque a retomada seria dif cil j que ficar amos longe tamb m do segundo e do terceiro colocados temos consci ncia de que esse jogo tamb m ser decisivo n o s pelo t tulo mas tamb m para retornar ao g 4
5820146 n o podemos pensar em ser primeiro agora pois ainda faltam alguns degraus primeiro temos de pensar em chegar entre os quatro mas nada est decidido ainda no come o do campeonato o flamengo teve uma diferen a parecida com essa do gr mio mas o campeonato est mostrando que dif cil se manter na ponta
5820147 temos grandes possibilidades ainda de brigar pelo t tulo e o objetivo retomar o mais r pido poss vel as vit rias
5820148 uma grande responsabilidade para mim e ao mesmo tempo um prazer enorme sei que n o vai ser f cil mas com a ajuda de todos esperamos reconquistar o cora o dos torcedores
5820149 sinto me na obriga o de ajudar a nova gera o de mostrar o caminho tenho bastante experi ncia no alto n vel mas ainda me sinto jovem de esp rito e consigo me dar bem com os mais jovens como capit o tenho de ser exemplar dentro e fora de campo preciso conversar bastante transmitir seriedade mas tamb m alegria aos novos

5820151 nossos jogadores agora s o muito jovens e fizeram muito dedicaram se e tenho que lhes dar um dez
5820152 viemos aqui para nos entregar em campo como jogador jovem os jogos significam muito para mim necess rio trabalhar muito duro para chegar at aqui mas acho que a equipe trabalhou tanto que merece estar nesta final
5820153 junto com meus companheiros vivi muitos altos e baixos e agora incr vel estar aqui em uma das maiores competi es do mundo onde posso marcar um gol e ganhar uma medalha de ouro
5820154 a nig ria tem grandes chances para ganhar o torneio pois tem muitos jogadores que podem fazer gols s o todos muito fortes e t m experi ncia

5820157 n o conhe o o jogador o assunto foi falado conosco mas n o h negocia o nem nenhuma possibilidade
5820158 muita gente tem falado com a gente sobre jogadores mas n o h nada de concreto
5820159 fa o um apelo para o torcedor o ipatinga tem nove jogos em casa e espero que o torcedor v ao campo contra o fluminense est vamos em desvantagem e na hora que ela torcida apoiou o ipatinga virou o jogo contra o internacional a torcida apoiou e vencemos o jogo contra o cruzeiro os torcedores incentivaram e conseguimos fazer 2 a 0 mas por infelicidade o cruzeiro empatou
5820160 mesmo quando o time advers rio n o est bem a torcida os empurra e eles conseguem a vit ria durante os 90 minutos a nossa torcida deve empurrar o time ao t rmino da partida se o ipatinga n o tiver vencido que vaiem mas durante o jogo o time precisa do incentivo do torcedor

5820164 fox has no financial risk here in a movie that could produce revenues for it as such i doubt that fox is going to force warner bros to shelve the movie
5820165 in all likelihood a settlement will be reached whereby warner bros gets to distribute the movie and fox gets a piece of the action
5820166 i assume fox is playing hardball to extract as much money as they can from the project but i cant imagine the movie itself would be blocked i dont know what the evidence is but it sounds like the individual producers are at the crux of the matter
5820167 the bad news is that its going to be an arduous process
5820168 the good news is that fox and warner bros have until march 2009 watchmens current release date to figure it out and come to a settlement

5820179 intentionally and wrongfully has used the fees from unreal engine 3 licenses to launch its own game to widespread commercial success while simultaneously sabotaging efforts by silicon knights and others to develop their own video games
5820180 having used ue3 to build grimm and spent considerable time in the past working with ids tools ive followed this story with amazement
5820181 to expect a licensed engine fresh out of the box would require no modification or improvements to achieve development goals on a new title is ludicrous
5820182 but to build an entirely new engine as an alternative to improving an existing one sounds a bit unreasonable and to build that new engine inside 1 year then ship a title with it now things are starting to sound surreal
5820183 my guess is that theres more than a little ue3 still in too human
5820184 progress on the silicon knights engine continues to date and at this time the silicon knights engine is completely independent of epics engine and certainly derives no benefit from the unworkable source code provided by epic
5820185 in order to fully realize the vision of apb it was essential to include next generation physics in our game world this is why we choose to standardize our development on geforce gpus and nvidia physx technology the combination of which has given our developers the power and freedom to deliver the first action and physics based combat gameplay into the massively multiplayer online space

5820195 the whole idea of being independent has its pluses and its minuses whatever it takes to make great games so with us or with valve thats just the reality of the industry
5820196 there are going to be a ton of acquisitions and mergers in the future and its going to continue until there are very few left thats probably the way its going to go
5820197 sks independence is important to a certain degree but its not the be all and end all
5820198 its funny because weve been an independent developer longer than most in the industry there are very few that have been around as long as we have i think were definitely one of the biggest independent developers in the world now
5820199 westwood used to be one of the big independent ones but theyre gone now after they were bought out by ea that was disappointing for me to see that happen i certainly never want to see that happen with us but at the end of the day we need to move towards what allows us to make great games whether that means partnering with someone permanently or not

5820276 addiction is the hallmark of every infatuation based love story it all begins when the object of your adoration bestows upon you a heady hallucinogenic dose of something you never even dared to admit that you wanted an emotional speedball perhaps of thunderous love and roiling excitement soon you start craving that intense attention with the hungry obsession of any junkie when the drug is withheld you promptly turn sick crazy and depleted not to mention resentful of the dealer who encouraged this addiction in the first place but who now refuses to pony up the good stuff anymore despite the fact that you know he has it hidden somewhere goddamn it because he used to give it to you for free next stage finds you skinny and shaking in a corner certain only that you would sell your soul or rob your neighbors just to have that thing even one more time meanwhile the object of your adoration has now become repulsed by you he looks at you like youre someone hes never met before much less someone he once loved with high passion the irony is you can hardly blame him youre a pathetic mess unrecognizable even to your own eyes so thats it you have now reached infatuations final destination the complete and merciless devaluation of self

5820306 the artist cannot and has no right too lower himself to some abstract standardised level for the sake of a misconstrued notion of greater accessibility and understanding if he did it could only lead to the decline of art and we expect art to flourish we believe that the artist still has untapped resources to discover and at the same time we believe that audiences will make ever more serious demands at any rate that is what we want to believe marx said if you want to enjoy art you must be artistically educated the artist cannot make a specific aim of being understandable it would be quite as absurd as its opposite trying to be incomprehensible the artist his product and his public are an indivisible entity like a single organism linked by the same bloodstream if conflict occurs between the parts of the organism then it requires expert treatment and careful handling nothing could be more deleterious in its effect than the leveling down of commercial cinema for the production line standards of television these corrupt the public to an unforgivable degree denying them the experience of true art
5820307 a director cannot be equally well understood by everyone but is entitled to his own more or less numerous following among cinema goers this is the normal condition of existence for an individual artist and of the evolution of cultural tradition in society of course each of us wants to find the maximum number of kindred spirits who will appreciate and need us but we cannot calculate our own success and we are powerless to select our working principles in such a way as to ensure it as soon as one begins to cater expressly for the auditorium then were talking of the entertainment industry show business the masses or what have you but certainly not of art which necessarily obeys its own immanent laws of development whether we like it or not

5820343 observational studies have demonstrated that the concentration of total homocysteine in blood is associated with risk of coronary artery disease and stroke
5820344 to evaluate the effects of homocysteine lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin b12 on mortality and cardiovascular events
5820345 mean average plasma total homocysteine concentration was reduced by 30 percent after 1 year of treatment in the groups receiving folic acid and vitamin b12
5820346 during a median midpoint 38 months of follow up the primary end point was experienced by a total of 422 participants 13 7 percent 219 participants 14 2 percent receiving folic acid vitamin b12 vs 203 13 1 percent not receiving such treatment and 200 participants 13 0 percent receiving vitamin b6 vs 222 14 3 percent not receiving vitamin b6
5820347 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events among patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing intensive conventional treatment we found a numerically lower incidence of stroke and higher incidence of cancer in the groups receiving folic acid but these observations were not statistically significant
5820348 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
5820349 prevention strategies often focus on modifiable risk factors for colonization and aspiration and can successfully reduce ventilator associated pneumonia rates but no single strategy completely eliminates ventilator associated pneumonia
5820350 adherence to prevention guidelines is variable due to costs and lack of education resources and leadership
5820351 in conclusion the results of this large randomized multicenter study demonstrated that the silver coated endotracheal tube significantly reduced the incidence of microbiologically confirmed ventilator associated pneumonia and had its greatest benefit during the peak time of ventilator associated pneumonia occurrence without any notable adverse events
5820352 the silver coated endotracheal tube appears to offer a unique approach because it is the first intervention that becomes user dependent after intubation requiring no further action by the clinician
5820353 based on the results of this trial should clinicians reconsider guidelines for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and use a silver coated endotracheal tube in all patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation in the icu
5820354 the answer is probably yes for the subset of patients at very high risk of developing early onset ventilator associated pneumonia such as neurologically impaired patients or trauma patients because the greatest effect of the intervention appeared to occur during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation and was clinically relevant with minimal effect on clinician workload
5820355 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit of silver coated endotracheal tubes
5820356 consequently silver coated tubes should not be viewed as the definitive answer for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and until additional data confirm the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of these devices their issue should be restricted to high risk patients treated in icus with benchmark value based infection rates that remain above institutional goals despite implementation of a comprehensive strategy of usual preventive measures to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia
5820357 the potential role of arsenic in diabetes development is supported by experimental and mechanistic evidence
5820358 from a public health perspective confirmation of a role for arsenic in diabetes development would add to the concerns posed by the carcinogenic cardiovascular developmental and reproductive effects of inorganic arsenic in drinking water and could substantially modify risk assessment and risk benefit analyses estimating the consequences of arsenic exposure
5820359 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
5820360 stemming the pandemic of type 2 diabetes is a public health priority and will require a multifaceted approach
5820361 this must include improving the understanding of the etiology of diabetes and identifying modifiable factors that can be incorporated into prevention strategies
5820362 to date this approach has focused on medication and lifestyle modification but the role of environmental exposures must also be considered
5820363 while many questions remain about the role of arsenic in diabetogenesis they can only be answered by additional research
5820364 in the meantime arsenic exposure from drinking water is a widespread environmental pollutant that affects millions of individuals around the world
5820365 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched
5820366 vap is a relatively common infection and increasingly one caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria
5820367 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
5820368 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology
5820369 the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body
5820370 developing strategies to improve the prediction and diagnoses of dementia has paramount therapeutic and public health implications
5820371 when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy normative samples to determine cognitive impairment however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5820372 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of incident dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period mean average 3 3 years
5820373 on the basis of the consensus clinical diagnostic procedures 47 participants developed incident dementia of the alzheimer type and 18 participants developed incident vascular dementia during the study 128 individuals died as expected for the age of this cohort of these 18 had developed incident dementia
5820374 in summary within person across neuropsychological test variability was associated with development of dementia independently of performance of the neuropsychological tests this finding needs to be replicated in different populations before it is applied in a clinical setting
5820375 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes
5820376 while prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal these findings add to the existing concerns about the long term health consequences of low and moderate exposure to inorganic arsenic

5820398 goedenavond u spreekt met nuvema uitvaarverzekeringen u heeft bij ons een polis lopen en nu hebben wij u enige tijd geleden een brief verzonden met zeer belangrijke informatie
5820399 oke ik kan het me zo niet herinneren maar wanneer heeft u die verstuurd
5820400 zon enige weken geleden en deze brief bevatte informatie over de mogelijkheid om uw gedenkteken tegen een zeer aantrekkelijke prijs mee te verzekeren in uw polis
5820401 oke tja er begint me wel iets te dagen maar waarschijnlijk heb ik hem tja ehh weggegooid zou u hem misschien nog een keer kunnen sturen
5820402 nou kijk mevrouw wat in die brief staat heb ik u net verteld en omdat het nogal belangrijke zaken zijn bespreken wij die liever persoonlijk met u
5820403 dus ik zou zeggen wanneer schikt het u op een middag of een avond
5820404 goed laten we zeggen 15 april om 19 00 uur
5820405 goed mevrouw mag ik u dan bedanken voor uw tijd en dan kunt u n van onze consulentes verwachten op dinsdagavond 15 april om 19 00 uur
5820406 they saw i was disgruntled they saw that me sitting to the side and watching and we know it wasnt going to work out well for either of us
5820407 we made the right decision they allowed me to go and im just happy to know that im leaving with good character
5820408 i talked to smitty coach mike smith and i talked to general manager thomas dimitroff we shook hands and we wished each other the best
5820409 its a business so i understand how things were handled
5820410 what if some of their receivers went down they would have had me around to help i knew that and understood
5820411 if i couldnt play i would retire but i know i can still play
5820412 if you have this feeling of yourself as not being worthy perhaps you dont really care about yourself you dont care about your health and so you might not use a condom
5820413 theres a deep linkage in the minds of some gay people that if youre gay youll inevitably get hiv
5820414 where i grew up i always heard gay is wrong and all gays have hiv
5820415 i figured he was somewhat of a new person who hadnt been around the block
5820416 i never felt like i was superman i just felt like i could outsmart the system
5820417 i always felt like it definitely could happen to me but i thought i could figure out a certain method of how it was dispersed by people
5820418 its definitely something i was not expecting especially this early in my life
5820419 the study found that hiv diagnosis among young females declined steadily from 1994 2003 in every racial ethnic and age group
5820420 among young males however an initial decline was offset by significant increases in more recent years driven primarily by increases among young adult ages 20 24 men who have sex with men
5820421 indicate that teens are making more responsible decisions about sex
5820422 a lot of my partners are not thinking about condoms
5820423 i think im usually the first one to bring condom use up in sexual situations sometimes my partners know my status and sometimes they dont they just want to jump in the bed
5820424 at that time i was the dumbest thing walking i thought i was invincible and could do whatever and not get ill
5820425 i thought i was in this relationship with this man who loved me why do we need to wear condoms
5820426 they may not do it consciously but unconsciously youre going out looking for some validation
5820427 were so broken apart because of society and its taken a lot of validation away
5820428 unless we give each generation the message with the same kind of passion intensity and updatedness youth are not going to get it theyre not going to believe its for them
5820429 we cant isolate one factor that causes unsafe sex and so our approaches have to be multi factoral
5820430 if condoms are just in the public health sphere and not in the real world sphere why should young people think condoms are for them
5820431 of course the distribution of condoms i guess goes against what the department policy says
5820432 during our sex education they no 1 never talked about gay sex and no 2 they never talked about having sex and using condoms
5820433 kids who self identify as gay and who are out and know that do need interventions that are specific to them
5820434 if a young person can deliver their story to young people and say this is what its like dealing with this disease yes i may look healthy but this is what i deal with that in itself is a powerful prevention tool
5820435 since 2001 the under 30 gay crowd has shown a 33 climb in
5820436 i think the last rubber gay guys used in this town was in 1985
5820437 to use a condom every time you have sex for the rest of your life
5820438 thats a very very big burden thats a lot to ask of somebody and its not being asked of anybody other than gay men
5820439 when i have sex with someone who is hiv positive i feel a lot more free
5820440 i just prefer sex without a condom on they feel so clinical
5820441 once again novak has demonstrated his callous disregard for the rights of others as well as his chronic inability to accept responsibility for his actions
5820442 we have long argued that responsible adults should take novaks typewriter away the time has arrived for them to also take away the keys to his
5820443 the only thing different about me is that i cant breast feed my baby but a lot of mothers dont
5820444 ill be arrested the minute i land on the shore of course but i have a gun so be warned

5820446 its something i should have done a long time ago and now i can file it away
5820447 if he doesnt get his way he throws a temper tantrum like a 5 year old does he like stomps the floor and yells meehhhh and starts throwing stuff around
5820448 but they didnt raise the flag the story is the famous flag raising picture and they didnt do that
5820449 the man is not my father and were not on a plantation
5820450 i didnt personally attack him he sounds like an angry old man right there
5820451 it is incorrect she must have had about 30 babies by now its the silly season as far as were concerned its another rumor out of london
5820452 its two girls at a sleepover and if all of a sudden thats bad then what is the world coming to
5820453 it is indeed an honor to have lindsay lohan at capri hollywood
5820454 we are delighted to recognize her talent as a performing artist as well as her position as an icon in the world of entertainment
5820455 what a jerk you are youre supposed to be a father
5820456 was it helpful to the situation regrettably no i definitely think if i had it to do over again i probably wouldnt make any statement at all period
5820457 she can call me and come live in our house with us for a couple of months i would help set her straight
5820458 these are issues of confinement very serious confinement not allowed to contact her friends not allowed to use the phone not allowed to come and go as you please
5820459 anyone whos under a conservatorship can argue that theyve lost their civil rights
5820460 thats what a conservatorship does it takes away some of your rights
5820461 to have my honesty impugned has never happened in my life
5820462 in evaluating the circumstances of the last few days a amp e has decided to take dog the bounty hunter off the networks schedule for the foreseeable future
5820463 we hope that mr chapman continues the healing process that he has begun
5820464 as a matter of public policy we are building more prisons we have more cells than we have schoolrooms
5820465 what are we telling our young generations to come we cant give you an after school program we cant give you this we cant give you that but we can give you 25 to life
5820466 may have been holiday related in terms of setting up things and tripping
5820467 shes the best thing in my life and i have never been happier
5820468 though soft spoken and laid back he likes to talk to fans and get to know them while signing
5820469 plato said in the republic that the ideal age for occupying ruling positions is after 55 in my opinion that ideal age should be 60 and i imagine that 60 in platos day would be somewhere around 80 today
5820470 we are all exceedingly proud and grateful for this extraordinary commitment
5820471 if you have an addictive personality like lindsay you need that to replace the highs you got from taking drugs all the time sex became a key part of her recovery
5820472 did not consume an alcoholic beverage or any type of medication or drug
5820473 admitted that as a 17 year old he volunteered to join the
5820474 what is missing is a clear and simple statement i did not volunteer to join the waffen ss
5820475 like her father henry viii she was incredibly conscious of how important her image was
5820476 this painting is so pretty and decorative and the symbolism alludes to the fact that she is in the ripeness of her life
5820477 people to tote around her big old fashioned printed on paper books as if they were the hottest new entertainment devices on the planet
5820478 when you win a game you riot when you lose a game you riot when spring comes you riot african american heritage festival weekend you riot
5820479 i have not seen or spoken to my daughter since early june and i have no prospect of speaking to her anytime soon due to whitneys actions
5820480 everybodys happy when they win something whether youre a congressman or a staffer
5820481 it is a personal matter and it is unfortunate that this has become public
5820482 everyone should be aware of whats going on in their town and the council isnt going out of their way to let the residents know
5820483 sometimes people cant make it to the meetings but theyd still like to know what is going on thats where we step in
5820484 there are people who need to know various agendas and items of interest and now its a step closer to them and on their time schedule
5820485 we have an excellent international network of agencies funded by our local federation annual fundraising campaigns jdc and jafi evacuated 200 jews from the city of gori and located almost all known jews in the conflict zone almost immediately they provided medical care to jewish casualties food medicine and clothing to others and are bringing jews to israel on aliyah
5820486 ironically as jafi considered a 45 million budget cut its tbilisi office was a candidate for closing
5820487 we dont know when the next crisis will arise but we do know that if we maintain a strong international network of agencies funded by our annual campaign we will always find and assist jews in need wherever they might be
5820488 when you come to a leaked deerhunter album on the internet take it
5820489 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
5820490 despite the macroeconomic conditions we saw improved execution in our merchandising and operations initiatives during the past quarter
5820491 even though ruth measures barely five feet in height shes very tall in the willing to serve department
5820492 i use ruth often as an example of using our gifts for christs glory and not retiring from that service as long as we are able she remains faithful flexible and fun as she willingly guides us in worship on sunday mornings at weddings and at funerals
5820493 i had some alcohol in me i just reacted it wasnt supposed to happen
5820494 i pulled her up into the old bus she just dropped where she was she was going oh my head i just left her there
5820495 i think it might sort of reflect partly that we havent released all our policies yet so they dont know what the tax policy looks like and all those sort of things at this point and obviously we are working our way pretty quickly now through those
5820496 if the public cant trust you and you dont keep your word in office you wont last there i want to lead national to victory but also want to lead national in government for a long period of time
5820497 keep our word and our bond with the new zealand public
5820498 i dont think they understand actually whats happening here in terms of what we are proposing
5820499 were talking about having it at the most at 22 percent a very low level
5820500 we need to build infrastructure if we want to grow without inflation to deliver higher wages to deliver a really bright future we need that infrastructure
5820501 its not so much an apology im making more an explanation to you for the anger
5820502 today we are celebrating the start of a new era for our fabulous ford motor company the first product of our global product development system the all new fiesta is an outstanding symbol for our one ford vision of a single global company designing and building cars for customers around the world be proud of what you have achieved and be proud of your contribution to a model that will get the world talking
5820503 the ford fiesta is very special to us in ford of europe and to our customers
5820504 over the past 32 years it has consistently been at the top of the list of europes best selling cars
5820505 its dynamic bold design and high manufacturing quality will attract a new generation of fiesta owners and appeal to existing customers i am confident that the all new fiesta will build on the success of its predecessor
5820506 were very proud of the cologne assembly plant and the vehicles produced here not only does the new fiesta bring innovative design and engineering to the small car market but it brings new manufacturing technologies as well
5820507 this new fiesta is tough strong and safe due to the body construction technologies which allow us to build a lightweight yet extremely strong body through the innovated use of high strength steel it is also built with care craftsmanship and precision by an efficient and dedicated workforce which is second to none
5820508 we had to leave quickly president bush and his wife his father and his wife and his brother and his wife were arriving at the hotel from bangkok we were told our time in the hotel was over and so we left
5820509 it took a lot of negotiating to get it released
5820510 we took the decision in the interest of the player
5820511 we want him and bryan to recover fully so that they will be available for our final tri nations test
5820512 he put the all blacks under pressure in the lineout and he is a brilliant player with the ball in hand
5820513 we know daniel carter is the best tactical kicker in the world
5820514 therefore we wanted to slow down the game at the back last week
5820515 this week we want to speed it up the wallabies are fast but they do not have kickers of the same calibre
5820516 the passing of president mwanawasa is a great loss not only to the people of zambia but also to the southern african region and the entire african continent
5820517 ping expresses his condolences to the family of the late president and to the people of zambia and expresses his solidarity and that of the african people to the people of zambia during this difficult period
5820518 africa will remember mwanawasa for his role in resolving african conflicts particularly when he was chairperson of the southern african development community
5820519 people of zambia and africa as a whole have lost an eminent leader
5820520 his struggle for justice and the economic well being of his people will be an enduring chapter in the history of zambia
5820521 cuban americans finally see themselves as part of the wider u s a and they care about other issues
5820522 have kept cuban families separated but havent put a dent in the cuban regime
5820523 bush succeeded in dividing what was once a monolithic vote for his party
5820524 ive just found this picture on the net and i need to make up lies in order to display it
5820525 he was frosty at first he felt betrayed when she dumped him for his friend lance but after a while he caved in and has been sweet to her
5820526 it came up when i was eight months pregnant when i was beached like a whale
5820527 i was watching tv and i saw a triathlon and i said i think i could do that maybe we could raise some money and do something really great
5820528 lo sputo non uno strumento legittimo di critica e dissenso ma esprime solo disprezzo nei confronti della vittima
5820529 i am concerned about the announced release date of april 2010 neither robert nor i were consulted about this and we are both concerned about how realistic the date is in light of the fact that we have no script story or even writers hired yet this genre of movie is best when it is done thoughtfully and with plenty of preparation it might be better to follow the bb dk batman begins the dark knight x x2 three year release pattern than to scramble for a date it is difficult because there are no marvel 09 releases and they need product but i also think we owe it to the fans to have a great version of im2 and at this point we would have less time to make it than the first one
5820530 dark grim haunting and inventive dark knight is nothing short of brilliant representing chris nolans most accomplished and mature work to date and the best and scariest comic hero adaptation youre likely to see this summer perhaps the whole year
5820531 warner bros pictures the dark knight is not only the best film i have seen this year but quite possibly the best superhero movie ever made
5820532 the haunting and visionary dark knight soars on the wings of untamed imagination
5820533 its full of surprises you dont see coming and just try to get it out of your dreams
5820534 martin scorseses the departed michael manns heat brian de palmas the untouchables and now christopher nolans the dark knight can join the ranks as one of the best crime dramas in modern movie history
5820535 im sorry to disappoint them but that is not possible
5820536 ive just found this picture on the net and i need to make up lies in order to display it
5820537 if interest gets really hooked by something they will read any and everything that is relevant so skateboarding bmx wildlife dinosaurs and football come up as choices
5820538 i can tell you that basically when you look at two face you should get sick to your stomach
5820539 being the guy under all that well that was a lot of fun for me its like you would feel if you met someone whose face had pretty much been ripped off or burned off with acid i cant talk about it beyond that because i dont want to give away too much of the plans by chris nolan
5820540 there are fans on the internet who have done artists versions of what they think it will look like and i can tell you this theyre thinking small chris is going way farther than people think
5820541 the difference between batman and two face is how far they are willing to go and how they make their point otherwise were talking about vigilante crime fighting thats what batman is all about he has a strong sense of justice and harvey dent has an extremely strong sense of justice his fianc e is killed hes horribly injured but he is still true to himself hes a crime fighter hes not killing good people hes not a bad guy not purely
5820542 in memory of our friends heath ledger amp conway wickliffe
5820543 i needed a phenomenal actor but he also had to be someone unafraid of taking on such an iconic role heath created something entirely original its stunning its captivating its going to blow people away
5820544 batman es al pacino y el joker robert de niro
5820545 why is that this guy is a moron this gal is a moron hes a moron shes a moron the people at gym are morons your dispatcher is a moron people on the news are morons morons run this country everywhere you turn you seem to be surrounded by morons
5820546 well yeah i am i am surrounded by morons you have to admit there is a lot of them out there
5820547 that may be but you seem to run into more than your share
5820548 do you think thats what a rhino thinks when hes out in the wild you know when he sees people looking at him staring from their safari jeep do you think he looks over and says what are those morons looking at
5820549 whereas if they had had any wisdom they would have repelled that motive earlier since
5820550 im sorry to disappoint them but that is not possible
5820551 ive just found this picture on the net and i need to make up lies in order to display it
5820552 well that was a good end to the day wasnt it
5820553 without a reorganization plan in place soon the company could face severe consequences and these same institutions will likely recover far less than under the ripplewood proposal
5820554 we are holding out little hope that this proposal will be approved
5820555 these banks and hedge funds are once again going to disappoint all of the 23 000 employees of interstate just like they have disappointed the nation with the mortgage debacle
5820556 were hopeful that the parties will reach agreement on concessions that would allow ibc to emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a stand alone company
5820557 its just internet conversation its nothing true im afraid ive not been contacted by anybody to do with the hobbit id be interested in reading the script if when they write it but thats a long way away i think but beyond that you cant make any decisions
5820558 una naci n adentro de una naci n con su propio lenguaje estado de nimo y moneda una econom a construida alrededor de las millas gratis que yo he llegado a apreciar m s que los d lares la inflaci n no las degrada no pagan impuestos las millas gratis son propiedad privada en su m s pura expresi n

5820560 una mujer que llegar demasiado lejos al interpretar un papel
5820561 i was hoping to forge a bipartisan solution that would offer consumers more diversity in programming better price protection greater choices among innovative devices and real competition with digital radio
5820562 instead it appears theyre going to get a monopoly with window dressing
5820563 by golly your job is to hold their feet to the fire what have they been doing
5820564 instead the question being asked is what will a majority of the fcc vote for
5820565 and the fcc seems to be willing to approve a merger to monopoly once again demonstrating that the lobbying dollar goes a long way in washington
5820566 weve got to find a way to come up with legislation in richmond to prevent this kind of stuff from happening
5820567 our objective is to make these upgrades as unobtrusive as possible for the community and for the residents who are living there
5820568 and where were not doing that we work hard to make that right
5820569 it has to be an intentional ongoing deliberate practice when it happens the company has always been responsive
5820570 until we have a pattern of complaints that shows this has become a practice and not just a spot occurrence then we cant determine whether or not there has been willful violation
5820571 its about redirecting the guidance counselors to more important tasks and its about the quality of data
5820572 the potential is huge for this technology once it is fully implemented
5820573 will significantly improve the evaluation that we are now doing by hand and speed up the process in order to spend more time evaluating other parts of the application a student is presenting
5820574 its a huge advantage to students in terms of timing
5820575 its really a question of staying the course and surviving
5820576 the venture industry is operating under the same long term philosophy it has adhered to historically venture firms are prepared to invest for 5 to 10 years and will stick with their companies through difficult times
5820577 yep the way its looking we might actually win this thing
5820578 its not a question of who needs whom fact is the netroots are not going to be the decisive factor
5820579 but having said that were an activist set of people were engaged we give money we put boots on the ground thats why when many of us had a genuine disagreement with obama on fisa
5820580 folks in the convention have to keep in mind that not everyone who considers themselves a part of the netroots is here and many of them arent as concerned about say fisa or impeachment they want jobs
5820581 according to the storyline that drives many advocacy groups and democratic activists a storyline often reflected in comments on this blog we are up against a sharply partisan radically conservative take no prisoners republican party
5820582 changed the trajectory of america in a way that bill clinton did not
5820583 democracy cannot exist without strong differences and going forward some of you may decide that my fisa position is a deal breaker
5820584 think about it netroots was born at a time when the democrats were in opposition and its learning how to be a force of good when the democrats are in power and could have more power next year
5820585 crashing the gate netroots grassroots and the rise of people powered politics
5820586 for most everyone in the netroots the main goal right now is get obama elected period now how the netroots and obama move forward after november if he is elected is another issue
5820587 weve had some disagreements in the past and well have some disagreements in the future
5820588 i promise to continue to listen to your concerns take them seriously and discuss them respectfully
5820589 ive been waiting to see just how much hes going to involve the netroots in the way he thinks about policies
5820590 la huella militar ocupa buena parte de nuestro legado siendo de gran trascendencia para nuestra ciudad y sus gentes todo lo relacionado con el ej rcito construcciones como el arsenal militar hospital militar castillos y fortalezas que bordean la bah a de cartagena todo un despliegue arquitect nico para la defensa de la ciudad
5820591 yeah i dont like watching women play basketball the players look clumsy and frumpy
5820592 yes blah blah blah patriarchal society blah blah blah hegemony blah blah blah disenfranchisment blah blah blah marginalization of blah blah blah
5820593 for me its a matter of preference men look good playing basketball or football or rugby women look good when doing gymnastics or diving or doing anything that brings our their grace both men and women look great playing volleyball neither look good playing field hockey i dont want to see women play basketball and i dont want to see men figure skating but ill watch anything if the usa has a chance at gold
5820594 its possible that i need to reevaluate my preferences and undo sexist programming ill work on that during football season which is only three weeks away
5820595 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma

5820600 we see some guys doing some good things and were also going to play some three down players on the line but thats one issue thats yet to be resolved however there are some guys close
5820601 hes definitely our starter with 10 or 11 days to solidify that hes been our most consistent tackle if we were playing tomorrow marsh would be our starting nose guard
5820602 patchan is the only guy who hasnt practiced yet and he was our starter coming out of spring ball i think weve been real smart about his rehab
5820603 were basing a lot of it on what hes doing in the weight room hes getting his strength back id much rather be a little conservative right now bringing him back and having him for the season instead of bringing him back too soon and losing him for six to eight weeks hes staying in great shape and hes working out
5820604 they say hes going to come out to practice when school starts monday thats almost a miracle he had a severe issue with his back but i guess hes going to come out next week i hope he can be a factor
5820605 you go in with another linebacker or another nickel back
5820606 it looks like well be in a 3 3 5 we see a lot of one back teams when you see two backs and a tight end well be in sure four down but well play some three down
5820607 matching personnel nowadays with three down linemen is something thats really good
5820608 i think charlie strong has put together a great package
5820609 weve all talked about it and had a little input but its charlies deal our three down package i think is really good its complex and we can do a lot of things out of it
5820610 cunningham was a solid player last year jermaine cunningham needs to be more than solid
5820611 im not buying solid in 2008 i dont think he is either my expectations are that he is a lot better than solid and average he needs to be a better player he needs to make more game changing plays
5820612 weve already made the decision were going to play him hell be on special teams and hell help us at end because of his quickness his speed and his effort weve got to play him this year
5820613 repruebo totalmente la visi n esa de que reprobaron ya que a los ni os no los podemos llamar reprobados a veces los chavos en cierta rea no saben bien y es nuestro deber como sistema educativo prepararlos para que salgan bien porque quiere decir que el m todo no estuvo bien
5820614 podamos conservar una buena relaci n para cumplir con el pa s y con el presidente del mandato que se nos ha dado por elevar la calidad educativa
5820615 viniendo de un pasado m xico americano es bueno porque no muchos americanos logran hacer algo como esto
5820616 siento que estoy viviendo el sue o americano estados unidos es la tierra de las oportunidades y yo estoy contento de representarla
5820617 esto es lo que dije que iba a hacer me puse mi meta y entren duro s lo junt las piezas y realmente cre en mi mismo y lo hice
5820618 im looking forward to getting back playing in the scottish premier league
5820619 ive always enjoyed my spells in scotland and havent done too badly europe is also massive for us if we win one tie well be in the group stage and could play against some massive clubs so im really looking forward to that
5820620 is insanity its disgraceful if ive got something of scientific value that i cant share because of imaginary privacy concerns its crazy thats how we solve crimes
5820621 if practiced routinely we would be subjecting hundreds of thousands of innocent people who happen to be relatives of individuals in the fbi database to lifelong genetic surveillance
5820622 the fbi would be more comfortable with congressional authorization to conduct familial searches
5820623 right now theres no way that law enforcement can keep up with all this activity
5820624 the t stands for temporary h is housing e is emergency
5820625 they want us to take technology from the future and make it real
5820626 they give it to you in a backpack size and you let it out of the backpack then its a crumpled up mess on the ground like a moon bounce before it gets air in it
5820627 its like expanding foam you just put a little bit in and it gets really big
5820628 m xico ocupa el primer lugar de secuestros en el mundo y adem s hay una crueldad creciente en varias de las bandas de secuestradores el asesinato de mart por ser un ni o desencadena una reacci n pero el descontento generalizado ya exist a por la impunidad
5820629 el contenido de la estrategia nacional contra el secuestro y la seguridad ser n de com n acuerdo
5820630 no caer en la provocaci n de quienes quieren lucrar pol ticamente
5820631 they are a continuation of the actions taken through many generations of work to make us one of the strongest states in the union
5820632 i dont think were doing quite well on our own
5820633 we are known for being pioneers in biotech but the resources to make those companies succeed havent been strong
5820634 the center will unveil the entire pathway to the marketplace
5820635 vast opportunities that exist with this field which is expected to permeate all technology industries in the years ahead
5820636 the system was not set up to track those things that was a result of a decision made by people not to include it
5820637 los candidatos fomentaron la especulaci n con gestos pistas y gui os para obtener la mayor visibilidad posible antes del anuncio
5820638 estoy orgulloso de sumarme a mi amigo el senador joe biden en el pedido de 1 000 millones de d lares adicionales en asistencia de reconstrucci n para el pueblo de georgia
5820639 si mal no recuerdo el vicepresidente no es una voz independiente refleja la posici n del presidente de estados unidos
5820640 si uno no tiene la voluntad o la capacidad de hacer eso entonces creo que deber a dejarle el puesto a otro
5820641 today we carry out congresss unambiguous mandate to protect consumer privacy
5820642 fcc commissioners regularly champion consumer choice transparency of information and competition on a level playing field but this decision creates less of each
5820643 after todays ruling verizon will have additional incentive to focus on making sure that all its customers are happy with their service rather than reserving the red carpet treatment for those who have already decided to leave but whose transfer has not yet been technically implemented
5820644 i am therefore disappointed that the commission would prohibit these practices which promote and benefit consumers and particularly disappointed that they would do so and prohibit practices from only one class of companies
5820645 moreover the cable companies engage in such practices to keep their video customers from switching to other providers
5820646 we couldnt connect to the outside world without the power and the internet
5820647 ok folks black bloggers to the back of the bus
5820648 jim crow raises his ugly head at the democratic convention
5820649 national politics to niche issues of interest to specific communities
5820650 there is nothing democratic about an all white democratic national convention floor blogging corps
5820651 this is all very puzzling to me and to a lot of black bloggers
5820652 the democratic national committee says it wants to be inclusive it wants to have a big tent and then this what were they thinking
5820653 the added value of being true as henry kissinger once said about another matter
5820654 the good rain across time and terrain in the pacific northwest
5820655 when you think of vocational education you think of wood shop

5820660 over the past couple of years ive been fascinated with the concept of news and information as being the new rock and roll
5820661 there had always been music but rock and roll took it to a whole new level broke the rules wrote a whole new playbook
5820662 lee is the most formidable creative thinker in the media business today

5820703 ngai theres been a lot of discussion online about the business model of the game going back to the genesis of hellgate london at what point did you know that you wanted to go with a sort of hybrid model a base game that would have standard pc game retail pricing and then an optional premium subscription model on top of it as well bill roper weve actually since the beginning known that we wanted to do a tiered format it was very very important for us to be able to come up with a way to actually provide even more of an experience than we did with diablo 2 with hellgate london basically we noticed people had a lot of expectations from the team because of what we did with the diablo series part of that was the ability to when they got the game having that single player experience and then being able to take that and go online and have that experience for free i wanted to make sure we had that because that was the base level expectation of our fans thats what they got from diablo 2

5820902 research by donald feener at the university of utah has shown that the flies actually have a very low success rate at killing the ants because the ants are so good at hiding they spend so much time in hiding however that the whole ant population becomes weaker

5820904 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes

5820914 supporters of himes questioned why the media this newspaper in particular would give whitnum a forum to speak her mind and make her ideas known
5820915 the newspapers role in this and in so many parts of the democratic process was to report the truth and let the people decide
5820916 this request is wholly consistent with the pastoral actions and public statements made by the pope toward victims of childhood sexual abuse
5820917 the holy fathers leadership is essential to bringing peace both to the church and to the souls of those suffering as a result of the scourge of abuse

5820923 even in the worst years new line always had that party
5820924 senior management didnt want to be disrespectful of the circumstances were still mourning the hurt and difficulties of so many of our former colleagues but toby felt like the summer party is part of new lines dna and to change that is a mistake
5820925 these three summer movies made this the highest grossing summer in new line history including 2005s wedding crashers
5820926 but a lot of it was due to warner bros which reinvented the campaigns with new one sheets and tv spots and trailers and outdoor journey was promoed with every single print of wall e s opening weekend a cynical person could have said that warner didnt have to do that because it had nothing at stake but warner bros treated those movies like they were their own

5820932 i dont think they should be subject to that kind of political debate
5820933 its a stretch im not sure if were ever going to get that
5820934 but its a goal to fight for it sends a message that you care about vets
5820935 we agree with the sentiment but the practicality is a question
5820936 with our nations middle class struggling economically we can ill afford al franken style government programs where there is no budget no way to pay for it and no ability to deliver on it

5820964 but most real networks are dynamic network links go up and down and thus some nodes need to recalculate their routes in response
5820965 is to tell everyone flood the topology change throughout the network and have each node re compute its table of best routes but that requirement to universally communicate and to act on each change is a big problem
5820966 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet
5820967 our routing algorithm reduces the overhead of route re computation after a network change making it possible to support larger networks the benefits are especially significant when networks are made up of low power devices of slow links
5820968 is in how information about changes in the network is propagated the xl routing algorithm propagates only some updates reducing the number of updates sent through the network
5820969 the rules ensure that selected routes are nearly as good as if complete information about the network were available
5820970 but at a fraction of the overhead required for maintaining such a state of perfect knowledge
5820971 air pollution control technology has improved so much in the past 29 years that compliance now should be easier not harder

5820977 since these estimates have a small margin of error are leading indicators of future housing activity and are not influenced by weather nearly as much as starts
5820978 but they also hint at a possible rebound late this year
5820979 starts will continue to fall through the end of the year likely hitting a 50 year low
5820980 the good news is that the lower construction will soon cut into the mountain of inventory weighing on the housing market
5820981 this is a necessary condition for housing to bottom and the recession to end
5820982 the real issue is not what the one month low will be but when will activity simply stabilize
5820983 in the past once the low had been reached and the rebound occurred construction slowly but steadily improved
5820984 but the fed needs to see that improvement before the members can feel that the housing related issues facing the financial sector are done

5821000 the only word they could say in english was accident
5821001 there were 10 or 15 of them with blood pouring from wounds to their heads arms and bodies it was a shocking sight
5821002 the accident occurred in a very difficult area to access with the coach ending up on its side down a steep embankment which hampered rescue attempts

5821007 they started in los angeles and flourished there for a reason
5821008 because l a is all about image and hype and being seen being seen doing things that are cool people see a photo of paris eating pinkberry and they want it
5821009 the question is are you going to just be a niche player or will you be a national chain
5821010 they clearly are getting a nice buzz within the population but we often mistake our willingness to try new things as a trend
5821011 were not out there trying to get people to endorse pinkberry
5821012 it has been a natural phenomenon were focused on building the right infrastructure growing in other regions and building a fantastic company
5821013 theres always a window of opportunity they are hot for a couple years and die down everything is cyclical

5821018 during the race i told myself boy be greedy its champagne or fizzy water
5821019 i think he has been quite an effective governor in many areas but at this point in time it is hard to see how he would bring strength to the ticket in the national security area which i think the american public will be looking for in this election
5821020 but it may well be that his achievements as governor which i think are considerable and the high regard in the state for him could offset that
5821021 but it would seem to me obama would be well advised to look at national security and foreign affairs
5821022 you would have to concede that having a governor from virginia running on the ticket would be of some help to obama in virginia
5821023 these are traditional voters who tend to favor moderate republican candidates and not ultra conservative republican candidates and i think senator mccain is the type of republican who does very very well out there
5821024 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
5821025 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
5821026 americas future depends on the health of our country the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs our analysis shows that we are not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
5821027 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority

5821039 the worst thing the world could do would be to compromise and show weakness

5821080 thats disturbing for moms trying to raise girls with a sense of themselves and whats appropriate
5821081 weve seen a lot of crossover shows things originally developed for cable are appearing on broadcast tv or being promoted on broadcast tv
5821082 you cant possibly know about all the shows unless youve got nothing going on in your life and you just watch tv with your kids 24 7
5821083 theres a big step between not appropriate for little kids and it fits the definition of indecency
5821084 television is a pig with a ring in its nose

5821118 were doing systematic observations now to determine if theres something that may trigger it but so far we havent found anything
5821119 this indicates that they do learn from each other which is not a surprise really but it does also seem that they exhibit elements of what in humans we would call cultural behaviour

5821235 we need a lot more than drilling to get us out of this mess

5821399 this is a clear violation of the fundamental rights of individuals to live and practice their faith
5821400 forcing doctors to have to choose between being a doctor and being a christian in the state of california is an outrageous violation of the fundamental rights of every american to be able to practice their faith and not to have to leave their occupation because of it
5821401 this is instead about the thought police attempting to censor christian beliefs and christian perspectives that dont agree with homosexuality were talking about individuals being able to force doctors or other professionals to violate their faith in order to keep their job
5821402 for example lawyers who are engaging in marriage and family law can now be forced to execute documents for homosexuals adopting children
5821403 and individual with a wedding service despite their christian faith to the contrary can now be forced to conduct wedding services and wedding preparations for lesbian or homosexual male couples

5821405 newman repeatedly made it clear that he wanted to be buried next to his life long partner ambrose st john no one gave the pope permission to defy newmans wishes the re burial has only one aim in mind to cover up newmans homosexuality and to disavow his love for another man it is an act of shameless dishonesty and personal betrayal by the gay hating catholic church
5821406 now cardinal newmans great friendship with ambrose st john is being slyly suggested as evidence of his being subject to a disordered sexuality the utter absurdity of this idea speaks for itself
5821407 there is little doubt that newman and st john were gay and had a loving long term same sex relation ship it is impossible to know whether this relationship involved sex it is conceivable that both men had a gay orientation but chose to abstain from sex abstinence does not alter a persons sexual orientation

5821429 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

5821432 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving

5821443 partnering with crown excel will allow both our companies to better serve customers in this area while focusing on greater efficiencies between our operations
5821444 we look forward to setting up similar operations at all of our transfer stations to give residential haulers a closer drop off location for their recycle routes
5821445 we have plans to work with smurfit in the future to identify fiber rich loads which pass through our other facilities so we can separate that material and recycle it as well
5821446 this new paper definitely has to be taken very seriously
5821447 it cannot necessarily be explained by one lab did everything wrong while the other did everything right
5821448 everyone was kind of excited thinking that this could be one potential single gene responsible for some cases of autism
5821449 this is an interesting paper with a lot of carefully done behavioral studies
5821450 these kinds of discrepancies between labs in behavioral studies have happened before

5821471 post abortion trauma in many rape cases appears to be no less pronounced than post abortion trauma in non rape cases rape followed by pregnancy followed by abortion leaves three victims the woman who was traumatized initially by the rape the unborn child who is traumatized by the abortion and for a second time the woman who is traumatized by her decision to have an abortion
5821472 to argue for abortion on demand from the hard cases of rape and incest is like trying to argue for the elimination of traffic laws from the fact that one might have to violate some of them in rare circumstances such as when ones spouse or child needs to be rushed to the hospital
5821473 over the past thirty years we have moved imperceptibly from abortion as an option in extreme circumstances through abortion as an option on request to a duty to abort
5821474 what if you found that your spouse or adopted child was fathered by a rapist would it change your view of their worth would you love them any less if not why should we view the innocent unborn child any differently

5821495 subtly suggesting that we bring individuals into the catholic church some may come but what he was asking was that anglicans be attentive to the treasures that lie within their tradition as well as ours

5821750 remarkably at a time when nearly all newspapers are losing sales and celebrity and mens magazines are reporting significant circulation losses the cerebral weeklies and monthlies continue to grow in the first half of this year the circulation of the oldie climbed 15 5 per cent to 28 862 compared with the same period last year the spectator rose 5 1 per cent to 76 952 the uk sale of the economist grew by 5 6 per cent year on year to 182 539 the week was up 4 5 per cent at 150 099 and prospects circulation rose 10 7 per cent to 27 552
5821751 to bang on too much about the internet as the distinguishing factor between newspapers and magazines seems to me rather dangerous

5821756 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
5821757 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
5821758 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
5821759 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5821760 but when it semtex was passed over to different groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time
5821761 bid to exert control in nationalist areas in particular is continuing unabated
5821762 in the decade up to 2006 residential property prices in ireland rose more rapidly than in any other developed economy strong demand partly explains this incomes employment and population all grew robustly the increase in the supply of new housing was just as phenomenal the number of annual housing completions in 2006 was almost five times that of the early 1990s which compares with static output in the euro area and in the uk however when supply and demand fundamentals are considered in tandem the enormous increase in prices was unjustified consequently the countrys property market is now going sharply into reverse prices have been falling for 18 months and excess supply makes further declines all but inevitable in the event of an even sharper correction than is currently predicted the main lenders would probably suffer badly although irelands banks have been highly profitable over a long period and are thus well capitalised they are hugely exposed to the domestic property market the international credit crisis should it continue could cause serious financing problems for the banks adding to concerns about their balance sheets

5821841 my office has received word that hundreds of campers as well as members of the havasupai tribe have been evacuated due to the rising floodwaters and several people remain unaccounted for
5821842 in the meantime the deepest gratitude is due to the members of the red cross the hualapai tribe the volunteers for the southern baptist association feeding team and other organizations and community members whose names might never be known who are making personal sacrifices of both their time and resources to make life saving differences for their fellow community members
5821843 my thoughts are with the families and individuals who have been grievously affected by this situation as well as with those whose friends and families are still missing it is my hope that they will feel both the prayers and tangible support of their community

5821853 i am here today because the people of my district cannot afford to wait
5821854 because of congresss inaction everyday activities are now taking a big chunk out of the family budget getting the kids to school getting to work and driving to the store all cost more and that means less money for families to put toward retirement college education or to make ends meet
5821855 small businesses and family farmers in my district are getting squeezed as well
5821856 it is time for washington to get serious and pass a real energy policy but lately it seems that all the house leadership can do is pass do nothing bills and hope you dont notice that the price you pay for gas continues to climb
5821857 i think some of these folks in congress are not listening to their constituents back home if they are they know how much these high gas prices are hurting real people instead of working to bring down the cost of energy house leadership votes to take a vacation
5821858 a vacation is something that many of my constituents cannot afford to take because of the high cost of fuel
5821859 earlier this year i was at american central trucking which is a family owned trucking company in liberty missouri
5821860 now something is seriously wrong when a small business is spending more on gas than they are on their employees
5821861 liberal environmental policy has shut down our oil production domestically stopping our most productive oil fields from being explored by making them off limits permanently it has also eliminated our ability to create additional refinery capacity
5821862 twenty five years ago we were more energy independent more self reliant and safer
5821863 on top of that because of government red tape we have not built a new refinery in this country in over 30 years
5821864 and it is not just our money that we are sending overseas every time we go to the pump it is american jobs as well we are off shoring thousands of energy jobs as well as the energy itself lining the pockets of tyrants and sheiks
5821865 a real energy policy will increase our domestic supplies open up drilling in anwr and off our coasts
5821866 now there is no silver bullet we need to invest in alternatives like ethanol and bio diesel wind power and nuclear power we also need to drill for american oil and build more refineries but we need to act now
5821867 missourians want solutions not empty promises it is time to get serious address our energy crisis and end our dependence of foreign oil
5821868 this is another example of how the idea of a red river valley research corridor initiative is creating world class research and development opportunities for centers of learning and for economic development in north dakota
5821869 these contracts are the beginning of what we hope are long term partnerships between ndsu and these cutting edge national laboratories doing world class research

5821872 partnering with sandia national laboratories and pacific northwest national laboratory offers an opportunity to showcase research expertise at ndsu

5821882 it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live
5821883 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5821884 and the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment he signed together with the president of georgia
5821885 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement which is most importantly support for georgias democracy
5821886 secondly a very strong message that the russian president ought to keep his word and third a very clear statement of principle from this alliance that a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a transatlantic future is unacceptable
5821887 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia when you start invading small neighbors bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and wanton destruction of this infrastructure thats what isolates russia
5821888 targeting nato allies in this case poland if i use the phrase unhelpful rhetoric i would react much too mildly it is pathetic rhetoric
5821889 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5821890 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5821891 edwards has long struck me as a phony through and through
5821892 as a trial lawyer edwards had ridden the frustrations of the poor to fabulous wealth but one could never be sure that as a politician his populist spiel wasnt part of a plan for further self enrichment he seemed to love money too much
5821893 i cant tell you why i dont know theres no one rational reason but theres a not insignificant clique of elites in dc who are not edwards fans and who are borderline irrational about it
5821894 what concerns the rest of us is the fact that he refused to accept that this affair meant he could never be president
5821895 i was responsible for the breakup of my first marriage due to my immature and very bad behavior
5821896 precisely because its political system is just one layer deep if the communist party were to lose power there is no back up in place only the specter of in fighting fragmentation chaos and even civil war
5821897 we are excited about another season of kentucky womens basketball
5821898 weve put together a challenging schedule and one that will allow us to play quality competition and prepare for our tough southeastern conference slate
5821899 we want to try and establish a true home court advantage and memorial coliseum is our true home
5821900 the coliseum is a first class facility that has been upgraded over the past two years with a new floor new scoreboard video board and sound system we know our fans also love memorial as they have turned out in record numbers to support us memorial gets very loud and its an awesome atmosphere for our student athletes
5821901 traveling to new york city gives us the chance to play against tough competition and vs teams we normally dont get to see
5821902 it will be a great experience for our team to travel to the big apple for the thanksgiving holiday and we are very excited about it

5821931 any assault on the ordinary working mans pursuit of beagling by some green metropolitan latte drinking elite would not be taken lying down
5821932 though minister gormley claimed that he was informed by concerns about the consequences for the breeding season for hares which begins each year in march deputy creed claimed that this looks like the thin end of a wedge where rural pursuits will be abolished by the weight of urban numbers
5821933 hour to shift her the hare out towards the rushy field at the foot of the medieval church she succumbed to the pack
5821934 caught their first irish hare after a fast and furious hunt of 20 minutes and were awarded a magnum of champagne by the irish masters of beagles association
5821935 this is clearly at odds with information on the irish masters of beagles association website where an attempt is made to portray their abhorrent activity as harmless to hares
5821936 their rosy picture of the end of hunt a pack of exhausted hounds and a small white tail disappearing over a hill is far removed from the gruesome reality
5821937 a hare came running down the road i didnt realise what was happening for a moment until a pack of hounds appeared from round the corner i got out of the car to try and do something but the hounds had caught up with the hare and totally demolished it all that was left was a tiny piece of fur blowing in the breeze
5821938 hares are plentiful in ireland and can run at speeds much greater than a beagle can
5821939 the irish hare is found in every county but numbers have decreased in recent years
5821940 if the beaglers are truly only interested in bringing their pack of hounds out to follow a scent as stated in the independent article there is a perfectly acceptable alternative available in the form of drag hunting this involves a member of the hunt dragging an artificial scent cross country for the pack of hounds to subsequently follow drag hunting is fun and challenging for both dogs and followers and has the added advantage of keeping hunt activities away from public roads railway lines and land containing livestock
5821941 there is much suffering by the entrapped animals it is not a sudden or merciful death because all mammals have similar nervous systems they are capable of experiencing the same type of pain and suffering
5821942 any person who imports into the state from outside the european union or has in his possession other than pursuant to and in accordance with a licence granted by the minister in that behalf or who in the course of his trade or business sells or offers for sale a trap snare or net which pursuant to subsection 4 of this section is for the time being declared by the minister to be a trap snare or net to which this subsection applies shall be guilty of an offence
5821943 i walked in on a desperate terrified mouse glued to the trap struggling hopelessly for its life its legs were going as fast as they possibly could and the harder it tried to escape the more stuck it became its terror multiplied tenfold when it saw me i never forgot that experience and ive been bitterly opposed to the sale and manufacture of glue traps ever since
5821944 a 1983 test that evaluated the effectiveness of glue traps found that trapped mice struggling to free themselves would pull out their own hair exposing bare raw areas of skin the mice broke or even bit off their own legs and the glue caused their eyes to become badly irritated and scarred after three to five hours in the glue traps the mice defecated and urinated heavily because of their severe stress and fear and quickly became covered with their own excrement animals whose faces become stuck in the glue slowly suffocate and all trapped animals are subject to starvation and dehydration it takes anywhere from three to five days for the mouse to finally die this is nothing less than torture
5821945 i received a phone call from an upset woman who found a mouse stuck in a glue trap she handed me the glue trap with the small frail mouses tiny feet and his bony body hopelessly stuck to the ghastly contraption some of his foot had been torn off from struggling to free himself from the glue one entire side of his face was stuck to the glue board he was having difficulty breathing it appeared that this poor mouse had been lingering in agony stuck to this trap for days and was dehydrated perhaps dying
5821946 we find it absolutely grotesque and in the poorest of taste the paddy power companys acceptance of such bets as people are placing bets on the paddy power website tortured bulls are stumbling around the bullrings with blood spurting from their backs and spraying from their noses and mouths how can your company justify making money from this disgusting animal abuse
5821947 we are sure that it was not googles intention to be insensitive or disrespectful but the fact remains that the presence of these links are hurtful not only to vickis surviving husband tony but also to the many people in ireland the uk and across europe who remember the enormous contribution vicki made to the campaign against bullfighting
5821948 the contradiction of showing the ads on a book search site against animal violence
5821949 we are shocked and horrified to learn today that there is to be a bullfighting exhibition entitled between man and bull the purpose of which is to try to persuade legislators that bullfighting is a noble activity this is due to commence on june 4th and is aimed at familiarising parliament members with the beauty and proud liveliness of this european cultural heritage
5821950 if you abhor what can only be described as the worlds worst blood sport please strongly object to the mounting of this grotesque exhibition masquerading as art and tradition
5821951 we hope that you can reverse the decision to allow the bullfighting industry into parliament to speak favourably about this indefensible blood sport
5821952 the department in granting the licence for 2007 advised the association that for conservation reasons licenses to permit the hunting of hares with beagles beyond the general open season for the species may not in future years be granted as this impinged on the breeding season of the hares
5821953 it was also stated that in planning the calendar for future years the association should work on the assumption that all beagling events should be scheduled within the standard open season for hares which finishes at the end of february
5821954 following discussions with the relevant regional administrative and scientific staff of the national parks and wildlife service
5821955 where hunting is allowed to extend into the breeding season and this coincides with periods of low population local extinctions can be expected
5821956 this is incompatible with irelands responsibilities under irish and eu wildlife legislation
5821957 hour to shift her the hare out towards the rushy field at the foot of the medieval church she succumbed to the pack
5821958 a hare came running down the road i didnt realise what was happening for a moment until a pack of hounds appeared from round the corner i got out of the car to try and do something but the hounds had caught up with the hare and totally demolished it all that was left was a tiny piece of fur blowing in the breeze
5821959 badger culling apparently has the capacity to increase badger to badger transmission of infection potentially undermining anticipated reductions in badger to cattle transmission
5821960 the irish research is laughable it has no scientifically valid controls whatsoever it is little more than slaughter masquerading as science and is no better than japans so called scientific whaling
5821961 research into whether a disease treatment is effective should always be
5821962 furthermore ireland has never undertaken any research to assess whether badger culling is the most cost effective or most humane way of controlling bovine tb irish scientists kill badgers by strangling them with a wire and shooting those that survive the snare we hardly think that such an approach will encourage consumers to buy irish dairy produce
5821963 in the wake of foot and mouth disease the british government grasped the nettle and this year cattle based tb control measures will be introduced to manage the disease
5821964 irish scientists like to give the impression that badger culling will solve
5821965 this research confirms beyond doubt that cattle are the major vectors of bovine tb readily infecting badgers and other cattle
5821966 the nfu and other farming lobby groups should now have the courage to call a halt to illegal badger killing and to immediately withdraw their unsupported demands for state sponsored badger culls
5821967 those callous vets who have demanded badger killing should hang their sorry heads in shame they have undermined public confidence in the veterinary professions commitment to animal welfare and severely damaged the professions scientific integrity
5821968 i knew he would get some prison time but i didnt expect it to be that harsh

5821970 the wave of foreclosures is unprecedented making it difficult to analyze difficult to gauge how large it will get or how bad it will make things
5821971 since foreclosed properties are reduced in price until they sell an increase in foreclosure transactions simply means there are more foreclosures rather than more buyers
5821972 congress and the white house have offered a lifeline to many homeowners facing foreclosure which could help keep more people in their homes and fewer distressed properties from coming to the market

5822004 anouk reageerde gisteren ook voor het eerst op het vertrek van haar begeleidingsband haar verklaring voor het scheiden der wegen is simpel het was tijd voor een frisse wind ik wil niet langer met jaloerse en gefrustreerde mannetjes spelen volgens de bandleden ontsloeg anouk hen na kritiek op de nieuwe cd een verkeerde voorstelling van zaken aldus anouk had ik maar kritiek gekregen ik hield een luistersessie maar kreeg letterlijk geen reactie ze liepen zonder iets te zeggen de kamer uit achteraf hoorde ik dat ze mn plaat niets vonden ik had eerder al bedenkingen bij de band dit was de druppel die de emmer deed overlopen zeg het dan in mijn gezicht bovendien ik kan hen niet ontslaan want ze zijn sessiemuzikanten en niet bij mij in dienst
5822005 ik vind er misschien niks aan maar het is wel ontzettend vet

5822008 not fooling ourselves to think that this will be a quick and easy process
5822009 we think this is an exciting project and were obviously anxious to progress it
5822010 we want to see whether we can capture the co2 pipe it and then inject it 1 5km into the earth and its encouraging that this has been done before
5822011 we are excited to be working with providence on the ulysses project which has the potential to be the first successful offshore carbon sequestration project in both ireland and the uk
5822012 because as a single entity the nfl and its member teams could collectively license their intellectual property to one or many without running afoul of the antitrust laws
5822013 the logic the court used suggested this decision could have a much broader reach
5822014 the first was that supply routing decisions i e diversions transfers and expeditions were being made by members of several internal groups within dell and that the coordination between these groups only occurred on an ad hoc basis
5822015 the second root cause identified was that the information relevant to supply routing decisions at a minimum the demand forecast current inventory and supply pipeline was scattered difficult to obtain in a timely fashion and occasionally unreliable
5822016 before our model the company would use forecasts but the reality is that forecasts are never right
5822017 by using probability theory to quantify the uncertainty of demand forecasts and projected inventory we have been able to vastly improve and speed up the decision making process
5822018 dell has achieved significant efficiency and organizational gains by relieving supply routing decisions from several uncoordinated groups within dell and assigning this task to a supply chain analyst who makes routing decisions assisted by the optimization based model
5822019 dell is working on implementing an extension of this model that generates shipment decisions between a worldwide global hub in asia and all its manufacturing merge facilities worldwide

5822023 today there are more internet users in china than there are citizens in the united states
5822024 i hit somebody hard up there on 35 i hope theyre alright
5822025 jon voight your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby sic brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children
5822026 a first i must say felt a bit like elizabeth taylor
5822027 some of my plans and schemes have had to be put on hold because there is not much i can do if i cant walk properly
5822028 thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to tie his shoelaces and bad handwriting
5822029 i was having a hard time at school in terms of being awful at everything with no discernible talent
5822030 i am elated and delighted to be joining the cast of csi
5822031 do we really need to see women playing volleyball in bikinis
5822032 would shorts and a t shirt really hinder their performance im convinced the real reason that womens olympic softball is going the way of the cassette player is because the players compete fully clothed and who picked the fabric for the u s womens gymnasts outfits yikes
5822033 i havent seen so much shiny spandex since a jazzercise class in 1989 just google shiny spandex and see what you get not olympic athletes
5822034 fix them so they sit at the top of my ankle
5822035 we love our vacuum weve found god and we gave at the office
5822036 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5822037 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5822038 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5822039 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5822040 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5822041 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5822042 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5822043 sometimes i forget and think hes just on a vacation
5822044 the art cannot be and is not a celebration of the person killed since other than what the shrine provides i have no insight into that person or the accident
5822045 his spirit is still alive and very much with us
5822046 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5822047 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5822048 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5822049 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5822050 my theory is if a character is specific enough and real enough people will embrace him whether the character is quote unquote likable or not
5822051 theres a lot of talk in hollywood about the likability of characters is the audience going to like him are they going to like him are they going to like him you hear this over and over
5822052 my own theory and its been borne out with dwight is that i dont give a flip if the audience likes me or not im just going to really inhabit this very strange character with very specific kind of quirks and if i do it right the audience will like how strongly the character registers i think thats happened with dwight they embrace how annoying he is
5822053 its a tricky analogy fish from the rocker was on the cusp of fame and had it snatched away from him and then found it 20 years later
5822054 me rainn wilson i was never on any cusp of fame i just started from the bottom the absolute bottom the swamp of acting and kind of crawled my way up fingernail by fingernail to get to the point where im having success beyond my wildest dreams in my early 40s which is pretty bizarre it doesnt happen often i think it happened to like me and house actor hugh laurie
5822055 i auditioned for six roles on that show i tried for the priest i auditioned for three members of the gay choir i didnt get any of them and i was crushed i loved that show and i really wanted to be on it
5822056 this was the heyday of hbo sex and the city the sopranos entourage curb your enthusiasm people were watching what was happening and there were a lot of stars being broken
5822057 the reason the show works so well isnt blind luck executive producer greg daniels spent months casting it and the call backs instead of one afternoon at nbc it was all weekend long with two 12 hour days
5822058 i was confident and excited about it from the beginning
5822059 plus it was such a new and fresh way of doing a workplace comedy in this country the documentary style and the awareness of the camera and the dynamics between the characters were so strong
5822060 if the rocker makes 100 million then ill get another shot if it makes 14 million then the road to playing a lead in a studio comedy is not going to be open to me for awhile you learn in acting that you cant control that you have to surrender a lot
5822061 people ask why i picked the rocker it was the only project open to me that had any traction i think people have this image of me at home with 15 great scripts on my desk and me stroking my chin and saying hmm which one should i choose
5822062 the wonderful thing about having it close by is that it means there are more opportunities for all of the cultural community in philadelphia to connect and work with tyler
5822063 they had this romantic notion they wanted tyler to remain in the spot where they had gone to school
5822064 if they hadnt been back in 20 years they werent seeing how it was today
5822065 tyler is about creativity and pushing contemporary boundaries and to have anything other than a contemporary building is odd
5822066 i wish i was the law medical or business school dean
5822067 it was idyllic there were beautiful plantings it was one of those little gems that you have when youre growing up that you dont appreciate
5822068 it smelled of linseed oil which is from the oil paint its a smell that you never forget
5822069 the technology has changed the scale in which people do art now has changed and it really needs the kind of space that theyre going to have
5822070 but when they hang their bfa and mfa exhibitions nobody but us sees it
5822071 but its nice because you can really focus in your studio and be really intense
5822072 theres a certain nostalgia about the community here were very small very tight knit
5822073 maybe moving from this nice quaint little location wont be so bad
5822074 to see it in real life and that it exists its just its just unbelievable it really is
5822075 to think back and i made up a character you know and just made it up but suddenly a man came named henry winkler and he made this character real
5822076 he is in the top tier of athletics and now hes going to get his tryout as a personality
5822077 and tiger woods sure passed but mark spitz didnt and there are plenty of people who they try to develop the whole persona around and two years later its gone
5822078 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5822079 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5822080 one gold medal is amazing two is well incredible three practically unbelievable but eight eight gold medals thats thats well well were going to need some new adjectives for whatever that is congratulations michael
5822081 we continue to evaluate post beijing activities that will allow us to reinforce our relationship with michael
5822082 its huge its the opportunity that no startup generally gets
5822083 with opportunity obviously theres a lot of responsibility for us to take advantage of it properly and do it in a way that not only benefits the company but also benefits michael
5822084 we are currently evaluating opportunities to build upon this excitement however a final determination about our future plans has not yet been made
5822085 it is not timely its not in the good spirit of our national day if we go ahead with the concert it is contrary to what we are preparing for
5822086 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5822087 politics on the other hand is not something people usually enjoy so what do you do you make yourself more visible to the public in a more entertaining way
5822088 its nice to see a democrat blow something besides the election
5822089 we feel that these people in hollywood have made a fortune having a good time
5822090 people like to see them take a fall and get their comeuppance
5822091 neither mccain nor obama want to be seen as celebrities yet both of them are so what we have here is both hypocrisy and absurdity
5822092 mccain needs to paint obama as a harvard elite egghead celebrity
5822093 now he feels like hes ringing the pinball machine the last thing obama needs is to be seen in a photograph with a celebrity
5822094 if i think about it too much ill get scared
5822095 and put your feet in the direction of the wax
5822096 there was this crazy review about a flight attendant who comes to the city just to see them i heard they were straight to the point they get you in and out and they dont talk which is fine by me
5822097 the beauty about emma is shes quick and theres no pain
5822098 she once told me when things get boring stick with it when youre 50 you come together again and youll be companions forever
5822099 to do brazilian bikini its an art not everybody can do you have to have a strong personality it makes people comfortable when you have to undress and you have to lay down
5822100 then i just started doing it and i became the best how many years ago natash
5822101 the next time i went back to her she yelled at me
5822102 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5822103 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought

5822107 nazi skinheads from an openly fascist organization the nnp peoples national party were being trained at the moscow omon special purpose police detachment facilities and that they were being trained specifically by omon coaches
5822108 some parties view skinheads as their reserve the process of encouraging fascist sentiments in russia is steered by government officials

5822117 challenged the definition that existed during their time of what it meant to be a man
5822118 display a few mannerisms which almost seem a shade on the feminine side such as tossing of their long manes of hair very young women are still a little frightened of the idea of sex therefore they feel safer worshipping idols who dont seem too masculine or too much the he man

5822132 were all backslapping each other this has been months in the making
5822133 he comes in not immediately as the boss but he has an interesting genetic profile that in certain sort of medical contexts theyve noticed that many times serial killers have that same genetic profile
5822134 and this gentleman knows this about himself and is sort of in this journey to discover who his true character will ultimately become
5822135 let me just say that i have no knowledge of such biological profile nor would i be at liberty to speak about such a biological profile if such a biological profile did exist
5822136 its nothing as simple as he has the genes of a serial killer because theres no such thing
5822137 its a fascinating and incredibly intense process and i think laurence is going to get a lot out of it
5822138 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5822139 we are not provoking native communities but safeguarding areas that are of strategic importance for the country
5822140 the government has declared open war on indigenous people and the demonstrators will stay there until the problem is solved they prefer to die there they arent afraid
5822141 they are being stage managed by a group of lawyers who are deliberately misinforming them
5822142 we want to provide a solution to the fair demands of these communities because the government continues to act arrogantly without any ability to dialogue
5822143 the underlying problem is that the government is attempting to portray indigenous people as just another group of poor people without admitting that they have a different way of life a different cultural viewpoint
5822144 the authorities think they can calm the demands of indigenous people by building schools or medical clinics but the pending debt to the indigenous population is much more complex than that
5822145 they should not be seen as inferior because of their attempt to block the influx of private investment into their territories
5822146 the problem is that peru has a hard time seeing cultural differences as something positive as part of the countrys wealth peruvian society sees them instead as an obstacle
5822147 some non governmental organisations that are active in these issues are inciting people to do these kinds of things which in the end are subversive activities because they are undermining the foundations of democracy
5822148 how have they achieved the miracle of being able to bring together in one place at the same time communities so widely dispersed as the jungle peoples that will have to be investigated
5822149 peru which in past decades in the 1970s was in the vanguard with respect to indigenous issues is now in last place on the list
5822150 these protests might end in dialogue but the problem will continue because there are no government policies that value and respect indigenous people
5822151 chriss performances at the beijing olympics were simply outstanding and he deserves every recognition
5822152 i can think of no better way of marking his historic success than by naming scotlands only world class track cycling facility after him
5822153 with luck he will continue his sporting domination before a home crowd in 2014 with his name on the walls of the velodrome
5822154 several factors combined to increase housing affordability nationwide there was a marginal rise in mortgage rates which still remain near the historically low levels of a few years ago family income nationwide held steady and lower house prices

5822158 can run in any number of physical and virtual oses operating system environments within a server farm as long as the number of physical processors being used by running instances of the software at any one time does not exceed the number of licenses assigned to servers in the server farm
5822159 in a time zone that is within four hours of the local time zone of the other
5822160 count the greatest number of physical processors at any time supporting running instances across your server farm and assign that number of licenses
5822161 these instances run on a server farm made up of 20 servers each with four physical processors if just three unique physical processors support the three running instances then based on the licensing changes you need only three sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses so you can run those three instances anywhere in your server farm if however two physical processors support each of the running instances for a total of six unique physical processors in this scenario you would need six sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses without the licensing changes you would need 80 processor licenses to support moving the instances freely in the server farm

5822173 i dont want to change the world but at least to have some little influence and to show that there are some solutions that we have that are working
5822174 i see hospital services destabilized as a result of over emphasis on the use of the independent sector the money could often have been better spent making greater use of existing nhs capacity
5822175 heh freunde schenken muss weh tun und zwar nicht dem beschenkten manche verwechseln da was

5822180 even some of the bigger ad networks are looking at buying anchors in their specific categories
5822181 so much of todays market is driven by distress unless interpreted in that context the stats give a rather distorted view of the overall market
5822182 we know one third of the bay areas resales in july were homes fresh off foreclosure who knows how many more involved a desperate seller and a lender who accepted a short sale
5822183 meanwhile many would be sellers wait for a healthier market and many would be buyers especially those eyeing costlier coastal homes wait for signs of a market bottom or for the return of more favorable financing
5822184 the first was that supply routing decisions i e diversions transfers and expeditions were being made by members of several internal groups within dell and that the coordination between these groups only occurred on an ad hoc basis
5822185 the second root cause identified was that the information relevant to supply routing decisions at a minimum the demand forecast current inventory and supply pipeline was scattered difficult to obtain in a timely fashion and occasionally unreliable
5822186 before our model the company would use forecasts but the reality is that forecasts are never right
5822187 by using probability theory to quantify the uncertainty of demand forecasts and projected inventory we have been able to vastly improve and speed up the decision making process
5822188 dell has achieved significant efficiency and organizational gains by relieving supply routing decisions from several uncoordinated groups within dell and assigning this task to a supply chain analyst who makes routing decisions assisted by the optimization based model
5822189 dell is working on implementing an extension of this model that generates shipment decisions between a worldwide global hub in asia and all its manufacturing merge facilities worldwide
5822190 i did a terrible thing to you by killing your father who was my neighbor and my friend
5822191 i had even helped prepare the feast when he received confirmation in the church but the evil one invaded my life and i committed this horrible crime of killing your father im falling before you begging for mercy for the crime i committed
5822192 it was meaningless to have you arrested i regret that
5822193 for a murderer to be released from prison to go home he was really going to be shoulder to shoulder with people whose families he killed
5822194 i wanted to depict people in the process of reconciliation rather than tell about a reconciliation that had already happened
5822195 i knew that to have a powerful film you need to show something happening in transition progress being made before the camera
5822196 i feel like im just at the beginning of this thing and the film isnt even formally distributed yet
5822197 he ended up being the key to our entire shoot
5822198 he would go into the homes of these widows who had lost everything in their lives their children had been slaughtered their husbands had been shot in the head or macheted to death clubbed to death
5822199 he would listen to their story and empathize and sometimes he would pray with them and then he would say let me tell you about the muzungus white people im working with
5822200 it ended up being a beautiful shoot because we all just worked so effortlessly together
5822201 when i was in rwanda i really had to kind of shut down in order to move through it whereas my friend my roommate cried through the whole thing and in a way i lived vicariously thought her mourning
5822202 i was sitting there in my dirty shirt and my chacos and my dusty capri pants
5822203 it just confirmed that it was an experience i felt was being divinely led
5822204 the house that was here was demolished by its owner when i pass by this place i get chills and i feel terrified
5822205 i think there are lot of people who say that theyve reconciled but i think what it means is that theyre just not killing each other i think a much smaller number a minority that is truly engaged in authentic reconciliation where real healing is happening
5822206 i think you can have practical forgiveness where you say i will forgive you so i can be released from this anger
5822207 but thats not the same as reconciliation forgiveness is simply a giving up of your right to be angry reconciliation goes a step further and is a restoration of the relationship between the person whos been aggrieved and the perpetrator in the case of rwanda i dont think its possible for people to reconcile without a relationship with god
5822208 how can i refuse to forgive when im a forgiven sinner too according to gods word i am called to forgive the killer for i did not create this man
5822209 even my family that he killed i did not create them either his crime was against god who created the people he killed so i placed everything in the hands of god
5822210 i did not believe there could be any deliverance for me
5822211 my greatest hope is that god would use as we forgive to bring about reconciliation on multiple levels in this broken world
5822212 this is the most incredible example of faith and courage and the resiliency of the human spirit that ive ever heard
5822213 and i want people to be transformed by that and to believe that its possible in their own lives if rwandans can forgive those whove slaughtered their own families how much more can we forgive the small offenses in our lives
5822214 john daly has produced some truly iconic films proving that he is one the greats of his generation and we feel very proud to be honouring one of our own countrymen

5822218 we were shown the room where packages were made up to be sent to pows in the various parts of germany important was the fact that these packages were sent under the rubric of fake charity organizations
5822219 put into these special packages under these fake foundations were compasses saws escape maps other items such as pairs of wire cutters
5822220 the baseball would have a radio transmitter inside the cribbage board as you moved the pieces you could listen to the channels of the bbc the deck of playing cards if you steamed the pieces apart in between each card would be a little piece of a silk escape map
5822221 i remember growing up in the 1960s my father loved the tv show hogans heroes
5822222 especially when they were hiding radios in coffee pots and things like that
5822223 they had to use different stationery for these different people and then had to remember so whenever betsy was writing to her boyfriend it had to be betsys handwriting and betsys stationery and you can imagine as the scope of this grew that it had to have rigid control over this or you could you know a lot was at stake
5822224 i found this probably a couple of months before my dad passed away
5822225 pilot mark believes the myth that the plane will be held in place by the belt
5822226 additionally the obvious intention of the myth is to give a clear difference in the possible outcomes either it flies or it is held stationary and measuring the speed relative to the ground will never give this clear difference even a car will achieve a speed relative to the ground of half the speed shown on its speedometer so much so that if a plane was fitted with wings which caused it to take off at 50mph it could achieve a speed of 100mph on the speedometer and it would take off
5822227 if you put a plane on a treadmill will it be able to take off
5822228 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
5822229 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off

5822255 vap is a relatively common infection and increasingly one caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria
5822256 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
5822257 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology
5822258 the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body
5822259 victoria takes her position as a role model to young women very seriously and is horrified by this hurtful fabricated story
5822260 some big live oak trees around our place that i suppose could fall but my
5822261 director kenny ortega when he has a bigger budget hes going to go for it

5822266 its a stepping stone going to rangers can he make the english premiership its now up to him
5822267 it happens in every business you cant hold these young kids back
5822268 the fans will see players come and go within mls all the time it happens in every team
5822269 when you have that sort of money sitting on the table its difficult to hold a young kid like that back
5822270 his future now is over there we need to move on i have to find the next one
5822271 its a huge club its going to be difficult for him
5822272 its how he adapts to the scottish game where they play him and how he adapts to that structure i believe walter bought three midfielder players in the last week or so
5822273 its going to be difficult but the challenge is now up to him i think its a great story drafted out of the university of maryland came on board was rookie of the year in 2007 broke into the national team and now hes been sold for 5 million so if theres younger kids out there they should keep following that dream
5822274 i am starting to become concerned again we are not coming out the housing slump

5822277 we did have a poisonous plant but we removed it yesterday
5822278 it was brought to our attention by a resident peter smith principal went out and walked the grounds to make sure there were no others we acted quickly and removed it from the roots
5822279 its highly toxic and may be fatal if eaten when we had more livestock around the farmers got rid of it because it can poison all classes of livestock basically its a weed pull it out
5822280 it was not overrun at the school as it is in my yard but there was a humongous one taking over the side where the little kids play
5822281 i notified the school they just stood there with their mouths open they removed it immediately right next to the bush is a kitchenette set kids can play with there was a pile of the green berries inside
5822282 these are the kids who would put things in their mouths
5822283 i can see out my bedroom window and it has overcome my bushes
5822284 i dont think people realize how dangerous it is when we pull it up theres a very putrid smell very pungent
5822285 i described it and no one had a clue what it was
5822286 our goal is to bring awareness of the technology to the public

5822289 developing strategies to improve the prediction and diagnoses of dementia has paramount therapeutic and public health implications
5822290 when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy normative samples to determine cognitive impairment however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5822291 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of incident dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period mean average 3 3 years
5822292 on the basis of the consensus clinical diagnostic procedures 47 participants developed incident dementia of the alzheimer type and 18 participants developed incident vascular dementia during the study 128 individuals died as expected for the age of this cohort of these 18 had developed incident dementia

5822332 in order to reach people that others are not reaching you will have to do things that others are not doing i e planned abandonment not doing what everyone is doing
5822333 the culture reflects the church if the culture is sick its because the church is sick
5822334 many people have raised a hand and prayed a prayer but have not experienced a conversion from the old man to the new man
5822335 even in hard times and not understanding be quiet and trust god pray
5822336 we are quick to want forgiveness but slow to give it
5822337 even if we dont feel gods presence we need to love god like no one has ever loved him before

5822418 count the greatest number of physical processors at any time supporting running instances across your server farm and assign that number of licenses
5822419 these instances run on a server farm made up of 20 servers each with four physical processors if just three unique physical processors support the three running instances then based on the licensing changes you need only three sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses so you can run those three instances anywhere in your server farm if however two physical processors support each of the running instances for a total of six unique physical processors in this scenario you would need six sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses without the licensing changes you would need 80 processor licenses to support moving the instances freely in the server farm

5822593 it will be measured against how effectively georgia fulfills its obligation to return its troops to their permanent bases and how peacekeeping forces are being deployed in the security zone
5822594 its a very sad feeling but its also a feeling of pride
5822595 the way the geography of southwest florida coast is set up you get just a slight jog to the right and its going to come in and thats exactly what happened
5822596 floridians should be smart they should be safe they should be fine
5822597 lots of people are working hard to keep people safe
5822598 it brought some good rain down there but they didnt get any serious kind of winds or storm surge

5822600 by entering new markets especially alt a and subprime and guaranteeing more of our customers products at market prices we met our goal of increasing market share from 22 to 25 percent
5822601 in 2006 and early 2007 the industry many analysts and market observers were generally not predicting a downturn in the housing and credit markets to the magnitude of what has since emerged and outlooks for particular market segments at that time varied significantly
5822602 was more conservative in its approach and the loans have continued to perform better
5822603 i hope you had a fantastic time at the holiday party i sure did and my feet still hurt thank you for making the party a blowout
5822604 a time when we began to put a difficult past behind us and also to build for the future
5822605 we engaged in the subprime market for the first time closing deals to guarantee and securitize subprime loans with help from the new facility that allows us to sell off the riskiest layers
5822606 approached its expansion of this business cognizant of the relatively weak credit performance of recent subprime originations which were affected by issues relating to underwriting quality home price de appreciation and risk layering
5822607 however management expects improvement in the quality and credit performance of subprime mortgages originated this year
5822608 by the most severe decline in home prices since the great depression

5822623 she knew that irish women were second to none where the weaving dying and knitting of fabric was concerned

5822628 benjamin franklin thomas jefferson john f kennedy bill clinton etc had moral failures so whats the big deal
5822629 we shouldnt judge no one is perfect who are we to point fingers
5822630 good morals precede good laws which is why government isnt much help
5822631 john adams put it well when he said we have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion
5822632 some guys have been released at other places and people are picking them up youd like to pick up some of those guys and bring them in because theyve been in other camps and push some of our guys
5822633 unfortunately there are some guys right now on our roster that are borderline guys that as of today would make it just because we dont have anybody else
5822634 when guys are in the training room theyre not out here practicing youve got to be willing to release them and live with it and pick other people up for more competition
5822635 i spoke with him sunday morning about that about this is a big game for him even though its a preseason game
5822636 its week 3 and hell play more than hes played in the first two and in the fourth game we dont play our starters hardly at all so its a big week for him
5822637 inconsistency drops weve got a long ways to go at that position we need to get it figured out we need to start playing better there so that we can have a complete offense
5822638 if they cant go were not going to push them to go and risk their getting injured more
5822639 if theyre healthy to go i would consider kicking them in that fourth game because they wont have kicked in the third game
5822640 al never has signed a new coach to a guaranteed three year deal

5822663 we wanted to know why isnt barack obama closing the deal among racists
5822664 only if he was running against someone from a group i hated even more such as arabs
5822665 sen obama made a choice at the beginning of this campaign to run as a black man
5822666 he could change his position on that but racists might see that as too little too late
5822667 only if he was running against someone from a group i hated even more such as arabs

5822670 quick lets get the republicans out of power before there is nothing left in the country for the democrats to ruin
5822671 we just kind of felt like in news reports lately it was like what are we going to do with them trying to sweep them under the rug
5822672 we thought we could help some of denvers homeless residents by giving them a fresh look giving them real good self esteem and helping them feel part of the dnc so they look their best
5822673 im happy to give the experience to people who cant afford it
5822674 she seems to have a little better perspective on where im at now because she was saying shes been there before
5822675 were hoping this kicks off an effort for people to really give their time
5822676 its the heart felt reward to give to the community and give back
5822677 im already trying to think of how we can do it again next year
5822678 i think this will be an annual event at slys salon i really do
5822679 i 25 will be closed for just a short period of time but its necessary to ensure a safe event for attendees
5822680 while we recognize that motorists traveling through the area will likely experience some delay we are doing everything possible to keep those delays to a minimum
5822681 its a lot of traffic thats going to have to find another way to go
5822682 we know there are going to be delays but were trying to make it as painless as possible
5822683 its a challenge because you have a whole new venue
5822684 for us its going to be a 24 hour operation getting it ready
5822685 it will be like a super bowl that kind of security
5822686 we are definitely encouraging people to take rtd and the shuttle system in conjunction with the dnc
5822687 im already trying to think of how we can do it again next year
5822688 i think this will be an annual event at slys salon i really do
5822689 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5822690 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5822691 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5822692 you have to be able to see things other people cant see you have to be an iconoclast because you have to challenge traditional ideas or by definition youll go the traditional route which by definition isnt entrepreneurial
5822693 youre always going to be told it will fail the whole inertia of an industry is going against you
5822694 you have to be able to hear youre wrong and keep at it
5822695 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5822696 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5822697 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5822698 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5822699 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5822700 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5822701 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5822702 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5822703 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5822704 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5822705 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5822706 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5822707 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5822708 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5822709 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5822710 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5822711 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5822712 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5822713 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5822714 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5822715 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5822716 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5822717 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5822718 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5822719 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5822720 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5822721 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5822722 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5822723 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5822724 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5822725 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5822726 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5822727 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5822728 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5822729 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5822730 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5822731 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5822732 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5822733 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5822734 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5822735 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5822736 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5822737 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5822738 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5822739 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5822740 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5822741 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5822742 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5822743 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5822744 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5822745 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5822746 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5822747 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5822748 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5822749 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5822750 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5822751 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5822752 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5822753 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5822754 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5822755 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5822756 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5822757 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5822758 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5822759 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5822760 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5822761 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5822762 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5822763 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5822764 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5822765 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5822766 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5822767 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5822768 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5822769 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5822770 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5822774 it is important to learn from your mistakes because mistakes do happen everyone makes mistakes
5822775 so long as you learn from them your graph and the teams graph goes upwards
5822776 india need to learn from their mistakes swiftly and plug the leaks for sri lanka could easily run away with the series otherwise
5822777 im happy with the start we have got but its just a start
5822778 but there is lots of individual variation within that and we need to be cognizant of that as we think about what our health messages should be
5822779 people get confused by the words and the mental image they get
5822780 people may think how could it be that a person who is so huge wouldnt have health problems but people with b m i s of 25 are pretty unremarkable

5822814 russias georgy balakshin who jitender will face in the second bout of the evening has been a bronze medallist at the world championships in 2001 like all european boxers he too loves playing the waiting game

5822886 at its peak ipv6 represented less than one hundredth of 1 percent of internet traffic
5822887 this is somewhat equivalent to the allowed parts of contaminants in drinking water
5822888 we believe this is the largest study of ipv6 and internet traffic in general to date by several orders of magnitude
5822889 though not a landslide of adoption it is still something
5822890 the us has historically been quite sluggish and most ipv6 research and implementation has been in europe and asia
5822891 two or three years ago you could make the argument that the exhaustion of ipv4 addresses is far enough away that we dont need to make the investment
5822892 now is the time for large isps and content providers to begin their migration
5822893 this massive expense comes without the lure of additional revenue since ipv6 offers diminishingly few incentives nor new competitive features to attract or upsell customers
5822894 they can suffer problems through corporate mergers because both parties might be using the same address space or they find they have a lot of network address translators which can make it challenging to deploy new applications ipv6 helps both those problems

5823243 laudatory effort to ensure that front line agents are given clear rules to follow in pursuit of their investigations
5823244 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
5823245 the important aims of the guidelines and their potential implications for civil liberties require a meaningful dialogue between congress and doj
5823246 we continue to discuss this with congress and we are carefully reviewing the suggestions we have received from these discussions
5823247 the record does reflect at this stage that the president was not involved in decisions about who would be asked to resign from the department
5823248 the record does not reflect that the president had no future involvement
5823249 is very consciously trying to walk a very fine tightrope
5823250 if they said bush wasnt involved at all they would undermine their case for executive privilege
5823251 after seven years of error upon error the policies underlying the existence of guantanamo are embedded in law and executive pronouncements reversing this will require bold action
5823252 the administrations misguided attempt to protect national security by creating a law free zone has had the opposite effect providing americas enemies with an easy recruiting tool while discouraging the cooperation of our allies and failing to bring terrorists to justice
5823253 to restore integrity to the american justice system and repair our reputation as a nation committed to the rule of law guantanamo must be closed
5823254 in pursuit of justice prosecuting terrorism cases in the federal courts
5823255 torture may well be enabling future attacks false confessions and an avalanche of misinformation since 9 11 compromised prosecutions allowed other culprits to escape and sent the american military on wild goose chases

5823258 a full 10 db below that of a typical av receiver
5823259 because it was devoted to the actual tactics as the cia people were demanding a golden shield that would protect them from later prosecutions and only a memo approving specific tactics could do that
5823260 he read and was horrified by torture memos after he was put in charge of the olc and long before he wrote the transfer memo he is convicted out of his own mouth
5823261 his goldsmiths admission that he read the second still secret memo that detailed specific interrogation techniques being used by the cia makes it flatly impossible that he did not know or suspect what was going on when he wrote the transfer memo
5823262 was used to facilitate the ghost detainee program in which various prisoners were hidden from the international red cross so that nobody would learn that they were prisoners
5823263 and contrary to the geneva conventions i gather their status health and whereabouts were not disclosed to their families
5823264 by not formally accusing them in any judicial way we could according to goldsmith transfer them out of iraq because formally they were not yet accused persons although in fact our government had already accused and convicted them every way but sideways this is true dissembling this is true reliance on minimal form over gigantic substance and this is exactly what jack goldsmith did in his memo of march 19 2004
5823265 until the time came to garner publicity in september 2007 for his new book
5823266 goldsmith was an enabler of evil including evil and crime justified by the tortured rationalizations of lawyers who set out to provide legal cover for torture for cruelly inhuman conduct and other horrors
5823267 whether lawyers in order to justify and provide a basis for supporting vicious and illegal actions of the government are free to assert the most outlandish arguments in favor of these actions are free to invent astonishing even evil arguments in favor of the positions are free to facilitate the governments evil actions and not to counsel against the positions even though the positions and actions are in violation of domestic criminal laws in violation of international law contrary to the american constitutional system and taken without consideration of the traditions and values of this country

5823315 the average secular person will acknowledge the right of conscience
5823316 who wouldnt want a doctor practicing conscientiously following his or her ethical compass
5823317 i am concerned that the actions could result in the denial or revocation of board certification of a physician who but for his or her refusal for example to refer a patient for an abortion would be certified
5823318 the only answer he could give in good conscience is i cant help you with that
5823319 when the owner asks if hell refer him to another blacksmith and he refuses the owner may throw a fit but most people recognize that if the blacksmith referred he would be cooperating with the evil of slavery

5823322 we need to find a way to respect the healthcare providers conscience without abandoning the patient it cant be onerous patient care is what its about

5823335 the biggest thing was thinking of how long its been since katrina and how much work there is to do
5823336 we met so many people who were so secure in their faith and were grateful to see us there
5823337 i got more thank yous and more hugs than i have gotten in a long time
5823338 i still am struck by the fact that almost three years later these conditions exist for so many
5823339 i am struck by the generosity and the indefatigable spirit of people their willingness to carry on and rebuild their homes in the face of a lot of obstacles i am struck by parish leaders and the selfless giving of others
5823340 they were hard working and had a real good spirit and were sensitive to the whole situation open to the spirit of the people and the joy they have
5823341 the most important thing is that we keep getting to know the people better

5823344 even though people may feel worthless we have the responsibility to do our best to convince them they are worthy regardless of how dependent or how weak or vulnerable they feel
5823345 it is not just an angry response to assisted suicide
5823346 it is a fresh approach we know dying is a spiritual experience we as catholics have clear teaching that every single person has value in every single moment of life we have sacraments prayer the saints we realized we had so much to offer we thought that if we as a state were going to be the only place where assisted suicide was offered we had better be known for compassionate end of life care too
5823347 dying is a spiritual experience for the dying person for loved ones yet few places provide dying residents and their families a place for prayer and meditation

5823351 venezuela could not live with less than us 60 b a year ago
5823352 considering the government closed the first half of the year with a deficit and upcoming regional elections i am not surprised the ch vez administration considers that us 100 b creates a fragile equilibrium for the venezuelan economy

5823363 overall the environment for equity markets remains very difficult as it has now become clearer that we are witnessing a more severe economic slowdown
5823364 the strength in the dollar index has little to do with dollar strength but more the weakness of the other currencies
5823365 the markets focus is just very one sided at the moment the market has decided to focus on the weakness of the euro zone and hasnt taken a balanced view of risks in the u s

5823369 the widening in u s libor is very significant because it suggests that banks are under pressure to finance debt that they have to repay by the end of the year

5823371 we conclude the trial court justice robie then mentions judge saiers by name in a footnote botched its responsibilities under the civil discovery act and prejudicially abused its discretion in granting motion to compel after the discovery motion cutoff date

5823373 if a tendency or a dynamic for the oil prices to fall is observed venezuela would have to analyze the possibility of a production cut

5823375 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5823376 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5823377 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5823378 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5823379 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5823380 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5823381 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future

5823390 u s considering stepping up pace of iraq pullout fall in violence cited more troops could be freed for operations in afghanistan
5823391 if we had left iraq according to the timetable of the anti war movement the situation would be the precise reverse the iraqi people would now be excruciatingly tyrannized by the gloating sadists of al qaida who could further boast of having inflicted a battlefield defeat on the united states i dare say the word of that would have spread to afghanistan fast enough and indeed to other places where the enemy operates

5823394 the great enemy of clear language is insincerity when there is a gap between ones real and ones declared aims one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms
5823395 of the social institutions that mould mens lives between home and work in an industrial town such as worktown the pub has more buildings holds more people takes more of their money than church cinema dance hall and political organizations put together
5823396 the only kind of public building used by large numbers of ordinary people where their thoughts and actions are not being in some way arranged for them in the other kinds of public building they are the audiences watchers of political religious dramatic cinematic instructional or athletic spectacles but within the four walls of the pub once a man has bought or been bought his glass of beer he has entered an environment in which he is a participator rather than a spectator
5823397 intimate social groups come into being there even if only to last the night benches surround the tables forcing physical intimacy between customers small groups of twos or threes who find themselves at the same or adjoining tables often make friends with their neighbours and share wine schnapps jokes and game playing the rest of the evening

5823401 how can it be a large career to tell other peoples children about the rule of three and a small career to tell ones own children about the universe
5823402 ive struggled severely with this issue crying and praying many nights i have continual images in my mind of them having sex
5823403 i always thought sex should be reserved for that wedding day but in our case it is different
5823404 i can wait years before i propose to her but i would like to gradually build up our physical bond with the summation of that bond being total sex when we get married
5823405 i want every part of sex but penetration so long as i get more and more of that i dont need to get married for a long long time
5823406 i have very good brakes and have been making out with her for a long time and am in complete control at all times
5823407 i dont have a license to drive but i refuse to wait my compromise is to ram on the accelerator with my right foot while ramming on the brake with my left smell that rubber burn arent you impressed that i can keep the car from moving forward
5823408 because i have put on the brakes two other times when previous girlfriends wanted to have sex
5823409 i view sexual arousal as another form of recreation so long as we dont have penetration i call that putting on the brakes
5823410 i told her i wanted to elope but she will not accept that
5823411 my girlfriend wants to wait till marriage before we even get to the touchy stage but i want to have some of our own moments to replace the images in my mind
5823412 she sinned with that other stud so i wont be satisfied until she sins with me
5823413 i would rather face the wedding day a non virgin with my girlfriend because we would be entering this day as equals
5823414 if the husband is supposed to be the spiritual head of the wife how am i supposed to let her deceive everyone including our parents that she is pure while i do not bear the same mark i would like to be responsible for her
5823415 im sorry that makes you uncomfortable we can not do that when youre around if you like or sleep in her room
5823416 i know that could happen but i wont let it
5823417 im concerned for you because i think youre deeply mistaken but i wont wrangle you did that say you would be willing to drop the behavior when im around and for my own sake ill take you up on that offer

5823424 u s data has been surprising us on the upside weve gotten used to it
5823425 the numbers only point in one direction higher fed interest rates the problem is the timing those numbers are kind of impotent and so is the fed

5823430 what the video doesnt show is the operation of wayne simoes mind at the time of this incident
5823431 if you see a young person who has issues especially if its on a girls face its really distressing to them its socially devastating to go through school with hair on their mustache area hair on their cheeks hair on their back
5823432 i do a lot of sports and the athletic wear that i wear exposes a lot of my back and i felt a lot of discomfort having a hairy lower back so i decided to get it completely dealt with at once so i decided to go to laser hair removal
5823433 i dont think it was that far that it was self esteem i think it was embarrassing and it caused a little too much focus on herself when people would notice it its one less thing for a teenager to have to deal with
5823434 so much of our day to day existence is related to our appearance starting from how we comb our hair to makeup so were already beginning to think of our appearance at a very early age it does have impact on our self esteem and who we are
5823435 i feel as a teenager im always going to the beach going to the pool always going out and its one less thing to worry about doing in the morning
5823436 its not about a fixed age its about having the appropriate amount of hair and having the maturity to go thru a treatment and be comfortable i will not give treatment to someone whose parents have brought them in here even though they have the best intention when that person is not ready for it

5823445 the big events on tv are the only events worth spending money on for gm to pull back from something like this is puzzling because the positioning is so good
5823446 certainly there will be a lot of changes in our cooperation with nato and we will have changes in the volume the quality and the timeframe in our consultations and meetings
5823447 whatever the outcome russia has all but obliterated georgias possibility of joining nato as it cannot belong to this alliance if it has unresolved border disputes
5823448 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
5823449 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
5823450 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
5823451 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
5823452 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
5823453 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
5823454 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5823455 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5823456 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5823457 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5823458 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5823459 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5823460 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5823461 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5823462 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5823463 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5823464 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5823465 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5823466 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
5823467 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
5823468 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5823469 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5823470 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5823471 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5823472 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
5823473 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
5823474 oh honey you just need to meet the right man

5823665 this is apples first 3g phone and it is a very very high profile amp it is a product that is sold as much on its design appeal as its data communications capability
5823666 the greatest risk is likely among people who are new to the apple ecosystem and this may be their first product people who were drawn by a lower price and this is what they have to go on

5823676 this reunion is one way we are inviting greek alumni to engage with us as we work to further strengthen the positive impact greek students have in our community
5823677 while the event itself might be one evening the existing effect of such a reunion will last for many years and will bring about some positive alumni involvement

5823682 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
5823683 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
5823684 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
5823685 that bout ended in a draw but in the playoff the croatian was given the winning score after both unleashed a kick at the other
5823686 i think toni had a clear kick but the judges ruled it in favor of the croat sort of hometown decision

5823783 we emphasize that a single variability measure cannot replace a complete neuropsychological examination nor do we advocate that three neuropsychological tests are sufficient to provide adequate assessment of an individuals cognitive function
5823784 we propose that measures of within person across test variability be viewed as complementary to standard assessment procedures that are used to predict risk of dementia
5823785 this form of cognitive variability may be considered a signature of decline in cerebral integrity in the early stages of dementing illnesses
5823786 this form of cognitive variability can be estimated using standard and widely used clinical neuropsychological assessment procedures that are typically given in one test session
5823787 the potential clinical utility of this aspect of cognitive function is quite appealing because it requires no changes to standard assessment procedures in aging studies or assessment of cognitive disorder in clinic settings

5823799 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
5823800 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now

5823805 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
5823806 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people
5823807 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

5823841 but im not going to do anything until i finish
5823842 we tried our very best but found that the combination of a lack of consensus from the various political interests the business community and the royals as well as the need for promptness on the beginning of construction at arrowhead would not permit us to pursue the rolling roof at this time
5823843 decided to retire on my own terms rather than somebody elses ive been playing football for 16 years and its a little scary to think i wont be playing any more but at the same time its exciting to think ill be starting a whole new chapter in my life
5823844 we havent been asked to provide him with any asylum or place of residence
5823845 if he chooses to take up residence somewhere i mean if he were to request that we would obviously look at it
5823846 some elements prefer personal interests to national interests they leveled baseless allegations against me they deceived the people
5823847 i feel there is room in our industry for both traditional full service and discount limited service brokerage
5823848 in my business i have chosen to align myself with a full service very traditional brokerage for the full menu of services i can offer my clients
5823849 in a hot market yes many times homes may find a buyer quickly but you still need the agents expertise in negotiation and other necessary skills to shepherd the transaction to closing
5823850 having dealt with many of these brokerages in the past some have gone well but the majority involved much more work on my part due to having to resolve issues that typically should have been handled by the cooperating listing agent but
5823851 as long as sellers are fully aware of what they are buying when they agree to a limited service provider and that listing agent is handling the critical portions of the transaction acceptance of offers all negotiations attending inspections personally going to the closings etc
5823852 again advertise exactly what you will do for your fee and then let the consumer decide what level of service they wish to employ
5823853 just being available and willing to find the answers even if i might not know all of them will put me a step above much of the competition i recently had to be reminded and remind myself that im not just in the business to help people buy and sell houses but im also in a customer service industry we are here to serve no matter how cutthroat the business might seem though it might seem like there are a lot of other realtors in the business it truly is a small world besides that which you give so shall you receive life overall is so much nicer to me when i treat others how i would like to be treated
5823854 for example the current market is creating a lot of investing opportunities for us agents outside of regular listing and selling some of the market strengths right now are great terms rent increases and low prices
5823855 if we adjust our focus just a bit to zero in on the markets strengths as well as our own well be in an even better place
5823856 online and offline marketing are not separate and apart from each other
5823857 as for drawing a causal relationship between successful agents and print advertising doesnt it stand to reason that there are probably other factors contributing to their success perhaps they consistently and effectively prospect on a daily basis work their sphere of influence regularly attend local business and networking events stay involved in community activities maintain a good relationship with other realtors and write personal notes every day none of which is visible to the rest of us im a bit skeptical that mailers and print ads are the driving force behind successful agents i think perhaps hardworking agents are still doing print advertising
5823858 im preparing myself to be the number one draft pick but i know there are no guarantees in this business id be disappointed if its not me but i would know thats the way it goes
5823859 youd expect him addai to play some but not have to carry the whole load
5823860 weve been spoiled here we see this as a two man position now
5823861 when you have a lot of cap room teams think youre a candidate to be big spenders in free agency i have to credit that to the agents there are reasons for teams to be cautious theres still a lot of uncertainty were still trying to get our arms around it i just dont see teams jumping out there
5823862 were certainly poised from a cap standpoint to be aggressive in free agency
5823863 i dont know if theres any way to fix this
5823864 all of the things he has done for that team he really has been the face of that team for the last 10 or 11 years the one bright spot really
5823865 to be treated that way i think is really unfair he doesnt deserve it it is not right
5823866 hes trying to make this decision and trying to do it in the best way he can for him and his family you wish we couldve had it earlier wed like to know but im sure hed like to know
5823867 its an investment in the future and i dont think you can look at it from a short term point of view
5823868 you have to look at it from a long term point of view
5823869 i know that things get said from time to time
5823870 and i think the less said on something like that the better
5823871 i was pretty down monday morning because of the situation
5823872 but then when i learned i was a chicago bear it kind of put a little light into the day
5823873 the green bay packers are very pleased that brett has come to this decision and look forward to a successful 2006 season
5823874 this is my first experience with nfl business the business side of the nfl im just staying ready thats all i can do
5823875 its funny people say i wish i had the time to go work out well from 8 till noon or 9 till 1 thats my job ill be working out
5823876 coach and i sat down and talked and tried to work some things out
5823877 there are a lot of things that go into why it didnt work out
5823878 i really do think i was handed something too early i want to have a chance to go compete go earn something go earn a job and there are a lot of factors that go into making a good football team and we didnt have many of them during the time i was there its a tough situation to go through i did the best i could were at a point now where were going in different directions as people say in the business world but i wish detroit nothing but the best and i think theyve got a great coaching staff that can help them get things turned around
5823879 people dont usually think about these types of cells when they talk about human embryonic stem cell therapy but it is important

5823881 whether they would be good enough for transfusion is very unclear
5823882 i hope that premier danny williams has done all he can in his power to secure work
5823883 whether this comes in a year or two or in two days time i m coming back here
5823884 that s where the big numbers are in terms of employment
5823885 so it will probably take employment of 3 000 to 4 000 people at the peak period
5823886 when you commit to doing something and the labour is not there to do it that s problems for the companies
5823887 that s where negotiation gets to be interesting how much can you do here realistically without compromising the project and compromising the schedule
5823888 i would say there at least 1 000 fishery workers without work
5823889 this is a government that hasn t signed on to any new initiatives that would offset that

5823906 intels entry into the ssd market has been expected for a while and although a bit delayed represents the start of what we expect to be a very competitive market
5823907 the new generation of mlc based products are an improvement over the initial ssd offerings which had a host of issues
5823908 ssds are ideally suited for the netbook category and will eventually replace high performance hard disk drives in the enterprise segment
5823909 we expect mainstream notebooks to continue to utilize hdds for the foreseeable future
5823910 the mlc will go into production in the next 30 days and the slc in the next 90 days
5823911 right now 95 percent of the flash memory consumption is in consumer electronics devices storing photos showing videos if your card fails you throw it away
5823912 we know the data is critical we know enterprise is going to thrash these drives 24 hours a day 7 days a week for years
5823913 bottom line is enterprise users cant count on hard drives you cant predict their failure by being solid state there is that predictive ability you can predict when its going to wear out when its going to fail
5823914 this player is good at video on demand that guys good at iops input output operations per second for database its a highly fractured market
5823915 the differentiation between storage infrastructure will disappear as soon as you can put enough performance and capacity right inside the server

5823932 have you ever sat down and questioned your way through these values to see if they have any foundation in reality

5823934 take from one whites so as to have to give to others non whites
5823935 content of ones character as opposed to the color of ones skin
5823936 think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword
5823937 and he said unto them when i sent you without purse and scrip and shoes lacked ye any thing and they said nothing then said he unto them but now he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one for i say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and he was reckoned among the transgressors for the things concerning me have an end and they said lord behold here are two swords and he said unto them it is enough
5823938 and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priests and smote off his ear then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword
5823939 the belief that man can correct his own problems and establish a righteousness on earth that will entice jesus to return and take his place on his throne to rule forever
5823940 a moral or theological appeal based on a white definition of morality or theology will serve as a detriment to our attainment of black freedom the only option we blacks have is to fight in every way possible so that we can create a definition of freedom based on our own history and culture we must not expect white people to give us freedom freedom is not a gift but a responsibility and thus must be taken against the will of those who hold us in bondage
5823941 black theology refuses to accept a god who is not identified totally with the goals of the black community if god is not for us and against white people then he is a murderer and we had better kill him the task of black theology is to kill gods who do not belong to the black community black theology will accept only the love of god which participates in the destruction of the white enemy what we need is the divine love as expressed in black power which is the power of black people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal unless god is participating in this holy activity we must reject his love

5823966 educators can now customize the delivery of content from printed pages to their individual students
5823967 with content from curriki added to the etouchbook forward leaning schools and educators have an easy to implement system to deliver educational materials and tutoring services
5823968 curriki was founded on a belief that technology can play a crucial role in bridging the education divide the gap between those who have access to high quality education and those who do not
5823969 we are excited to be working with somatic digital to further extend access to our high quality content to a wide range of specialized learners
5823970 the distinguishing marks of a work of the spirit of god
5823971 but will run with perseverance the race that is set before us and work out our own salvation with fear and trembling
5823972 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
5823973 the saakashvili government in georgia made a foolish mistake by initiating hostilities in its breakaway province of south ossetia
5823974 american taxpayers should not have to pay for that mistake after all they already are paying 10 billion a month for the administrations mistaken invasion and occupation of iraq they cannot afford to pay the price for other peoples wars as well
5823975 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
5823976 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
5823977 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease
5823978 this implies that the loop has some importance perhaps in regulation of atp7bs activities and we intend to follow up on this in our future studies
5823979 only yesterday the results of jades test were out and the tests indicate the possibility of cancer

5823986 display block clear both any help or thoughts on what could be causing the problem would be greatly appreciated
5823987 we have to conduct a serious investigation in this regard
5823988 what we would like to do is just to make all these places in georgia very transparent open for the free world for the media and international human rights activities
5823989 weve heard that villages have been burned to the ground weve heard of reports of other scenes about some killings and some georgians who are hostages
5823990 we have forgotten or never focused on the ethic cleansing that took place in abkahzia and south ossetia in the early 1990s where a majority of the georgian population was simply driven out
5823991 any discussion of ethnic cleansing has to go back in time
5823992 the big issue that hasnt been mentioned here is osce
5823993 the idea of someone forcing his way with arms into your house killing members of the family and holding them hostage and then have the local police invite that same person to be the peacekeeper in the house to protect the house against further trouble is cynical beyond the normal range of imagination
5823994 yet that is exactly what osce did in assigning to russia the role of peacekeeper after the first war in georgia
5823995 the earth filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters cover the sea
5823996 that sweet 16 show is a hot mess that is why people hate us in the world

5824023 the responsibility rests with each individual site that owns these illegal videos its googles judgment that were not responsible because were just searching information
5824024 for a long time this never had been an issue but times change
5824025 i think the planners idea is to ensure that stores selling adult videos do not locate downtown
5824026 you can purchase the entire mistress couture line including bras panties garter tops and garter skirts and skirt sets as well as the signature line which includes t shirts and tank tops
5824027 i designed this line with the vision that would make every woman married or single young or old and of every body type feel as sexy as possible whether youre a housewife school teacher or a porn star every woman can be their mans mistress
5824028 through my mainstream crossover i have begun to become a household name
5824029 hopefully when the consumer has a choice between teravision com her gateway site or some other brand my celebrity will leverage sales
5824030 more and more women are watching porn today every day my fan base increases including the female fans all of my products are marketed towards both sexes men can purchase the movies for themselves or for their wife or girlfriend
5824031 we send traffic from our free trailer site to our online stores and vod sites
5824032 although my mothership for all things tera is terapatrick com fans can find more mainstream friendly information at
5824033 the biggest disconnection we experience is with some distributors who dont support premium products
5824034 they dont want to spend the money it takes to be a high end retailer but they ultimately will be writing their own death certificates because the consumer is not stupid if fans want my new movie tera goes gonzo and new releases are unavailable from certain retailers they are doing both themselves and their customers a disservice the consumer will go elsewhere as we see the shift from dvd sales to online downloads and membership sites terapatrick com is growing at 30 percent lingerie and novelties could very well be the saving grace of the new boutique brick and mortar store in this shrinking global village there are no captive consumers
5824035 my sales are up and i must say that internet sales and online stores as well as vod and mobile sales are all flourishing
5824036 the quality of teravision products is number one we do our best every day to take the end user into consideration
5824037 contrary to the belief of some of the people who have been cannibalizing the adult industry its my belief that consumers prefer a quality product over cheap crap people really dont want crap if you dont give the people what they want they will find a way to get it elsewhere
5824038 like most organizations conner strong has information in separate data silos including sales marketing customer service and financial databases
5824039 utilizing our customer data integration solution we are now able to use all of our data assets in an integrated manner to help up sell cross sell and overall better manage of our business
5824040 attendees of this session will learn how conner strong integrated their various data sources and how it has benefited them
5824041 in line with our mission we are always looking for ways to help laboratories realize efficiencies though the deployment of leading lims technologies
5824042 however a lims deployment can prove to be crippling in terms of the implementation time and costs to make the technology fit the labs business needs the affinity for affymetrix package eliminates these stumbling blocks delivers the advantages of applied best practices and can be deployed in as little as two weeks
5824043 integrations can be daunting however using nautilus lims and the labcentrix affinity package laboratories can easily integrate with affymetrix

5824046 i am really amazed that the nobel peace prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists
5824047 disconcerting as it may be to true believers in global warming the average temperature on earth has remained steady or slowly declined during the past decade despite the continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and now the global temperature is falling precipitously
5824048 the reason this matters is that there is a close correlation between variations in the sunspot cycle and earths climate the previous time a cycle was delayed like this was in the dalton minimum an especially cold period that lasted several decades from 1790 northern winters became ferocious in particular the rout of napoleons grand army during the retreat from moscow in 1812 see picture was at least partly due to the lack of sunspots

5824056 in cardamon i found a devoted band with talented musicians im sure that well have great times together both on musical and personal level

5824111 pork pie has a standard of making all maple kits which is where their huge sound comes from but every kit is custom mine is an argyle finish every drum is a different pastel color looks like a bunch of easter eggs on stage
5824112 i use three toms two racks and one floor 12 13 and 16 inch the response is amazing the way the stick feels in my hand when hitting through them is like no other
5824113 it seems to give me way more attack while not compromising the low end it hits you in the chest like a right hook from mike tyson
5824114 the snare is the baby black black copper a true rock snare in the vein of ludwigs legendary black beauty all the rock you need with an amazing rim shot
5824115 we did all the drums in about a week and on top of it we got samples of each drum to paste over any mis hits the tone once dialed can be used for days
5824116 the only bad side is the resonance from the maple can be hard to wrangle at times when tuning the good is everything else that has to do with an epic kit
5824117 if youre in the position its really the only way to release records these days control your own destiny
5824118 anyone who wants a huge sound out of their kit will appreciate any pork pie kit its the biggest

5824125 ne voliti pomeni voliti za ta slabe ta grde ta kodrlajsaste etc
5824126 i thought it was pretty good for the most part you see some guys improving and you factor in the tempo of practice when they can go fast especially the young guys who are finding out what to do theres a lot of work to be done but its a very energetic group and its fun to coach them because you can coach them hard and they respond well we continue to make decisions on the lineup how the lineups going to look how guys are going to play were trying to find out the strengths of our football team whether it be on special teams offense or defense when we line up opening day we can play to our players strengths and thats probably the most important part what i stress really today and i think the veteran guys know youve got to get in shape now the preseason can kind of lull you to sleep a little bit when youre a veteran player you dont play all the snaps probably play into the third quarter and the last week you dont play a whole lot then week one comes and youve got to play a whole game and its not the physical part its the mental all of a sudden fatigue and then an error occurs in the fourth quarter and thats how you lose games i just think weve got to stress upon that this week
5824127 its just one of those deals i think through the league first game you bring the veterans kind of slow by the third game its kind of like well weve got to get them from halftime to get them back on the field because they havent done that yet by the fourth game youre scared to death because you want to keep all your guys healthy and get into the opening of the season its a little bit different when they used to have six preseason games it was a little bit different it was the fourth game or the fifth game that you dialed into
5824128 yeah they need to come out of the locker room and go play again rather than wear their baseball hats
5824129 yeah that includes everybody all the other quarterbacks have had two minute experience he hasnt had two minute experience
5824130 if you want theres a lot of things you can do just havent gotten around to a lot of things yet but thats nice of you asking
5824131 i think hes come along well i really do that was proven a little bit last year when he had to go into the game and he played okay and it kind of gets miscued because we werent very successful in a lot of things i think a lot of things get marred but there are some good things you take out of it too he was a pleasant surprise for us last year he went in there and competed and now he has a lot of confidence when he goes in there and plays left tackle
5824132 in the games i havent see brandon play in a game yet so i cant really comment on that one i wish i could tell you but i cant hopefully our first round pick is going to be a little bit better than our sixth round pick i think eventually that will come to fruition but that doesnt mean that herbs not a good player i mean g brian waters is a pro bowl player and he was a free agent theres a lot of different ways to arrive in this league but when you play here what do you do i think hes been a guy that every year hes gotten a little bit better and good for him when you play that position its kind of like playing corner youre out on an island especially left tackle youre out there in space on the end with their best rush guy basically and hes done a good job of competing
5824133 sometimes it is but you know when you think about it he played 85 percent of the snaps last year you dont see him do it but there he is its all about timing with him and the guard and our tight end and thats what you lose when hes not in practice
5824134 hes going to have to play see our problem is after about 12 guys were all young guys so unless we dont let them play were going to have to cancel the game we cant cancel the game they wont let us do that weve got to play the game and who are we going to play these young guys thats all our team is anymore its young so they have to play if he has to play a little more thats okay weve got some other young corners some free agent kids that have an opportunity too but they need to play and get as many reps as they need to play
5824135 i knew you were going to ask that were going to go into this game where we can kind of get a feel hopefully we get into a position where we can score some touchdowns and dont have to kick a lot of field goals but weve got to make a decision here pretty soon the thing about veteran kickers as you guys all know theyre always out there the great thing about veteran kickers is if theyre not on a team right now they dont need a lot of practice to kick they can kick its just a matter of the thing you concern yourself with the length of the kick and the kickoff right now all of them are kicking pretty well because its warm this is summer all of the sudden the winter hits now wheres the ball go the average start in the nfl is about the 28 yard line if youve got a kicker that only kicks it to the 10 theyre going to starting on the 35 to almost 40 yard line which is not good youve got to look at all those things when you decide
5824136 herbies played both sides and thats the good thing about him hes actually the swing tackle hes a guy that can play left or right and thats a saving grace for him youd like to get your offensive line to play together and theyre not theyre missing one guy and hes a big part of it herb is getting experience and thats good for us

5824174 ask true believers of any faith to describe the most important thing that drives their devotion and theyll tell you its not a thing at all but a sense a feeling of a higher power far beyond us western religions can get a bit more doctrinaire god has handed us laws and lore and its for us to learn and practice what they teach
5824175 humans who developed a spiritual sense thrived and bequeathed that trait to their offspring those who didnt risked dying out in chaos and killing the evolutionary equation is a simple but powerful one
5824176 people have been wrestling with the roots of faith since faith itself was first codified into scripture
5824177 yet they cannot fathom what god has done from beginning to end
5824178 spirituality is a feeling or a state of mind religion is the way that state gets codified into law
5824179 for one thing god is a concept that appears in human cultures all over the globe regardless of how geographically isolated they are
5824180 one of those reasons might be that as the sole species as far as we know capable of contemplating its own death we needed something larger than ourselves to make that knowledge tolerable
5824181 anticipation of our own demise is the price we pay for a highly developed frontal lobe
5824182 in many ways a god experience is a brilliant adaptation
5824183 but the most important survival role religion may serve is as the mortar that holds a group together

5824251 medicare web site is somewhat difficult for people to use
5824252 when e health tools are designed designers really have to think about a broad and inclusive group of users and what their needs and abilities are
5824253 we really have to think who we are designing these web sites for what their needs are and what their capabilities are
5824254 we cant assume that everyone has a sophisticated level of

5824261 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
5824262 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
5824263 americas future depends on the health of our country the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our our analysis shows that we are not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves

5824274 torture is certainly immoral inhumane and an illegal war crime however until people realize that it doesnt work it will not stop and those responsible will not be held accountable
5824275 experience indicates that the use of force is not necessary to gain the cooperation of sources for interrogation therefore the use of force is a poor technique as it yields unreliable results may damage subsequent collection efforts and can induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear
5824276 biased opinion based on a hatred of anything that has been labelled as progressive liberal or left
5824277 the administrations claims of having saved thousands of americans can be dismissed out of hand because credible evidence has never been offered not even an authoritative leak of any major terrorist operation interdicted based on information gathered from these interrogations in the past seven years it is irresponsible for any administration not to tell a credible story that would convince critics at home and abroad that this torture has served some useful purpose
5824278 this is not just because the old hands overwhelmingly believe that torture doesnt work it doesnt but also because they know that torture creates more terrorists and fosters more acts of terror than it could possibly neutralize

5824341 we wouldnt want to do anything to disrupt our long term plans here
5824342 other than kicking the tires and sticking our toe in the water thats all were doing right now
5824343 all were doing is putting our name in the hat if he decides to play then we would have interest

5824360 iraq likely has resumed some chemical and biological agent production but we lack conclusive proof due to iraqs effective national level denial and deception d amp d program
5824361 wow they really did lie and ignore any inputs that didnt get their war on
5824362 a neocon is an arsonist who sets the house on fire then six years later boasts that no one can put it out
5824363 iraq likely has resumed some chemical and biological agent production but we lack conclusive proof due to iraqs effective national level denial and deception d amp d program
5824364 the impression to the uninformed that there was no intelligence that iraq had chemical weapons
5824365 statements by the president and vice president prior to the october 2002 national intelligence estimate regarding iraqs chemical weapons production capability and activities did not reflect the intelligence communitys uncertainties as to whether such production was ongoing
5824366 i didnt come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked
5824367 everyone in the intelligence community agreed sadam had chemical weapons one report said they werent sure if he was producing more bush didnt tell us that emphatically enough
5824368 our leaders misled us and i screwed up by supporting them so unquestioningly
5824369 while conclusion 3 says the iraq has chemical weapons the administration undersold the dissenting opinions conclusion 4

5824397 it really didnt hit me till i started the victory lap and got to the back straight and i really couldnt hold it back any more and broke down in tears
5824398 that you start to believe it yourself i truly did believe it on the start line that it was there for the taking
5824399 this is just absolutely huge for new zealand and for athletics in general
5824400 we have such a rich tradition jack lovelock john walker peter snell three olympic gold medalists and world record holders i was not able to get the gold but with the standard of competition and spread that this sport has reached worldwide now to get a bronze medal to me means just as much
5824401 i feel sometimes like im representing a huge range of track and field fans
5824402 so its just an honour to be able to carry that mantle and reach the medal podium
5824403 i know theres going to be millions of people around the world to whom this means a lot and give all young kids hope that someone from a town like lower hutt of 100 000 people where track and field is not big i come from a high school of 2000 kids and one of only two people who ran track and to come from that and get a chance to be on the medal podium really means a huge amount

5824414 jake thats what we saw jake jakes eager anxious and ready to get involved
5824415 theres no question what we have to do is definitely put limits on him because he wants to be back and he wants to be going we have to be very careful because hes what i call an instinctive player his instincts take over and he just goes
5824416 we said our injuries would be day to day for the most part and thats exactly what it was
5824417 we had some come back today and some that were limited in what they could do
5824418 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever

5824468 basically the man who owned the land rover came in to collect it having agreed to the amount we set but he said he was only going to pay 950 and that he was going to call the police if i didnt lower the price
5824469 he called 999 and an officer actually came down and told me i had to drop the price
5824470 the customer then said he wanted it dropped to 850
5824471 i said i couldnt do that but i could take all the parts back and he could take the land rover elsewhere to be fixed then he argued my last chance was to agree to 550
5824472 when i said the parts cost more than that the policeman said weve got a situation here and im taking you out of the equation and he arrested me and took me to gateshead police station
5824473 i hadnt been very rude and i hadnt sworn i had been polite three hours later i was released

5824509 all eyes are on warners initiative to cut catalogue prices
5824510 other studios and the retailers are going to be watching consumer reaction to this very carefully
5824511 is the way the retailers are supporting bd and how much space they are giving over to blu ray discs europe is still some way behind in this regard but here too we are seeing more of a push behind the format
5824512 much of the drive behind this increase is coming from growing consumer awareness and falling hardware prices coupled with ps3 owners increasingly using their consoles for video playback
5824513 i would be amazed if we dont see a blu ray player in the us at or below 250usd by the end of this year and in order to stimulate consumer traffic in the holiday season whos to say there wont be a product at closer to 200usd in the uk player prices will fall to around 149gbp and there may be one or two companies trying to better that

5824531 as you saw my moms blog its about walking away from a church this is a little something that can help you find a church for us its a little bit harder but for you it might not when we left our church we were looking for another church but god wanted us not to stay in one church because we might get too reliable on the pastor and forget the real meaning of church and at least give a church two times because sometimes you might be on a special day and the next would be the best day so the second time if you have a feeling from god that he is calling you to the church keep on going until the message is loud and clear and if you do pay attention to this blog god bless you

5824545 the question is when not if the federal government will have to bail out fannie and freddie most likely the bush white house would want to leave it to the next administration whether the market will cooperate is another matter
5824546 should the agencies fail to raise fresh capital any cash infusion from treasury is likely to take the form of a preferred stock with such seniority dividend preference and convertibility rights that fannies and freddies existing common shares effectively would be wiped out and their preferred shares left bereft of dividends

5824548 the ability to talk to a search engine is perhaps the simplest its ever been
5824549 those are the three things that i believe are going to cause search to change
5824550 you can see that today in what we have done with image search what we have done with video search
5824551 to say that were not a media company would be hypocrisy
5824552 ive not been successful in finding the right price and the right camera on
5824553 i could see live search was different the fact that its different i think means its going to have some potential

5824577 morgan stanley on wednesday announced the sale of a 5 billion stake to china s sovereign wealth fund and both citigroup and ubs made similar deals with middle eastern and asian governments
5824578 the cic s big stake in wall street still worries me in large part because the cic also owns three of the four large chinese stake banks and is expected to own two others after the recapitalization and there is no doubt that the state banks have been managed in part to achieve non commercial goals china s banks have historically been used to implement china s version of industrial policy directing credit to favored sectors of the economy

5824603 the message she is promoting is about homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin

5824626 the result is by far the most extreme reading since the inception of the asb housing confidence survey in 1996 reflecting expectations that a weaker housing market will continue for the rest of 2008
5824627 the improvement in buyer sentiment coincides with a marked swing in interest rate expectations from a distinct majority expecting higher interest rates to a more even balance between higher and lower rates
5824628 however respondents are increasingly downbeat on the outlook for house prices respondents might view some improvement in the ability to fund a house purchase but their outlook for house prices suggests they will be in no hurry to act
5824629 declining interest rate will help t gradually bring some stability back in to the housing market
5824630 but prices are likely to remain subdued in most regions for a couple of years

5824638 you almost have to become illegal to be legal its hard to go that way because then a different referee could bring out a yellow card for your players at the moment the players and the referee are not on the same page its an irb rule but i dont know why we cant discuss these things before the game both coaches should be there the day before a game to speak to the referee these days there are so many different interpretations of the laws all you want is clarity from the ref you want to know beforehand you want him to tell you this is how i see it

5824651 i think the whole offshore gaming world has been very poorly served by the deer in the headlights panic of the remaining bos executives they have literally taken a company with over us 100 million in market capital and thrown it all away not to mention the looming consumer disaster contrast their reaction with that of companies such as wsex world sports exchange and wwts back in 1998 they kept the doors open carried on as usual and no punter lost a cent as a result it is ironic that the us thinks they are doing consumers a favour by collapsing an otherwise healthy and reliable service provider

5824738 we want the government to change its policies this is not a sectarian attack we take its responsibility
5824739 we have gathered at the hospital when a bomb went off
5824740 hes always full of advice not only with goalkeeping but in life in general
5824741 its an exciting challenge and a great time to begin with the west coast eagles
5824742 i believe the club is well positioned to rebound quickly from what has been a disappointing season particularly given its proud history
5824743 the club has a terrific young list and i look forward to playing my role in assisting the clubs climb back up the afl ladder
5824744 we were looking for someone with a strong coaching and administrative background and identified neale as the best person for this role
5824745 as a player and a coach he was a high achiever and has also been successful in the last 12 months as chief executive of the afl coaches association
5824746 he is a man of impeccable character someone who will add great value to our football club as we begin our resurgence as a powerful on field force in the afl
5824747 he brings to the table exactly the attributes we were looking for and believe he will assist us greatly in our vision for the team
5824748 they felt like at this point that they just didnt need to go forward its all part of doing business in this real estate market plus the soft economy
5824749 its been a while so it will be good to get out there
5824750 we think that we may have a case to dispute the grading of the tackle
5824751 theres been a couple of similar incidents this season where players have been given a grade three charge and we think this tackle warrants that
5824752 owen was frosty at first he felt betrayed when she dumped him for his friend lance but after a while he caved in and has been sweet to her

5824759 the bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing but in our culture we apply for a curse and reject blessings something is wrong with this picture
5824760 to make democracy work we must be a notion of participants not simply observers

5824762 many drivers in our communities are continuing to bring attention to themselves when they disobey the traffic laws

5824766 our government is committed to strengthening the ycja in order to hold youth accountable for their actions
5824767 today i will meet with youth justice stakeholders in nunavut to hear their concerns with the system and to discuss how best to improve the act and make it work for canadians
5824768 canadians want action on youth crime now thats what this government will deliver
5824769 our approach is tough but it is also balanced we will respect the rights of the accused but will not allow those rights to take precedence over community safety the needs of victims or the rights of law abiding citizens
5824770 it aint that bad here it will get better eventually
5824771 this gentleman knows this about himself and is in this journey to discover who his true character will ultimately become
5824772 it seems frank our victim had an early check out time
5824773 the top priority of our government is the protection and safety of canadians that is why in just over two years we have taken concrete action on several fronts to help cities across this country combat the serious threat posed by gang related activities in january 2007 i announced 16 1 million in funding for initiatives that target youth gang prevention throughout our cities of this amount 11 1 million was earmarked to create a youth gang prevention fund to help communities prevent youth crime with a focus on guns gangs and drugs our safer communities strategy is implemented in part through effective law enforcement and by adding more police in our streets our government has delivered on key platform commitments to provide financial resources to support the recruitment of 2 500 new front line police officers and to fund an additional 1 000 rcmp personnel we are also giving our law enforcement agencies strong legislative tools including the tackling violent crime act which came fully into force this past july this bill introduces a reverse onus for bail which requires those accused of serious gun crimes to show why they should not be kept in jail while awaiting trial this law which targets organized criminals and gangs introduces tougher mandatory jail time for serious gun crimes we have also introduced legislation that will strengthen the youth criminal justice act to allow judges to include deterrence and denunciation as principles of sentencing this will make it easier to detain youth who pose a risk to public safety before their trials including those who steal cars our message is clear the government of canada will not stand by and allow our citizens to live in fear this is the message i will convey in my keynote address to the canadian association of chiefs of police 2008 annual conference next monday in montreal
5824774 does not as a rule involve falsehood and deception whereas these are important ingredients of perception management the purpose is to get the other side to believe what one wishes it to believe whatever the truth may be

5824782 one of the cranes was being stored or stowed for voyage and when it was being brought in he was in the wrong position and was crushed by the crane
5824783 the man was reported missing by a friend when his empty boat was located early the next morning
5824784 it was about 4 30 in the morning when he jumped off the roof of the houseboat he swam a couple of hundred feet from the boat when his friends realized that he appeared to be struggling and attempted to rescue him using a large inflatable air mattress but he was gone and hasnt been seen since
5824785 because of his actions at the scene and things he said our officers at the scene knew this individual had some mental health issues he was taken to the hospital by police he had to be physically restrained in order to be put in the police vehicle
5824786 he clipped a vehicle just prior to hitting the kelowna residents he missed most of it but caught the bumper then he carried on and thats when he hit the kelowna couple
5824787 at one point the driver was told to stop the vehicle when he did he was pulled from the front seat put in the rear seat the victim was then assaulted several times when police located the victim he had injuries to his face and arms
5824788 one of the suspects was arrested and will be appearing in court monday facing charges of robbery assault with a weapon assault causing bodily harm forcible confinement and breach of probation order the second suspect is facing charges of robbery assault causing bodily harm and forcible confinement
5824789 a crack in the standard model will have to appear somewhere eventually and rare kaon decays are as good a place as any to pursue this possibility

5824791 i understand another rumor is flying out there last week it was browns days as a dolphin numbered
5824792 the tension is building and theres only so long we can probably wait
5824793 harvard university conference call on september 17th 2008 at 12 00pm edt
5824794 malaysia ist schockiert und zutiefst entt uscht ber den von pro k ln vorgesehenen anti islamierungskongress
5824795 nichts positives erreicht werden kann sondern lediglich gewalt und hass
5824796 malaysia erkennt die bedeutung des aufbaus und der f rderung interreligi ser beziehungen den dialog und das verst ndnis zwischen verschiedenen religionen und kulturen durch regierungen und verantwortungsvolle organisationen diese anstrengungen allerdings werden durch bestimmte gruppierungen wie die veranstalter des anti islamisierungskongresses die im namen der redefreiheit l gen und beleidigungen verbreiten werden untergraben
5824797 entretanto essa gest o vem sendo feita de forma inadequada devido principalmente fragmenta o das responsabilidades falta de planejamento e gest o por trechos e n o por bacias
5824798 a gest o integrada entendida como interdisciplinar e intersetorial dos componentes das guas urbanas uma condi o necess ria para que os resultados atendam as condi es do desenvolvimento sustent vel urbano
5824799 the data show that the family groups that left the park fared much better than those that remained
5824800 in other words this would provide a selective reason for why elephants dont forget
5824801 to really prove that there was a selective advantage in terms of survival that occurred with groups that had the older members
5824802 if the few remaining older individuals are eliminated from a population the impact can extend far beyond just their family group
5824803 the effects of removing old individuals may not be seen for 10 15 even 20 years after the event but will eventually impact the population during the next severe drought
5824804 its hot now because of the shifts in demographics and the numbers of workers available
5824805 people are saying i dont understand why you were prepared to subsidize child care or cover my child as a dependent but now 30 years later in my career its not children its parents
5824806 nothing but ann taylor suits and sweater sets for me
5824807 unless the piercing is cultural id say no im pretty conservative but im guessing the people doing the hiring in the chatters field are too you dont want to give them anything that would raise questions or distract them from your stellar r sum good work history etc
5824808 if you want to stand out in your office and be perceived as someone who is totally unprofessional go ahead and get the nose ring however be prepared to be passed over for the interview and for the promotion it is the unspoken law of the workplace look act and be professional and conservative or you will not be welcomed
5824809 she looks like a young woman on a mission she looks professional dedicated it was a great portrait shot
5824810 i said oh man were really going to get some mail on this one
5824811 i look for a geographical change or if a company was acquired if there wasnt some catalyst like that i put it in a no or maybe pile and the maybe pile rarely gets looked at
5824812 youll come across much better and someone will be able to move past it much better
5824813 we always talk about red flags but a red flag id differentiate from a derailer
5824814 now even in the military you have to work in cross functional teams
5824815 there are those who are going to be gifted in certain things
5824816 in order to have an effective valuable society you need these skills
5824817 there are lots of people who can calculate the net present value five ways
5824818 but not many who can build a consensus for ideas
5824819 they shared with us that not only do people need technical skills but they also need the soft skills that can engage people of different backgrounds cultures and learning styles to lead teams and to execute upon a plan with support rather than opposition
5824820 help me be less combative and persuade people in softer ways to get their buy in
5824821 i think my style now is very objective and logical whereas i think a lot of people i deal with tend to be less linear in their thinking so i need to be better able to relate to people who may be more emotional in their decisions
5824822 her e mails to this department seem meant to exclude me from any decision making process that i had once been involved in we used to meet once a week and that hasnt happened since i returned i feel this is her back handed way of letting me know how all that time off upset her
5824823 you should be thankful that your employer let you do that at all most wouldnt before you lay it on the line give it a little time with your boss
5824824 some bosses are very enlightened and its sincere and other people there is a tone of resentment
5824825 if you need more than a weeks time they question your work ethic and thats unfortunate
5824826 wed like to be generous and give people time they need to recover but at some point you do have to draw line in sand
5824827 am i sensing theres a problem with that if so id like to get past it
5824828 fifty percent of the talent pool in the last two decades is women thats whos studying accounting whos going to college
5824829 theres a feeling among companies that there is a huge investment they make of their top talent and theyve all experienced women and men leaving who they didnt want to leave
5824830 it used to be we picked up the extra slack no vacations work till 9 p m now its systemized in terms of person hours and what needs to be replaced
5824831 we might lose a little profitability because they leave and we have a second person but weve built that into the business model
5824832 its a great opportunity and is not only an opportunity for me but for the whole team
5824833 everyone else has to take on more work that id be doing it just trickles down
5824834 offers an opportunity for others to step in and learn new roles and training when that individual comes back the goal is that we havent missed a beat
5824835 and now we have more assets because more people are trained
5824836 we get exposure in something we normally wouldnt get exposure to
5824837 we see the team in a new way or new light and think maybe we should revisit how we have things structured all the while remembering we need to bring the absent person back up to speed
5824838 employers who choose to terminate an employee while they are on pregnancy leave need to be able to justify that the decision was in no way connected to the employees pregnancy that is a difficult burden
5824839 do you hear them the helicopters theyre coming for me guys
5824840 put me in a place where i just couldnt function
5824841 i thought i might truly kill myself if i had to go out to the field again
5824842 get over yourself and pay attention to what your boss is saying if s he isnt happy with what youre wearing that likely means theres a problem throw a t shirt under that v neck wear opaque tights with the short skirt put a jacket over your sleeveless tops this is serious business believe it or not it takes a lot usually for a boss to reprimand a worker for the way they dress and even if you feel put off about it your boss is telling you there is an issue you need to look at your wardrobe and figure out how to look more professional this is an easy fix chicago you can still be you but if you care about your job take note of your bosss request and work with it
5824843 my frustrations also stem from the fact that im very overweight
5824844 the only one in the office to be so which makes it difficult to find even remotely attractive non v neck tops to begin with
5824845 if nobodys complained or commented on the way i dress which is the truth to the best of my knowledge why do this
5824846 that supervisor might be able to make a note in a future performance review that the employee addressed concerns raised actively and sincerely and sought to improve performance as recommended by management
5824847 weve seen growth for the last 10 years but were also seeing a slowing down of the growth
5824848 it makes good business sense clearly many major purchasing decisions are made by women i think in the broadest sense of the word diversity of thought diversity in terms of ethnicity and gender is basically good for business
5824849 christian lamentablemente se hizo muy grande para que ellos pudieran seguir cuidando de l as que decidieron liberarlo en frica para que viviera como un le n salvaje
5824850 we could have easily solved the issue by talking with the underwriters boss early on
5824851 now we had a claim that prevented us from retroactively going back to get coverage
5824852 people have to worry less about losing ones job and admit a gross mistake to superiors so they can help you
5824853 even with a tyrant of a boss if i made an error i wouldnt hide it from him because it would just make it worse
5824854 i had to come clean and i said that it was probably the snapple i spilled on it she opened and closed her mouth completely at a loss for words then actually cracked a smile
5824855 i dont want to hear every hour every mistake youve made then ill think youre not particularly competent
5824856 last year my performance review started with michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were and it ended with him telling me he could bench press 190 pounds
5824857 theres a sense of privacy and you eliminate your sitting behind a desk and having a power position
5824858 if you get to the end of year and theres a surprise theres a problem
5824859 the only thing a title can tell me is a sense of progression
5824860 the only time it comes into play is if youre trying to write a r sum you get a good sense of what level you are
5824861 in an economy where the job markets tight and were seeing war for talent everywhere increasing companies are doing everything they can to retain the best and brightest
5824862 one way to do that is giving them a more senior title
5824863 we really underscore the importance of writing a clear concise r sum
5824864 i would think if only i work harder i can get from assistant vice president to vice president
5824865 but when he finally made it his duties didnt change in fact he said nothing really changed except his business card holder oh and he got an extra week of vacation
5824866 i was kind of surprised to find myself in this situation if you had asked me before i would have said they can call me whatever they want as long as they pay me but after several years of doing the work and not getting credit it finally got to the point that the title was more important than the raise
5824867 earlier there was lot of hysteria ignorance and panicked reactions and sometimes that still happens today
5824868 even with companies that have sort of attached policies where aids and hiv are mainstreamed with other chronic and catastrophic illnesses there is still a lot of wisdom in providing employer and manager education
5824869 we were at the point where the church was i think the catholic church has done a great job in taking care of the sick and showing compassion for the poorest of the poor but in doing that the programs were for caring for people while they were sick but not helping people get tested and get treatment to stay alive
5824870 we started to recognize as an agency that the same stigma and access to treatment issues are actually affecting our own staff
5824871 here we were saving people in the community but losing our own staff to hiv
5824872 professionals with cognitively disabled children think they cant do this
5824873 we really have found that people with significant disabilities are capable of doing incredibly complex work as long as its systematic
5824874 our objective was to look beyond that we found that we could put people with down syndrome williams syndrome and many other disabilities into roles that had never been considered before
5824875 a fair amount of hospital revenue comes from providing medical care to kids with disabilities we kind of had an awareness that we needed to provide role models in our workforce
5824876 its hard not to get into a conversation about this at the office
5824877 the line on what people discuss in the office keeps getting moved back
5824878 now were willing to go farther but thats not because of what happened at work but in life
5824879 just because something is news that doesnt mean its appropriate to talk about
5824880 the corporate world may be starting to put greater emphasis on volunteering among employees because of the service movement for young people
5824881 through school and throughout college volunteer rates are increasing so as they graduate and get into the business world corporations are looking at that as a quality of work issue
5824882 we didnt really start it for recruiting reasons but i think employees are looking for organizations that reflect their values
5824883 this is one way we can at least signal to prospective employees the culture here
5824884 the senior partner was getting so many more communications about what we as a firm could do we just started to think about what we could do on a firmwide level
5824885 we believe very strongly as a firm in giving back to the community
5824886 and we heard loud and clear from our employees that they want an avenue to do this
5824887 just inspired me to go for that when i went to college
5824888 that made a difference to me and shaped some of the ways i think now
5824889 they are excited because of the persons credentials and think this persons going to be the savior
5824890 so if they want to go to the doctor three times a week fine go spend the money if they want to do preventive stuff go spend your money on that
5824891 its strictly for prevention and this is the right thing to do
5824892 everybody knows that the use of tobacco will create a medical episode
5824893 if you failed the blow test you had to take a urine test it was so demeaning
5824894 we were surprised that there hasnt been litigation out of that as far as we know
5824895 i think its probably legal but subject to challenges from employees
5824896 when the temperature hits 100 degrees peeling off a layer of nylon doesnt seem like such a bad idea
5824897 i have been in those meetings where someone sticks out because they are the only one not in a tie id rather stick out where im overdressed
5824898 mainly its confusing because men dont know whats appropriate what is business casual
5824899 because that turned into two days a week and three days a week
5824900 just to keep up with other associations in the d c area
5824901 its somewhere between a shirt and tie or stockings and heels and flip flops and baseball caps or shorts and miniskirts
5824902 there might be some occasions where the supervisor has something formal to do or someone might be going downtown to lobby
5824903 if i know im just coming to my boats or walking around the docks with interns theres no reason to get all dolled up
5824904 im not saying come in and look awful im just saying that nylons and heels really sometimes do not enhance the work you do when working for causes
5824905 it is better always to dress up than dress down it just shows that you care
5824906 even though its not what we wear here we do appreciate people trying to look nice
5824907 when we were doing the gates i wore a saffron tie
5824908 but still there are the bankers and other clients who always have a suit on which means im going to suffer
5824909 a lot of people think im just going to kick back and start my search in earnest after the first of the year
5824910 thats a huge mistake because when companies have a need theyre going to hire no matter what the time of year is
5824911 people are beginning to prepare for 2007 they are evaluating and looking at the structure today and are looking at hiring
5824912 think about it theyve spent most of their lives behind a computer text messaging and using ipods
5824913 though they are technically brilliant they need practice assimilating into the workforce
5824914 weve seen college graduates stab at a chicken pull it up to their mouth and eat it off the fork
5824915 even when i was a secretary i knew when it was appropriate to interrupt and when it wasnt
5824916 but when i took the protocol role on there were certain things i wasnt sure how to handle or react to
5824917 in our twenties we all think we look just as cute as could be
5824918 its just making sure youve given the first and best impression ever
5824919 you may be the first person they meet in your office and you want to leave a good impression
5824920 they need to bridge the gap between what theyre learning on campus and what they need to know in business
5824921 its important to the business because it helps ensure that we have better prepared new hires coming in to lockheed martin
5824922 it also helps them feel more comfortable coming into a business organization that they have those skills
5824923 on any given day anyone in our office could be called on to work with ceos heads of states fortune 500 companies
5824924 this was an opportunity for everyone to brush up on etiquette
5824925 washington has a reputation for handing out business cards as much as handing out fake compliments
5824926 your business card reflects the caliber of work you provide
5824927 things that you should have known before but it really reinforces them
5824928 i cant say its what drew me to the firm because i joined long before these issues were in anyones mind
5824929 but its certainly one of the reasons i stay here
5824930 its an indicator of the working environment that is inclusive and recognizes individuality
5824931 these organizations realize that a portion of their customer base is gay and lesbian and by offering domestic partner benefits they are sending a powerful message to this constituency that they value this business
5824932 they are also smart enough to know that it is a very competitive market when it comes to acquiring and retaining top talent with the specific skills that these companies need and their goal is to cast a wide net to find get and keep the best people so it becomes a business decision
5824933 i think the corporations are recognizing that in order to be as innovative as we have to be and as competitive as we have to be we have to avail ourselves of all the talent out there
5824934 everyone has something to contribute wherever the talent is coming from we want that
5824935 i get a knot in my stomach i have trouble focusing on anything else until its done i think about it and think about it
5824936 it comes from our natural adaptive ability where we can anticipate things that we might want to take action to prevent
5824937 i spent 10 years in a toxic environment and now i find that im a terrible worrier im afraid that anybody i work for or with will go off on me at any time
5824938 the number is growing as these companies also realize keeping employees productive and focused is of the utmost importance
5824939 if there is no action you can take postpone it to a worry period
5824940 promise yourself to look at it more carefully at a time when the worry wont interfere with what youre trying to do at this moment
5824941 i said ive handled it to the best of my ability
5824942 a lot of the worrying comes from setting expectations in your own mind
5824943 the bottom line is this to almost everyone who observes or reads about this it represents a stupefyingly new low in the annals of management practice
5824944 somehow layoffs have become an almost everyday event its easy to treat them cavalierly
5824945 we are a youth business and our staff are all part of the youth culture that uses text messaging as a major means of communication
5824946 i ended up with a wonderful job but it required my family to move and change schools it was not a welcome shift and certainly not expected
5824947 i didnt take this as a finding that i was unskilled and incompetent it was just a bizarre one of a kind response to a business situation that was inappropriate
5824948 we realize that to some people notification by email may seem cold and impersonal to those who feel that way we are truly sorry and sincerely regret any impression that we intended to treat anyone with a lack of respect
5824949 our challenge was this in an open office environment such as ours what is the best way to invite someone to this kind of meeting while respecting and preserving their privacy and dignity
5824950 no one feels good about being let go irrespective of if they are being told in person or in an e mail they just gain a lot of respect as an employer of choice if its done respectfully
5824951 they become the greatest unraveler of your best marketing campaigns and go into the community with nothing but negative assessments of the employer and make it difficult to recruit any new talent
5824952 my adjustment to my second daughter was much more difficult she was 21 months when i got her
5824953 our bonding and attachment has been a lot harder i needed that one on one time with her
5824954 for a mother with normal delivery physical healing is only one part of the whole constellation of major change that has happened nobodys getting sleep its hard to go function back at work
5824955 the child just made a huge transition and it would be nice if they could really have as much time as possible
5824956 we are looking at a younger group of people who have many similarities
5824957 when they are just coming out of college we expect to see fewer differences
5824958 the relationship is not about the mentor or what the mentor wants or needs
5824959 it really is listening and providing that feedback and input
5824960 you need to empower them to excel in their own career and to become increasingly self sufficient
5824961 what i found was that i like to share knowledge but its time consuming and can be draining sometimes
5824962 i think it takes a real commitment on behalf of the mentor to share ideas and spend time
5824963 it was just kind of a thing that happened during the day
5824964 you need to guide and support the individual make suggestions explore the thinking of the mentee but do not tell them what to do
5824965 it ends up being two way versus a one way experience
5824966 get to know them on a personal level and connect if they dont connect you may have to reconsider
5824967 early on i had this unique notion that ben is so great and organized id really like to emulate him
5824968 i thought of all the senior staff who is the most like me
5824969 if you think of lawyers using one resource the most its probably paper
5824970 most of these things are not costly in fact some save money
5824971 if organizations recognize that arnold amp porter is contributing by adopting this policy it can be pretty quick that you can start to reach a large portion of lawyers in this country
5824972 im concerned about the environment and i want my company to do better so i wrote the ceo a professional e mail telling him my concerns and offering to organize car pools to investigate the feasibility of the company providing a shuttle service to and from the metro and to help facilitate bottle recycling
5824973 i didnt hear anything about it for a number of months then we received an office wide e mail that bins for cans only would be placed in the break rooms where the soda vending machines are located
5824974 our office cant wont implement paper recycling due to security issues but im sending a follow up e mail through the same route to inquire about plastic and glass bottles
5824975 i talk to people about what they are working on and get to know them so that way when im looking for information have a position to staff or learn of something that might interest someone else i know who to reach out to
5824976 im reluctant to staff people who never come to the events
5824977 thanks for all of your advice the happy hours are usually to celebrate someones going away or arrival or to get together and complain about work and thats when theres usually a lot of pressure to drink and drink and drink which makes me uncomfortable it isnt the kind of organization that uses happy hours to talk about strategic plans or anything like that nevertheless youve given me some good reasons to think about showing up more often thank you again
5824978 bottom line parents face these choices not just women it is the height of gender self centered behavior to diminish the mans parenting role and issues during this time and quite non feminist if i do say so
5824979 i read your column what to expect to see if you are any different than any other work obsessed mothers ive known you are not your story is all about you not a mention of your child and his her needs
5824980 you will go back to work soon after giving birth then spend the next 10 years justifying to your friends and colleagues how day care is the best thing for your child you will spend weekends trying to do special things out of guilt to make up to your child the time you did not spend with him her
5824981 every other persons opinion is irrelevant interesting maybe but irrelevant
5824982 the best advice i ever got about balancing work and family was from a mom who had decided to stay home she said you just need to do whatever you need to do to not be bitter this will change depending on the age of your child and the type of job and also assumes that the bills will get paid regardless of your choice
5824983 we want to understand what that employee that liability represents to the overall company and the it risk as a whole
5824984 tended to share and leave our passwords to get access into boarding
5824985 we see who is clicking on things that they dont know where the e mail came from or if they will try to download programs for whatever reason
5824986 they know better than that but what we found is a large percentage of people are like cats curiosity killed the cat
5824987 you can spend all the money on the technology you want
5824988 but if the end users are doing dangerous behavior there is almost no cure for that
5824989 a lot of late nights where i had gotten beat up and didnt want to go in front of everybody at work
5824990 i tried to leave a couple times at the beginning but i had no family around here and not many friends i didnt have resources so i felt trapped
5824991 just like anyone your life doesnt stop at the door when you come to work
5824992 just like if youre ill or have a child care issue that comes with you to work domestic violence comes with you to work
5824993 it really gives our people a chance to see something new
5824994 and if we can help employers we killed two birds with one stone
5824995 that you cannot treat mothers and other caregivers differently based on assumptions of how they will or should behave
5824996 thats important because bias against mothers is the most open form of discrimination in the workplace today
5824997 most common form of caregiver discrimination its not the only form
5824998 whats typically called unconscious discrimination really is discrimination that is automatic and uncorrected
5824999 and this guidance will help people focus on that kind of discrimination and take the time to correct the effect of it
5825000 about the commitment differential between men and women how women lawyers have more demands place d on them and how its very hard for them to balance when they have a family
5825001 mintz levin is firmly committed to providing a workplace that offers equal opportunity and fair treatment for all employees
5825002 in addition the firm has long provided for the needs of those who serve as caregivers

5825004 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to their board the significant strides made by take two since they last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007
5825005 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance
5825006 we are continuing to consider all alternatives that will maximize value to our stockholders

5825008 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to their board the significant strides made by take two since they last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007
5825009 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance
5825010 we are continuing to consider all alternatives that will maximize value to our stockholders
5825011 in the meantime we remain focused on executing on our business goals and creating value for stockholders and consumers of our products
5825012 you want to call these people up and say stop sending out this r sum but you dont there are so many of them
5825013 i wanted to see more of an immediate result of my work
5825014 i always wanted to do some form of social marketing or community outreach that i could feel could impact somebodys life in a good way and that was tangible in that impact
5825015 and in a sense i wanted to see peoples lives enriched by giving of their time and resources to make a difference
5825016 thats a very jewish concept thats why weve taken this the biggest holiday in the western hemisphere and turned it into a day of service
5825017 we can really serve on that day instead of just going out to get chinese and a movie
5825018 it was a conscious decision my choice to join this part of the world that is concerned with finding a solution to problems on a daily basis
5825019 on a daily basis i know im feeding 1 000 people if thats all i do i am making a difference my advice is whoever is looking to change jobs and get a job in a humanitarian or nonprofit field do it theres so much need around and so many things we need to work on and improve
5825020 bad apples usually require a lot of time for a lot of reasons
5825021 they were trying to settle it themselves but just not getting anywhere
5825022 as a manager you can really quickly decide after the person starts repeating a story and they have nothing new to add you know you have all the information you need
5825023 what you really have to do as a manager is make the decision right there and let that individual know ive listened
5825024 ive listened and heres the number for the employee assistance program
5825025 if you spend too much time in either camp youre not doing your job
5825026 spend the requisite amount of time with your good folks helping them get better when you get to the folks who really have performance issues take a more disciplined approach go to the meetings with objectives that are clearly understood take the employee rationale out of the equation and focus only on business objectives and what their results are then it becomes an objective discussion rather than an emotional one
5825027 generally i think people who seek reassurance and conversation feel insecure about what they are contributing
5825028 so a manager could tap them on the shoulder and say what you did last thursday was really great
5825029 and that wont kill any manager or even take much time it will also save time in the long run
5825030 sometimes they are looking for empowerment either through you giving permission or you giving confidence
5825031 whats the root cause of them demanding more of your time maybe they dont have the right training you havent been clear to them they were overpromoted
5825032 the only way to assess that is to sit down and speak to them
5825033 its on the job real time and you make mistakes along the way
5825034 i told my husband i got a very good vibe
5825035 i made sure everyone had an answer within two to three weeks
5825036 in my job hunting my r sum went out in the atmosphere often to never be heard from again
5825037 it was disrespectful and reflected poorly on those companies if someone takes the time to send you something you can at least send them a rejection
5825038 okay did the people die was i that awful i can take it just tell me no
5825039 this nuclear energy is vital following the increase in the world fuel price and our limited oil reserve moreover nuclear energy is cheap and clean
5825040 i just want to say one word to you just one word plastics
5825041 ask your boss for a raise if you cant afford your own food
5825042 if you eat this i promise to hunt you down stop stealing
5825043 i stood in the doorway blocking his escape i could see a piece of pizza hidden in his hand and tried to strike up a conversation with him the normally talkative office mate suddenly lacked words with a mouth full of pizza and knowledge that he was busted
5825044 i thought the fact that he knew that i knew was enough for the time being i let him escape and grinned a triumphant smile
5825045 people have lost basic courtesy skills because everything has been given to them
5825046 people dont get that the world does nt revolve around them
5825047 there had been some rumbling that one of the partners in the firm was the culprit
5825048 this is a guy who was making unbelievable amounts of money and was stealing sandwiches from support staff
5825049 i couldnt tell my managing partner how i knew who stole my sandwich because i probably wasnt supposed to be examining trash bins for evidence
5825050 if you dont stop eating my cream cheese out of consideration perhaps you should consider sanitation as a reason i licked both the cream cheese and the knife i used to cut it
5825051 we were a new system we wanted to unify employees
5825052 we also wanted to build a two way dialogue and trust and link the whole thing back to the mission of patient care and great service
5825053 what was important to me was outlining the benefits in a clear way
5825054 which i never saw before most people think their value is just salary but when you see how much they pay for benefits its a lot higher
5825055 then i turned around in the 90s and realized we hadnt caught up
5825056 getting even why women dont get paid like men and what to do about it
5825057 i know government cant solve this problem we passed the laws that make discrimination illegal
5825058 ive realized ceos have the power to eliminate this problem
5825059 i sat down with my boss to talk about how to get a promotion
5825060 but i never sat down and said give me the exact dollar amount
5825061 i cant say im going to walk because i dont want to
5825062 technology has provided a capability that we never had before to check up on employees like never before
5825063 its within an organizations right to monitor anything you do during work time using work tools
5825064 if you have 1 000 or 2 000 employees sitting at a computer eight or nine hours a day that could be impossible to track
5825065 however in todays complex world where we blend personal and corporate lives it is acceptable to use e mail and internet for some personal use
5825066 companies dont get any benefit out of intruding in to employees privacy and they generally do it when they perceive they have a very serious stake in there
5825067 more and more companies are doing this for all the obvious reasons
5825068 9 to 5 do you know if your boss knows where you are
5825069 i think it wasnt collected with the intent of using it to snoop on employees
5825070 but a byproduct of digital technologies is that they lay down traces
5825071 employers should take advantage of their legal right to monitor employees computer accounts
5825072 but they want to follow best practices that spell out what the rules are i have never in all my experience heard of a ceo that sits in corner office reading everyones e mail
5825073 must i have to give birth just to have my time be viewed as of equal value as the time my colleagues spend on their families
5825074 beyond family friendly singles friendly work cultures and employee attachment
5825075 it started occurring to me what about those people who cant use these benefits how do they feel about it
5825076 if you have a good workforce that people are happy to be in and their needs are being recognized they are willing to do things that arent part of their job just to help the company
5825077 i dont know how people who make less make it we are barely making it im still cutting coupons
5825078 three years ago workers told us they felt overworked but they were patient they realized the economy was getting better and they would share in the wealth ultimately
5825079 last year the work improved but they are mad as hell their paychecks are no better
5825080 if two different people are barking in your ear its fine to be direct with them about it one boss is telling me this youre telling me that i need to know what the priority is here you dont want to just sit and stew about it
5825081 when people offer to help you assume they mean it and take them up on it
5825082 presenting facts is a great way to circumvent the emotional thought process that often goes on between boss and employee
5825083 documentation has been made easier with e mail because it gives you a clear trail of what happened when it happened and what action was taken which can help prove you are not at fault
5825084 most devil bosses are relatively unaware of how they affect the people around them that provides them with well grounded excuses of their errant ways
5825085 people in america dont take all the vacation time they should or could
5825086 people in this country especially in this geographic area actually work very hard have very long hours and are under a lot of stress its a very tough world out there and unfortunately it has the effect of leading people to take less vacation or when they take it they take much of their work with them and they are under a lot of stress and having problems balancing their lives
5825087 we have a lot of respect for our employees and they know what they need to get the job done
5825088 every now and again a once in a lifetime opportunity comes up
5825089 i dont think you should have to sit there and say well i used my vacation last year talk to us
5825090 i cant believe in the u s we only get two weeks of vacation a year then were discouraged from taking two at the same time then were to be accessible and do work on that vacation
5825091 i go for a change of pace i have a daily routine at home and i love it but for three or four weeks in august i want to do something else
5825092 i think what this might most likely do is really help companies and organizations focus on whether telework should be formal or informal
5825093 when its informal not all the policies are set down its usually a verbal agreement that could work well but making it formal ensures that all aspects of telework are practices that need to be followed
5825094 big wake up that they really cant do things they arent supposed to do and violate security issues
5825095 there is no reason to physically take things away to work on remotely
5825096 clearly the government is in a situation from a recruitment end that they need more teleworking
5825097 here maybe for the first time we have a screaming example of what can go wrong
5825098 with this particular situation which is probably the worst case scenario its really a question of human resources and tech people working together to make sure your data your customers data and employee data is secure
5825099 most businesses will probably engage in implementation of some restrictive policy
5825100 now you have this very repressive extensive network of laws to make up for a lack of integrity
5825101 if i were to be working from home and believe that how i act affects confidential private information i would behave differently
5825102 from my point of view its much more interesting to change peoples mentality about this as opposed to what kind of systems we can put in place
5825103 its very important to me personally that i make their games and practices its a matter of good project management its a matter of taking advantage of the technology that the firm offers
5825104 and also we have very good people who work for the firm who are very understanding and supportive of my schedule
5825105 as generations x and y begin to move into their fatherhood years they are less shackled by previous generations understanding of the roles that people play
5825106 they are just more cognizant of the importance that has in their lives
5825107 i felt sort of guilty at first like it was not something youre supposed to do
5825108 i dont remember my dad playing with me growing up
5825109 he was a great father its just that he went off to work wed maybe play a smidge after dinner then off to bed with me now i see that all the fathers are more actively engaged in their kids
5825110 to cope with the environment you need a brain that can use many mental models to look at reality you need to be able to throw away your pre programmed belief and adopt a different mindset in the blink of an eye
5825111 a localized energy field comprising a set of thoughts emotions and interactions continually expressing themselves in physical form
5825112 hemos tenido quejas por la conectividad en holanda pero no m s de las usuales para un tel fono 3g en alemania nuestros t cnicos indicaron que apple lanz una actualizaci n de software pero es muy temprano para decir si los problemas est n resueltos
5825113 estos problemas son t picos en un juego de chips y protocolo de radio inmaduros del que estamos casi seguros que infineon es el proveedor
5825114 relativamente nueva y que no ha sido evaluada en grandes vol menes fuera de los laboratorios
5825115 he plays at a level of intensity beyond his years on top of that he has physical gifts
5825116 five stages in the life of nuclear power mining processing ore enrichment of uranium to commercial or weapons grade fuel fabrication and utilization in a nuclear power plant
5825117 to advance public understanding of environmental issues by improving the quality accuracy and visibility of environmental reporting
5825118 we found that if someone is strongly disliked its almost irrelevant whether or not she is competent people wont want to work with her anyway
5825119 by contrast if someone is liked his colleagues will seek out every little bit of competence he has to offer
5825120 all of us dont want to admit that likability is a factor especially when it comes to hiring
5825121 we always look at candidates qualifications but at the end of the day you have two top candidates and they are neck in neck the decision turns into who would you like to work with
5825122 if they dont shake your hand during the interview that might play into whether you hire them
5825123 are they passive cocky do you really want to work with them from 9 to 6 i think its important
5825124 if your supervisor says you cant talk about salary youll probably listen
5825125 it causes discontent between employees and a very ugly work environment
5825126 you might want to have a subject and a verb here
5825127 you probably dont want to mention interpersonal problems youve had with previous bosses in this cover letter
5825128 we thought where are the big pools of cash and the holiday party came up
5825129 i think theyre all feeling they are playing an active role in helping that area recover
5825130 i see this as a way to reach out we want to make sure were involved in our communities and make sure were a good corporate citizen
5825131 our commitment has been no matter how big we grow its a key element of our culture
5825132 i think everyone was touched with what was going on with katrina
5825133 assuming there are no other tragedies in the world absolutely its a blast
5825134 because were satellite offices it goes a long way to build morale it says a lot for the company that they bring everyone together
5825135 it makes me feel very proud to work for this company
5825136 i just dont want to wear something that makes you feel bad about yourself you go in with a negative attitude so you have to work hard to overcompensate for it
5825137 when we get dressed for the day were also going through a game plan
5825138 something that makes me feel like i had good experiences in gives me a little edge
5825139 my dry cleaner is responsible for taking out the bad karma
5825140 hey everybody i think we need a morale boost around here dont you come on come on over pull up a chair
5825141 i know im the boss but thats not saying the rest of you dont bring something to the table dont have some skills today i will tell you what you mean to this office
5825142 youve got a legal background and you are our it go to guy
5825143 uh well i just mean you came straight here from college
5825144 she called the person in charge while i was gone and said im moving to california and going to art school
5825145 we didnt hate her but im a big believer in not burning any bridge
5825146 at first we tried to avoid each other but that put a strain on the relationship
5825147 pretty much everyone suspected or knew but no one really cared
5825148 we had to work together on a project right after she dumped me
5825149 especially because we worked directly with each other and this created competition which led to me taking his job obviously this did not help our personal relationship
5825150 our relationship ended when he stood me up for our office christmas party turned out he had two small kids at home which i knew about and a live in girlfriend which i didnt
5825151 i dont think employers should be in a position of trying to be relationship police and asking employees to come forward and identify relationships
5825152 it either risks invasion of privacy or has the appearance of invasion of privacy
5825153 both in respect to blogging or other non blogging activities you have to put employees on notice of dos and donts
5825154 i could see the train was pulling into the station
5825155 i said look this is clear its just not a good fit
5825156 she asked to stay for another month to give herself time to find a new job and tie up loose ends while earning a paycheck
5825157 im constantly helping friends with crafting r sum s i constantly have friends passing on openings to me and then i pass them on to other people its just like good karma it comes back
5825158 my resolution is to take advantage of a generous tuition reimbursement program and become an invaluable asset to my employer
5825159 i wanted to step back and figure out what i was working toward and what i wanted to focus on
5825160 its a hard transition to move into more delegating and seeing a bigger picture
5825161 set boundaries and expectations and learning that the details someone else can do
5825162 if youre able to keep on the professional track and youre coming in three days a week youre able to really make a contribution but youre not consumed by the job
5825163 i knew the position had always been a full time job that was probably 50 hours or so
5825164 so to hear i was given that opportunity on a part time basis i should have thought twice
5825165 whats a little ironic nowadays companies wont give character references they will confirm and deny dates job titles and overall duties
5825166 the things candidates are lying most about are the things you can easily check up on
5825167 for me if i had an employee mislead me on a r sum and a year or two later found out something wasnt right and if they were doing a great job im probably going to let it pass
5825168 you get that sixth sense that someones just not coming clean
5825169 i felt like i was having a conversation with my sister it turned into a confrontation much more quickly than it should have
5825170 through it all i just thought it would have been so much better at the outset if she said frankly
5825171 i thought the level of camaraderie was deeper than it was
5825172 the lying thing to me just kind of doubly hurt i thought we had the camaraderie second i was just kind of if we didnt have that why didnt she just tell me it wasnt working
5825173 how much would this baby affect the success of my company and those employees dependent on me for their living
5825174 the advantage you have is you can do your work at hours other than 8 to 5 you can set your hours to a great extent
5825175 you can work around childrens schedules as they grow up
5825176 a significant amount of energy is required its a day that doesnt end till midnight if you have the energy to do that and the desire great but if you expect to put in a four hour day and expect to earn what you were at a corporate job thats not going to happen
5825177 as the conversations started i thought my god how am i going to do this
5825178 i had been working 16 17 18 hour days i didnt have enough people below me to do my tasks
5825179 if i say something about this one pet peeve im going to look petty
5825180 it goes one step beyond annoying it makes me think about all these other things i should be doing
5825181 i just kind of feel like its a lack of respect or whatever is happening to the other person is more important than what im doing
5825182 its a busy office they should be able to pick up my phone i know its my thing
5825183 just my craziness they laugh and then dont touch my phone
5825184 it sounds so petty and so funny but they ultimately do impact peoples work and need to be addressed
5825185 it makes me feel like im not valuable at all no one cares but im supposed to pretend they do
5825186 i know people dont have an investment in me as a person or as a friend
5825187 what you need to do is move them away from that expectation or they wont plan ahead
5825188 we give the impression that we can go to another person and they will do something for us immediately
5825189 a typical to do list might contain dozens of items that a person would naively hope to accomplish in a day
5825190 there has been a big change in the composition of the workforce but the structure has not changed
5825191 if theres any attention your family needs all that has to happen outside of work hours
5825192 with 3 5 to 4 percent to work with its difficult to make any meaningful differential between high and low performers
5825193 avoiding the corporate death spiral recognizing and eliminating the signs of decline
5825194 theyre just too desperate to get the offer and theyre so busy selling themselves they dont see if its a good fit or not
5825195 i always wanted to get into this and got the opportunity and didnt want to pass that up
5825196 they said there might be times where youll pitch in to help
5825197 the real jim halpert is sociable and good with people and kind of tall
5825198 we are different in that im a good deal more directed and focused than the jim halpert on the show
5825199 my hair looked a bit like that when i was in high school and college
5825200 the idea of the show is to take the classic situations that occur in the workplace and to amplify them to the point where theyre absurd and everyone can sit down and laugh about diversity training the office christmas party inter office romance
5825201 pined after her but waited over a year until that relationship ended then swept her off her feet
5825202 i stayed in a job i hated because it wasnt the job that i hated it was only parts of the job i felt at times like i was being dragged down a winding hill by a blindfolded runaway bull
5825203 those who are left are thinking whats expected of me to assume new roles and new goals and those leaving are thinking the same thing
5825204 some people accept it with much enthusiasm because they are looking forward to their next step in life
5825205 most employees who are going to remain are anxious about their ability to adapt successfully
5825206 everybodys looking for that gosh if i just had this employee or that employee
5825207 the fact is you probably have someone like that on your team already
5825208 youre not going to be able to get your talent from outside
5825209 youre losing some of the historical knowledge of the company and culture and product its important to get people with those experiences
5825210 we see employees who can step out of their comfort zone
5825211 its a great way to get noticed in a corporation
5825212 if i were running the obama denver effort i would want to keep news about hollyweirdos attending the convention and going to private parties down to a bare minimum
5825213 its the first digital movie camera that matches the detail and richness of analog film
5825214 and thats what makes the red so exciting it delivers all the dazzle of analog but its easier to use and cheaper by orders of magnitude than a film camera in other words

5825414 we are now working with one liter amounts there are million liter fermenters we have to scale up three orders of magnitude which is pretty daunting but not impossible

5825453 para que los contenidos sean cada vez m s atractivos y mejor realizados
5825454 este programa atiende a la formaci n de ciudadanos porque adem s tiene en cuenta que ser emisor implica responsabilidad y creo que tambi n genera un ant doto para contrarrestar una incre ble deformaci n de los medios de comunicaci n
5825455 la comunicaci n requiere responsabilidad plena civil y social y creemos que este programa va a fortalecer a los adolescentes que se van a proteger de esas comunicaciones panfletarias y an nimas porque desde j venes van a estar acostumbrados a dar la cara que es otro aprendizaje que tenemos que tener en nuestra sociedad
5825456 estamos generando cada vez m s espacios para refugiarnos an nimamente y comunicar irresponsablemente cuando la comunicaci n requiere responsabilidad plena civil y social civil porque te hac s cargo de lo que dec s y social porque comunic s para un p blico heterog neo que no siempre sabe que aquello que se comunica es la verdad o no

5825458 the united states must seize this opportunity and allow the iraqis to take control of their own security by beginning a responsible phased withdrawal of u s combat troops from iraq
5825459 a massive yet safe and orderly redeployment of u s forces essential equipment and support personnel is within the capabilities of the u s military and could be achieved efficiently and safely over eight to 10 months
5825460 withdrawal is a conventional operation that plays to the strengths of the u s military
5825461 on notice that they not the united states will be responsible for the consequences of iraqs internal stability
5825462 its at least possible that the climate for a withdrawal will be relatively secure
5825463 my body betrayed me once again she said later explaining that she felt a pull in her hamstring only 80 meters from the finish line
5825464 i remember in 2004 at the olympics trials i was like you know what coach shaver
5825465 and he was just like lolo i do not want you to give up on your dream yet
5825466 the hurdles were just coming up so fast and i just could not maintain control she said after the race
5825467 its like a car and youre racing a car and youre going as fast as you can and you hit a curve either you crash and burn or you maintain control and i crashed and burned today
5825468 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race its just a shame that it was on the biggest race of my life
5825469 my mind was numb but just getting back on my two feet and standing strong i mean thats it i worked so hard for this and it disappeared in less than a second
5825470 there were times when we asked her to refrain from training because she was hurting so much said her mother sharon
5825471 but because of the determination that she personally had she wanted to go through it
5825472 battle wounds she called them and the resolve shed shown had put her in the lead tuesday night before in her own words her body betrayed her again first the lesions and the ulcers now this
5825473 i felt so good i was already getting a little bit elated coming off the turn because i know how my races usually go
5825474 i feel so betrayed by my body once again she said
5825475 i have a really strong faith and i know that everything happens for a reason i just dont know what this lesson is for i dont know what lesson i have left to learn
5825476 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5825477 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5825478 i was already getting up and elated coming off the turn because i know how my races usually go i just had a really tough break on that one
5825479 why should it be spoiled unless someone tries to spoil it for me
5825480 im going to out there to run my heart out
5825481 it was like racing a car at max velocity when you hit a curve you either maintain control or you crash and burn
5825482 today i crashed and burned im shocked and sad but im happy for the girls
5825483 the georgian football federation will serve as the host association for this match
5825484 it was important that we did play the game no matter where it was we have everything set out and the players were looking forward to the two games
5825485 they have made a decision on that now and i think its important they have made that decision
5825486 at least we know we are playing that game and people are looking forward to that now
5825487 but no matter where the game was we would have gone and played it anywhere because it is important for the group and it is important to get the three points
5825488 if i could take one of the two races away from auto club speedway formerly known as california speedway i would move it to because
5825489 if i could get a free ticket to the night race at bristol i would do this to get it

5825499 all of the schools that kyle visited are showing interest in him
5825500 he is highly rated by colorado and he could get an offer after the first two weeks of the season most of the schools that are recruiting him want to see senior season footage
5825501 i was asked to describe kyle by a d i coach in one word
5825502 on every level he has played and in every sport he has been on championship team
5825503 as a sophomore kyle played fullback and tight end for us but for his junior season we switched him to right tackle because that is where we needed him
5825504 a lot of guys wouldnt want to switch to offensive line from fullback but that is the kind of kid he is he will do whatever is best for the team

5825553 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak

5825567 with their particular situation being in a rather remote area im sure they just dont have the funding to have a full time police department

5825571 those questions are best left to the mccain campaign at this time
5825572 first if your instinct is to run on experience it doesnt hurt to have a vice president whos got it too
5825573 it would fit well into the narrative of his not having any politics in the white house
5825574 no more karl rove were governing here its an easy natural message for mccain and it implies a one term pledge without actually saying it
5825575 the question is on sept 15 or 25 is he in better shape or not
5825576 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5825577 that would be like obama picking some right winger that agrees with him on one thing
5825578 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
5825579 the drive bys are just hoping for it because they know the base will totally turn on mccain if this is the case
5825580 if he picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty and the drive bys know it
5825581 the question is how to get the message to mccain
5825582 you dont get in mccains face and say dont do it thats a dumb thing to do you have to say something like
5825583 the last time i checked there was still a pro life plan in the platform so he needs to do some research i believe in where his party stands on the issue of life

5825646 when i put forward my points in the morning some ipcc official got up to say that what i was saying was nonsense see when we have that sort of attitude that sort of dogma against a scientific observation that would not actually end up in very very positive debate we should maintain our sense of proportion maintain our sense of objectivity allow a discussion not have fixed mindset about global warming
5825647 i think the scientific community is putting way too much faith on these models especially given the fact that they have not been able to predict 5 day weather forecasts yet and weather systems are simpler than the climate and every 5 days they have a chance to test the model and improve it
5825648 a lot of the predictions made by modelers and models do not match very well to the longer term geologic record and even more scary most atmospheric scientists are not aware of that
5825649 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle

5825672 the public interest can best be served by getting as much broadband in front of as many people as possible as quickly as possible and ensuring that investment keeps up with demand
5825673 to a large extent this is a matter of taking down the barriers to investment and refraining from erecting new ones

5825694 i think it s not big 70 percent is graffiti 20 stickers and 10 stencils
5825695 the graffiti of course is big but i don t really like the attitude they have by claiming public property and fighting over it and tagging i just don t see the point just some kids trying to get famous by damaging other people s property
5825696 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
5825697 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
5825698 before people have had this idea that visual memory has a very simple limit three or four items and thats it
5825699 what my research shows is that there isnt that upper limit but instead theres a single resource thats shared out between items what happens is that the items that stand out get more of this resource and so are remembered with greater precision
5825700 force your crotch to mold the hard leather saddle saddle
5825701 i love the ability to move farther back while climbing

5825705 as im sure youre all aware foreign formats have increased in popularity as the basis for us television development and production what is often overlooked or not fully appreciated are the complexities associated with negotiating format deals coupled with the fact that often times what is appealing in the format may be nothing more than a general underlying premise which in and of itself may be no reason to license the underlying property
5825706 to force immediate registration with the listeners if you dont do this the listener registration will usually be updated within a minute or two anyway automatically but this command can help shorten debugging cycles when necessary
5825707 we were shown the room where packages were made up to be sent to pows in the various parts of germany important was the fact that these packages were sent under the rubric of fake charity organizations
5825708 put into these special packages under these fake foundations were compasses saws escape maps other items such as pairs of wire cutters
5825709 the baseball would have a radio transmitter inside the cribbage board as you moved the pieces you could listen to the channels of the bbc the deck of playing cards if you steamed the pieces apart in between each card would be a little piece of a silk escape map
5825710 i remember growing up in the 1960s my father loved the tv show hogans heroes
5825711 especially when they were hiding radios in coffee pots and things like that
5825712 they had to use different stationery for these different people and then had to remember so whenever betsy was writing to her boyfriend it had to be betsys handwriting and betsys stationery and you can imagine as the scope of this grew that it had to have rigid control over this or you could you know a lot was at stake
5825713 i found this probably a couple of months before my dad passed away
5825714 just do it how one couple turned off the tv and turned on their sex lives for 101 days no excuses
5825715 at first i sort of thought thats funny ha ha
5825716 but i know annie pretty well and she loves a challenge we talked about it more that night and the next morning and i knew she was serious
5825717 when saturday night sex becomes routine that is when couples need to make sure they are still wooing each other by incorporating spontaneity and novelty
5825718 the next morning i woke up and thought we really need to do this
5825719 our marriage really needs to do this thats how it started
5825720 youve got your porno but now its my turn sex toys
5825721 ive got to research it but im always hearing about how women are using sex toys there are sex toys parties its on oprah its supposed to be healthy im nearly forty and ive never even touched one
5825722 you work you commute you have kids you have to clean up make sure they brush their teeth by the time that part of the day is over you are just tired and ready to zone out
5825723 we werent doing it for the sake of doing it
5825724 the point was to see what would happen we treated it like we were dating again we started looking forward to it
5825725 i really think we communicate so much clearer and with so much more honesty now
5825726 there were so many times before that we hadnt even hugged for like three days in a row we gravitate toward rubbing each others backs more we realize how important it is to put the kids to bed and spend time together
5825727 i would love to see this conversation in every home in america
5825728 gay straight with kids or without this is a conversation that people shrink from and yet its so important once you stop making love to your partner you become roommates whether its five times a month or three times a month just being comfortable with that number is most important
5825729 urinary arsenic reflects exposures from all routes air water and food which makes it difficult to track the actual source of arsenic exposure let alone use the results from this study to establish drinking water standards
5825730 its hard to see how hed bring strength to the ticket in the national security area
5825731 having a governor on the ticket from virginia would be of some help
5825732 the feeling of being hemmed in by rules matched that of being hemmed in by people
5825733 reading history one finds that there have been periods say toward the end of the middle ages the late fifteenth century when everything looked very much as it looks now and even though we may say their difficulties were lesser their powers were less too the interesting question is whether our greater powers and our greater knowledge and by that i dont mean our deeper knowledge i mean our more extensive awareness of whats going on everywhere at once are going to be helpful or harmful the possible harm of knowing too much is that it excludes possibilities that might work you say oh we cant do that look that the statistics
5825734 there are a great many things you should have figured out mr slade
5825735 no culture without norms mr slade its an elementary principle history gives us no reason for optimism about the triumph of civilization over barbarity where we do not move forward we regress to be sure it begins with slight lapses errors of usage confusing disinterest with uninterest using hopefully for it is to be hoped and then with astonishing swiftness the rot sets in with our sense of language dulled who can appreciate the exquisite verbal precision of the very finest literature we cease to judge we join the relativists party of mindless tolerance we descend into the torpor of cultural egalitarianism
5825736 and the sign says to be quiet in the library
5825737 not only a source of art but the ultimate one
5825738 these radicals had begun to study the old neglected literary and photographic texts and maintained they were the record of a fuller life they urged looking around
5825739 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
5825740 the couch was loaded by plaintiff and defendant into a truck and driven to the front of the business so it could be placed on defendants showroom floor
5825741 while unloading the couch plaintiff was put in a position by defendant to hold and lift the couch causing him to twist his back additionally when attempting to move the couch into the business the doors were too narrow and the couch required much maneuvering and struggle to get it into the building
5825742 if decedent watkins was served any alcohol by any of defendants employees which defendant denies each and every one of those employees had attended at least one training program approved by the alcoholic beverage commission
5825743 the dps stopped traffic because a vehicle driven by meagan watkins was traveling westbound on ih 10 in the eastbound lane threatening to cause a serious collision
5825744 meagan watkins vehicle did indeed strike vehicle head on thereby directly and proximately causing injuries and damages to counter plaintiff

5825749 for procedural jocks life dont get much better than this
5825750 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life

5825779 were very pleased that the court recognized that the mbtas legal arguments were meritless
5825780 the mbtas attempts to silence these students were not only misguided but blatantly unconstitutional
5825781 the judge today correctly found that it was unlikely that the cfaa would apply to security researchers giving an academic talk
5825782 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities silencing researchers does not improve security the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not
5825783 the only thing keeping the students and the mbta from working together cooperatively to resolve the fare payment card security issues is the lawsuit itself
5825784 the mbta would be far better off focusing on improving the mbtas fare payment security instead of pursuing needless litigation

5825794 paul we should really do this in miniature we understand that you want to do everything practical but we really feel that this is like an impossible stunt to drive a seventy five foot armor plated truck into a metal post at sixty miles per hour and dead stop it we dont think it can be done
5825795 i think this thing is going to go like that but i dont know weve tested it twice and its done something completely different so be on your toes

5825802 the task democrats face is to stitch together often narrow majorities in industrial states with victories on the coasts where ethnic minorities and upper middle class professionals weigh more heavily in their support base blue collar unions have declined since the 1970s while advocacy groups pushing minority and lifestyle issues have proliferated reshaping public agendas no wonder progressives have a hard time offering a clear set of compelling policies to economically struggling citizens

5825808 in afghanistan its time to move from a combat oriented approach to one that focuses on negotiation peacemaking and nation building its time to move nato troops out and un peacekeepers in
5825809 the first thing is to make clear that we are taking our troops out no one takes you seriously unless youre willing to take that step
5825810 almost more dismaying is the response of some outside afghanistan who react by calling for a disengagement or the full withdrawal of international forces this would be a misjudgment of historic proportions the repetition of a mistake that has already had terrible consequences
5825811 we cannot return to a pre 8 19 world any more than we can return to a pre 9 11 one neither the blue flag nor the red cross is enough to protect humanitarians in an age of terror
5825812 the afghans do not support this so called insurgency they are its primary targets chayes writes
5825813 neither the forces fighting the afghan government nor ordinary people make any distinction between international humanitarian workers the afghan government and international military forces all are seen as part of the same system
5825814 the vast majority of regular folk desire the presence of these interlocking groups anti government forces however are just as hostile to aid workers as they are to soldiers or government officials the only place as dangerous to be as a nato military convoy is a clearly marked humanitarian vehicle
5825815 developing strategies to improve the prediction and diagnoses of dementia has paramount therapeutic and public health implications
5825816 when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy normative samples to determine cognitive impairment however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5825817 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of incident dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period mean average 3 3 years
5825818 on the basis of the consensus clinical diagnostic procedures 47 participants developed incident dementia of the alzheimer type and 18 participants developed incident vascular dementia during the study 128 individuals died as expected for the age of this cohort of these 18 had developed incident dementia
5825819 observational studies have demonstrated that the concentration of total homocysteine in blood is associated with risk of coronary artery disease and stroke
5825820 to evaluate the effects of homocysteine lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin b12 on mortality and cardiovascular events
5825821 mean average plasma total homocysteine concentration was reduced by 30 percent after 1 year of treatment in the groups receiving folic acid and vitamin b12
5825822 during a median midpoint 38 months of follow up the primary end point was experienced by a total of 422 participants 13 7 percent 219 participants 14 2 percent receiving folic acid vitamin b12 vs 203 13 1 percent not receiving such treatment and 200 participants 13 0 percent receiving vitamin b6 vs 222 14 3 percent not receiving vitamin b6
5825823 the potential role of arsenic in diabetes development is supported by experimental and mechanistic evidence
5825824 from a public health perspective confirmation of a role for arsenic in diabetes development would add to the concerns posed by the carcinogenic cardiovascular developmental and reproductive effects of inorganic arsenic in drinking water and could substantially modify risk assessment and risk benefit analyses estimating the consequences of arsenic exposure
5825825 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
5825826 stemming the pandemic of type 2 diabetes is a public health priority and will require a multifaceted approach
5825827 this must include improving the understanding of the etiology of diabetes and identifying modifiable factors that can be incorporated into prevention strategies
5825828 to date this approach has focused on medication and lifestyle modification but the role of environmental exposures must also be considered
5825829 while many questions remain about the role of arsenic in diabetogenesis they can only be answered by additional research
5825830 in the meantime arsenic exposure from drinking water is a widespread environmental pollutant that affects millions of individuals around the world
5825831 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched
5825832 with my macs and apple software i can pay attention to the work rather than trying to get the computer to work
5825833 they froze up regardless of how much memory i installed or whether i was using a desktop or laptop
5825834 i never have any problems with macs when you want to do something you do it and everything happens just the way you expect it to
5825835 i dont think its ethical to call it photography if you clone the image and cut and paste parts when you do that after the fact its design not photography
5825836 in aperture 2 things are just quicker to find than in the previous version
5825837 importing photographs and then finding them later is a much more intuitive task and the new version is faster allowing me to scan through my images more quickly
5825838 at first the temperature never went above 30 c sweat froze on our skin it was desolate
5825839 it was a lifesaver especially when youre stuck in a sleeping bag in a freezing tent
5825840 but one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same

5825843 duh thats what happens when you lose a war against a much larger neighboring foe they tend to ya know take your stuff and refuse to leave
5825844 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
5825845 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
5825846 most american leaders since world war ii have felt a need to demonstrate their willingness to shed blood to protect or advance what they construe as the national interest

5825856 if you are a dog and your owner suggests that you wear a sweater suggest that he wear a tail
5825857 the more people i meet the more i like my dog

5825860 college student experience of mental health service use and psychiatric medication
5825861 university mental health providers have observed increased numbers of students visiting college mental health centers
5825862 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes
5825863 while prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal these findings add to the existing concerns about the long term health consequences of low and moderate exposure to inorganic arsenic
5825864 vap is a relatively common infection and increasingly one caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria
5825865 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
5825866 prevention strategies often focus on modifiable risk factors for colonization and aspiration and can successfully reduce ventilator associated pneumonia rates but no single strategy completely eliminates ventilator associated pneumonia
5825867 adherence to prevention guidelines is variable due to costs and lack of education resources and leadership
5825868 in conclusion the results of this large randomized multicenter study demonstrated that the silver coated endotracheal tube significantly reduced the incidence of microbiologically confirmed ventilator associated pneumonia and had its greatest benefit during the peak time of ventilator associated pneumonia occurrence without any notable adverse events
5825869 the silver coated endotracheal tube appears to offer a unique approach because it is the first intervention that becomes user dependent after intubation requiring no further action by the clinician
5825870 based on the results of this trial should clinicians reconsider guidelines for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and use a silver coated endotracheal tube in all patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation in the icu
5825871 the answer is probably yes for the subset of patients at very high risk of developing early onset ventilator associated pneumonia such as neurologically impaired patients or trauma patients because the greatest effect of the intervention appeared to occur during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation and was clinically relevant with minimal effect on clinician workload
5825872 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit of silver coated endotracheal tubes
5825873 consequently silver coated tubes should not be viewed as the definitive answer for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and until additional data confirm the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of these devices their issue should be restricted to high risk patients treated in icus with benchmark value based infection rates that remain above institutional goals despite implementation of a comprehensive strategy of usual preventive measures to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia

5825878 what shes done is show people you can stand up to bush and its not the end of the world
5825879 she reminded the rank and file here not only do we matter but were an equal branch of government and she reminded the president were no longer a cheap date
5825880 shes got a hot hand right now we want to make sure she keeps that momentum going
5825881 i think that the president has finally realized that the leverage has changed
5825882 that is the question who has the leverage i think the president realizes now that we do
5825883 the iraqi government has been grotesquely irresponsible with the money we have given them
5825884 we should not be beholden to the french for parts and maintenance for the defense of our nation
5825885 and we should not require our military personnel to learn to speak french to be able to operate our refueling tankers
5825886 i wont be wronged i wont be insulted and i wont be laid a hand on i dont do these things to other people and i require the same from them
5825887 i want you to know who is to blame for this conflict and thats mr saakashvili who started this war and who is an aggressor 2000 people were killed in one day
5825888 i wanted the americans to know that russia didnt start that war

5825939 this year alone the leadership in congress has proposed to spend 22 billion more than my budget provides now some of them claim thats not really much of a difference the scary part is they seem to mean it
5825940 with todays veto the president has shown once again how out of touch and out of step he is with the values of americas families

5825951 it is supposed to overwhelm just as it would if you stood in the room with them
5825952 why should i stand in the way of something that impacts all residents of montgomery
5825953 id probably advise the next county executive not to have a department of homeland security
5825954 we dont want them swaggering around trying to figure out whether osama is in the house at the little falls library
5825955 the decision was made to fund it through september 30
5825956 because we did not know how long the surge would last
5825957 we did not know what the level of activity would be past october 1 so we have nothing in the budget
5825958 there definitely will be a cost because quite obviously at this point i mean all those troops will not be out on october 1
5825959 until we get more clarity in terms of exactly what the commitment will be in iraq
5825960 that will be the basis of our funding going forward
5825961 those of us who support what were doing still need to know how much it costs
5825962 i mean its good practice to dont start building until you know what it costs
5825963 im not sure we know what that troop level would be in a year frankly much less all the way out to 2017
5825964 in times of change learners inherit the earth while the learned find themselves equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists
5825965 so i am there always on my toes trying to pay attention to make sure the path they are heading down is consistent with the contract
5825966 i realized theres not going to be light around the corner
5825967 i could work 24 7 and would not catch up
5825968 the acquisition workforce couldnt be in any more distress right now and i know they are frustrated that they cant oversee the contracts that they have
5825969 they are looking at the hunks of money flowing out but dont have the bodies to keep up
5825970 two things the president doesnt want are new threats or even a new attack at a time when he has two chairs empty next to him that doesnt look good
5825971 has provided him with a clear understanding of the dangers we face and the importance of ensuring that we have the necessary tools to protect america
5825972 while i am sorry to lose ken as part of my leadership team i can think of no better choice to serve as the presidents homeland security adviser
5825973 his background in electronic surveillance and human intelligence in the form of informants has translated well
5825974 he spent many years running large scale investigations and brings to the job many things that only come from being a line prosecutor
5825975 is an inherently conservative system built to prevent sudden change
5825976 you spend a lot of time fending off people who have one specific thing they want to get done and dont care about the larger mission
5825977 yes someone may get hurt in some way so the argument becomes lets not do it
5825978 the unwillingness of political leaders to make an investment now when the benefits wont accrue until later
5825979 the model is dont do anything until theres a catastrophe when theres a catastrophe find someone to punish then move on
5825980 if you become paralyzed and try to make everyone happy you will certainly not progress to the goal and will end up making everyone unhappy
5825981 the real possibility of making this headquarters a reality gets very dim
5825982 since the president proposed cutting or eliminating essential homeland security programs for first responders transit and rail security and port security we made a decision to rearrange the homeland security budget so that these important priorities were not shortchanged
5825983 listened hard to the states concerns about possible costs and disruptions to their licensing procedures and we are going to make changes in response to those concerns and still provide the security the country expects
5825984 dhs is doing back flips in order to get states to say they are complying with real id
5825985 it was flawed in principle from the beginning and dhs is attempting a hail mary pass to try to coerce and convince states that what they are doing under existing statutes is acceptable
5825986 is doing its very best to manage the trade offs between security travel facilitation cost for states and practical consideration in implementation
5825987 as far as im concerned the department of homeland security and the administration have declared war on new york
5825988 its a knife in the back to new york and im going to do everything i can to make them very sorry they made this decision
5825989 we have to understand that there is risk throughout the nation
5825990 we worked very hard to make sure that there was fairness in the process
5825991 its not something that we felt could be fixed without some massive overhaul we think texas is really better served without it

5825995 at around 10 00am i saw a yellow truck approach the gate as the person in charge i directed a junior officer to search it and find out what the occupants wanted
5825996 i declined and told him as politely as i could that i did not have the key and that i had to ask for it from someone within the building when i told him that he shifted aim to my colleague who was too stunned to talk
5825997 the person who answered the phone thought i was joking i told him we had been taken hostage at the gate and he just laughed it off
5825998 at some point he asked me what drugs i was high on
5825999 for a moment i was scared all i could think of was my family i begged him to spare our lives at that point he was becoming desperate and headed to his driver one more time
5826000 the man saw me move away and started shooting he shot at me three times luckily none of the bullets found their mark
5826001 he looks at you says hi but cannot recall your name only the faces
5826002 hospital officials told me the security forces thwarted plans to kill me
5826003 from time to time i still hear the bomb going off in my head and whenever i report for duty i remember my colleagues who did not make it out alive
5826004 he must have left me alive for some reason and for that i continue serving him
5826005 they even gave me an award but my own people do not see me as a hero

5826025 i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing into self pity sometimes and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5826026 i love living and really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming yeah ill face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been so knowing that in my soul gave me the strength to say i have to get out there and make this positive
5826027 respect for the democratic and constitutional processes is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5826028 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5826029 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5826030 everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the state of emergency that he declared but he kept to his word he took off the uniform and its now a democratic government in pakistan
5826031 these are issues that theyre going to have to work through their political process
5826032 this is a fight that they are in as well
5826033 so were all in this together and the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that
5826034 we want to help the people of pakistan get through their food emergency and the concern they have and that we have over the economic condition of pakistan and so were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5826035 we had a good look at what went wrong in january and we learnt from that better plans more resources
5826036 as a result of the partnership and hard work of our local first responders and state agencies maryland received more funding in each of these competitive grant programs this year than last year and more than 8 million more than in the previous year overall
5826037 although the available funds are still far less than marylands overall needs the increase will provide much needed support
5826038 terrorists are always looking for soft targets so we should train people better to deal with terrorists every little bit of funding helps
5826039 weve been very concerned about the what ifs and what could happen in charles county
5826040 we just feel very strongly that theyre trying to put too many bodies into too small a space
5826041 we will save most of the historic buildings and we will reuse them
5826042 but we cannot do that if we dont have a client to justify
5826043 these are bracketing the negotiations for the next few months
5826044 such penalty is so disproportionate to the basis for the action as to be wholly without justification
5826045 will make it more difficult for dhs employees to challenge actions taken against them
5826046 plainly put we need to know who is in charge at dhs its managers and workers or the contractors
5826047 this heavy reliance on contractors raises the risk that dhs is not creating the institutional knowledge needed to be able to judge whether contractors are performing as they should and at a fair price
5826048 the risk that government decisions may be influenced by rather than independent from contractor judgments
5826049 there should be no uncertainty about our appreciation for and commitment to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars
5826050 this objective will be very difficult to achieve and it is far too early to place progress on a timeline for completion
5826051 we did the orientation but we didnt do the swearing in
5826052 the expanding military capabilities of chinas armed forces are a major factor in changing east asian military balances
5826053 improvements in chinas strategic capabilities have ramifications far beyond the asia pacific region
5826054 could also indicate planning for preemptive military options in advance of regional crises
5826055 with this bill well be keeping our promises to the families of 9 11
5826056 have been addressed and the president will sign the legislation
5826057 with this bill well be keeping our promises to the families of 9 11 well be honoring the work of the 9 11 commission and well be making the american people safer
5826058 while not perfect is another step in the right direction building on the steps of the previous five years
5826059 its reasonable it has the virtue of identifying a short list of priorities and of pushing hard without firmly mandating something that may not be necessary or practical
5826060 it keeps homeland security in the conversation when it would be all too easy to let it slide over issues like iraq immigration and domestic politics
5826061 in times of change learners inherit the earth while the learned find themselves equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists
5826062 it is in the transition period when people are doing the handoff that there is a natural degree of confusion which creates an invitation to people to carry out terrorist attacks or other damaging enterprises
5826063 jay ahern is a career civil servant with over 30 years of experience
5826064 having him as the no 2 now and as acting commissioner during the transition makes me feel pretty good
5826065 to not have them distracted at all by the transition
5826066 to ensure that people maintain their focus on the mission
5826067 i would be lying if i didnt say i would be disappointed if i werent there when it happened
5826068 obviously none of us would have wanted fran to leave service
5826069 dedicated 110 percent of her time and effort to making sure that american citizens could live free from terror
5826070 he turns to her as a kind of go to person
5826071 we know that al qaeda views these periods with a particular focus
5826072 we will be prepared to begin that transfer to a new president and his or her team beginning right after the election
5826073 i dont endorse giving licenses to people who are not here legally but federal law does allow states to make that choice
5826074 i think it was one of the dumbest and most inappropriate things ive seen since ive been in government
5826075 i have made unambiguously clear in anglo saxon prose that it is not to ever happen again and there will be appropriate disciplinary action taken against those people who exhibited what i regard as extraordinarily poor judgment
5826076 without the numeric id itd be nearly impossible to map text to database ids
5826077 the donors only concerns regarding the collection are due to personnel information that could include names confidential salary information and even social security numbers
5826078 the furlough will negatively affect our ability to execute base operations and training activities
5826079 more importantly it will affect the critical support our civilian employees provide to our warfighters support which is key to our current operations in both afghanistan and iraq
5826080 unnecessarily bringing up the specter of furloughs and terminations especially around the holiday season lowers morale and threatens to push employees with needed expertise into retirement
5826081 lockheed martin stands ready to support our air force customer and their requirements in whatever way they request
5826082 he always disliked the program and thought it was a cold war plane
5826083 he thought it was a plane optimized for the soviet threat but not for the future
5826084 our military families serve our nation they inspire our nation and tonight our nation honors them
5826085 it has some merit to it i dont have any idea what it costs thats been one of the problems in the past
5826086 thats not the only inconsistency or contradiction in his budget by any means the budget overstates revenues and understates expenditures in a big way
5826087 it is a good idea and we are trying to determine the cost and put together a proposal
5826088 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5826089 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5826090 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5826091 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5826092 harm u s forces in the region or undercut israels qualitative military advantage
5826093 significant arms sales prolonged military training programs material pre positioning and basing arrangements joint exercises and direct military interventions have characterized u s policy toward the gulf region
5826094 discussion on securing key sites in spite of historic sensitivities regarding sovereignty and foreign participation in the regional energy industry
5826095 southern gulf arms sales will be 50 to 100 percent higher over the next four years
5826096 continue to reach out to iranian leaders to avoid the appearance of siding as a consolidated bloc with the united states against their gulf neighbor
5826097 why cant my technology be as easy to use as my garage door opener
5826098 one button and it opens or shuts the door simple elegant
5826099 theres no question that at least a medium term if not a long term challenge is for us to settle on a final location for the department
5826100 at this point were focused on building our organic strategy
5826101 the ability to talk to a search engine is perhaps the simplest its ever been
5826102 those are the three things that i believe are going to cause search to change
5826103 you can see that today in what we have done with image search what we have done with video search
5826104 to say that were not a media company would be hypocrisy
5826105 ive not been successful in finding the right price and the right camera on
5826106 i could see live search was different the fact that its different i think means its going to have some potential
5826107 theres a fine line between an attitude problem and thinking clearly
5826108 we are counting on significant revenues from u s government contractors for the foreseeable future a decline in security related government spending or a shift away from programs we address could hurt our sales put pressure on our prices and reduce our revenues and margins
5826109 experienced a turnover of more than half its senior employees through resignation or transfer to another executive branch department
5826110 a walled off citadel on the site is not going to help
5826111 id like to see anything on the site but homeland security
5826112 it has a lot of potential for building the community a community of residents on this side of the river
5826113 the only developer in the u s that consistently puts up money for historic properties is the federal government
5826114 clearly we have a long way to go before the department achieves the goals we set out for it four and a half years ago
5826115 pick up the pace with so much at stake and so many areas where progress is still required america cannot settle for a mixed report card
5826116 no one would have been bold enough to predict that six years would pass without a further successful attack on the homeland
5826117 determined that new commercial products now offer similar functionality while costing significantly less to maintain than advise
5826118 congress has banned this type of program with good reason
5826119 the judgments about americans calculated by ats will be stored for years and we have no idea how they may be used in the future the benefit to the government is extremely questionable but the consequences for americans are simply dangerous
5826120 like other data mining applications the advise tool could misidentify or erroneously associate an individual with undesirable activity such as fraud crime or terrorism
5826121 they couldnt trust him to write tax policy so why should he be given access to our nations top secrets or making policy for national defense
5826122 members of the committee have access to intelligence secrets plots here in the country overseas and people under suspicion this shows how unimportant the democrats think homeland security is
5826123 at that time the homeland security phrase wasnt even in the lexicon
5826124 none of us could have imagined wed be where we are today
5826125 i understand the grant process i understand some of the rationales and the thinking behind the grant process
5826126 are we on the right path in terms of what were doing
5826127 no matter how well we put together our application i think at the federal level theres a limited amount of funding dollars
5826128 my main focus is to make sure we have a really well trained and educated professional homeland security and emergency management agency
5826129 lacks sufficient authority to direct the type of sustained leadership and overarching management integration and transformation strategy that is needed department wide
5826130 extensive executive level leadership and management experience in the public or private sector
5826131 no matter how good the tourniquet is if you cant get it on the person at the right time it doesnt work
5826132 its something that is so basic so cost effective and so overwhelmingly life changing
5826133 tourniquets have allowed many people with devastating injuries to come back that in another time and another place would have died
5826134 if you can save a medic a few minutes of time so he can concentrate on saving your life it has great possibilities
5826135 the way wars are fought now theres no defined lines of engagement
5826136 the average cook could be hit with a rocket attack while hes carrying potatoes to the mess hall
5826137 we are confident that the day that this hits the field that lives will be saved
5826138 this is the most careful deliberative selection of a major weapons system that the air force has undertaken in modern times
5826139 a lot of damage can be done by people with misinformation
5826140 all that means is our work is harder we need to work more to get our message out
5826141 we can learn from each other and this is gods plan
5826142 who died and made you the crossdressing king of justice
5826143 kill kill kill kill kill the trolls hunt them down there will be no clemency kill kill kill kill killl the trolls look under the bridges for thats where they hide
5826144 zasto phelps nije osvojio 8 zlata jer sutra i prekosutra ima jos 2 discipline
5826145 ovo je jako jako lose depresivan glas ne nece tako ici ovo je vrlo lose jako jako tuzno tuzno lose lose nije dobro
5826146 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
5826147 typical protection for cargo utility trailers is a padlock which can be defeated with a bolt cutter or other theft
5826148 why would they choose to run these tests in africa
5826149 sooner or later you are going to learn just as i did that there is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path
5826150 why dont we just leave this room today forgetting the word earmark
5826151 this is a way for members to come together sometimes in a bipartisan way to have the congress of the united states determine some of what is in the appropriations bills instead of just leaving it up to the white house
5826152 we will never have a vote on any earmark and that is simply wrong
5826153 the democrats came to power promising greater openness and transparency withholding earmarks while hundreds of billions of dollars in spending bills are debated makes a mockery of that process
5826154 shouldnt force half baked appropriations bills on the house floor just to make an arbitrary timeline
5826155 we spent the last five months cleaning up your spilled milk
5826156 it is not that we didnt want to include them its that our staff did not have the capacity to screen all of them before we brought the bills out
5826157 we had to spend the first month dealing with last years republican budgets we had to do two years of work in one
5826158 holding up an important homeland security bill in hopes of making a political point is more likely to make the country angry at them not us
5826159 we have to watch closely on the earmarks and to see what the eventual action is
5826160 it is very hard to tell especially on the house side what are the plans for earmarks
5826161 at the present time the evidence suggests dhs is not keeping employees committed to the organization
5826162 did not provide evidence performance ratings were reviewed by appropriate leadership to ensure accuracy and consistency in ratings
5826163 the program a corporate goal rather than an hr human resources initiative
5826164 this would provide higher visibility and help keep senior leaders engaged
5826165 this bill contains very tough provisions to protect national security including the ability for cfius to reopen reviews when companies dont comply with mitigation agreements designed to reduce security risks
5826166 were now in another year where the president has sort of said one thing in the state of the union but the reality of the budget is very different
5826167 this years budget fails to acknowledge the role that the national capital region and maryland plays in protecting our nation from future attacks
5826168 when you factor in that 1 billion with the rest of the totals its roughly about the same as what the allocations were last year
5826169 got to make everything balance out congress will get its two cents in
5826170 a wake up call for the leadership that we have to pay attention to these basic communication skills
5826171 we have a lot of work to do to understand where we have these problems
5826172 the us and eu had no right to stand against russia as it was defending russian citizens from georgian attacks
5826173 young currently lives on a 1500 acre 6 km ranch in la honda california called broken arrow he also owns property in fort lauderdale florida and on the islands of hawaii
5826174 hey it is not the heat it is the humidity
5826175 i knew it was going to happen before it happened i seen him coming and i hit my brake lights i had my four ways on and i just dont know he never seen them
5826176 a persons life has such a great value that we cannot take it we are not the owners
5826177 it is not a philosophical debate it is mostly about the criminality should you or should you not be penalizing it
5826178 there isnt a way to measure this what was clandestine is now authorized we dont know what the measure is outside these medical units
5826179 if something happens your family or you have legal grounds to allege negligence
5826180 what this suggests is that procedures in clandestine areas have disappeared and given way to this
5826181 it will be a model at least in that it can show the way to other countries
5826182 its such an injustice these poor women are punished in every sense of the word
5826183 in 2004 we were kind of disassociated with everyone because we were staying on a ship and not with everyone in the olympic village
5826184 weve gone to the village a lot and ate in the cafeteria weve taken a million and three pictures and signed a million and three autographs everyone is living it up its totally different from 2004 when i did not get to experience the olympic experience
5826185 everyone on this team wants to be with the other athletes and if we could stay in the village 24 7 and have some privacy we would
5826186 some guy will walk up and say hey carlos great season last year and im like arent you an australian water polo player how do you know about me im having a blast
5826187 it was quite difficult in athens federer said of the 2004 olympics
5826188 taking the bus and not being in control of my own schedule and many people recognizing me in the village it was not as enjoyable as sydney which i loved
5826189 its very different from the regular tournaments on the tour you are in the olympic village so its always very nice to be with the rest of the sportsmen of the world
5826190 the reason i won this title is probably because i had a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village thank you to the other spanish athletes for coming to support me it was an amazing experience
5826191 i did some photos i did some autographs but always was a pleasure because i did with another sportsman thats always a very good feeling have a photo with another sportsman like me no
5826192 im getting to know the german handball team and the mens and womens field hockey teams and our table tennis and track athletes
5826193 at the hotel it seemed like every other tournament blake said
5826194 thats what we usually do go from the hotel to the courts
5826195 i can deal with the smaller quarters the sharing the rooms i lived in dorms in college its not a big deal to me food same thing dining hall we always get mcdonalds you can get something you know i love it there
5826196 generally im just as impressed with the person im taking the picture with as they are with me
5826197 quite a few of the tennis players are staying in hotels but i dont understand why theyre doing that
5826198 having made the decision to play in the olympics i wouldnt want to be staying anywhere other than in the athletes village
5826199 check this out that little speck is going to go bang and then in 13 7 billion years theres going to be a large group of people which will claim i did it in 7 days for some reason
5826200 you can get a message in a bunker with a pager a hurricane can go through and youll get the message with a pager
5826201 wow that warning is specific as hell what sick mind in legal dreamed this up and decided that it rose above the disclaimer threshold
5826202 some knucklehead not in legal actually tried this at home and sued the company when it didnt work out
5826203 for the avoidance of doubt in the event of a breach of rule 4 under no circumstances shall a poll worker cast a ballot in his home
5826204 theres nothing new here the president has the authority to choose which of his subordinate officers hell rely on
5826205 the president has the authority to determine what the relationship is between them
5826206 amazingly president bush continues to show more interest in expanding his executive power than in running the government in a fair effective and competent manner
5826207 davis hopes the white house isnt saying they dont understand the need for minimal qualifications or that they might bypass them
5826208 davis spokesman david marin said in a reference to bushs early praise for brown
5826209 good luck getting someone confirmed who doesnt meet these standards
5826210 congress needs a forthright assessment of the state of the nations preparedness from the fema director
5826211 this is actually a very significant milestone in regional preparedness
5826212 trying to bring all these folks and cultures to the table is not an easy task but its an essential task
5826213 when something bad happens this is not the document you pick up to figure out what to do
5826214 our story from the beginning has been you need to be able to know what monies have been available and what theyve been spent on
5826215 all these plans are great but i think weve got to communicate what we have done to the general public
5826216 24 and americas image in fighting terrorism fact fiction or does it matter
5826217 said the soul patched actor whose character last season was apparently killed no next season plot spoilers here
5826218 it could be completely realistic or it could be entertainment which do you want
5826219 what the show tries to do is capture an emotional and psychological reality of living in a world where terrorism is a threat if youre looking to us for realistic advice on how to fight terrorism were all in real trouble
5826220 i said it on the panel and i meant it that acting allows you to stay inside a fantasy world but this is very bizarre i dont know what to think im really beside myself and speechless to be here
5826221 when i go into the apple store i try to use the image to get free stuff
5826222 it is something i do think needs some significant attention
5826223 we cant have 218 different reactions and 218 different speakers for those agencies
5826224 has been okay but not as effective as we had hoped
5826225 it was never assigned an operational ability which is a weakness were seeing right now
5826226 i cannot provide a monetary value however the number of passengers carried indicates a very positive revenue result
5826227 the us australian and new zealand routes were the most heavily traveled during this month
5826228 the result indicates a strong level of recovery in tourism inflows to fiji and revenue improvement for the airline which will help to offset some of the very high fuel costs experienced
5826229 but we do not expect them to exceed the july results
5826230 it looks to the order of 95 000 customers for this month depending upon the final level of bookings taken over the next two weeks
5826231 the forward bookings for september are showing quite a positive rate of intake but beyond that the pattern is a little confused so it is too early to say that a tourism recovery has been established
5826232 i think they did the right thing for the department the employees and the country we are looking forward to working with them on the priorities for the department
5826233 this decision is okay with the department of homeland security because it allows us to move forward toward implementing labor relations flexibility rather than spending additional time in litigation
5826234 we will continue to engage with our components and partners in the unions to consider all options in moving forward
5826235 will approach the next round of discussions with an open mind
5826236 precaution against any members of the plot who may still be at large
5826237 by all accounts and measures the warning system seems to have worked well this time its a big step away from the early stages of the system
5826238 heres a case where the dots seem to be connected very well and very carefully
5826239 catching potential terrorist attacks at the last minute should not be a point of pride but rather a point of departure
5826240 reminds us of the failure of the bush administration to improve our homeland security including aviation security
5826241 its a continuation of the aspiration i have that our nation have access to the best possible resources to fight terror whether domestic or international
5826242 we need checks and balances to match that paradigm shift
5826243 what network analysis technology does is not look at the individual but rather at the gravity and weight of relationships between people who appear to be doing something harmful to our interests or in opposition to the law
5826244 most of it quite frankly is a lot of political theater
5826245 if you had to rank the top five issues that americans were concerned about they seem to be the ones that congress is acting on at the same time they are the top five issues that congress and the administration have failed to act on for three or four years
5826246 and to be honest i dont know if theyre acting on them
5826247 but if thats the only thing that we do its going to be very very hard to sustain it
5826248 meeting the challenge of 9 11 blueprints for more effective government
5826249 reorganization is not a cure of poor coordination and can make matters worse at least during the shake down period
5826250 with respect to fighting terrorism overseas there is recognition of the value of depending on professional career military leaders who serve under a small number of political policy leaders in washington why should professional career leadership be any less critical for protecting our homeland against terrorism
5826251 it is essential that the management of homeland security not be politicized
5826252 the core departments and agencies are in many instances hollow with an over reliance upon third parties to perform both operational and management responsibilities
5826253 theyve won a license to hunt the work has to come later
5826254 we wanted to try to bring those in house to some degree
5826255 the extremely large amount of money involved with these contracts partnered with lack of oversight and quality control is a prescription for more waste fraud and abuse
5826256 we think it is better when there is one voice for employees
5826257 our record visibility and effectiveness is what employees see and that is what they want
5826258 so i have a job to do a job to complete in that sense yes i would like to run
5826259 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing on its own and living off its own means
5826260 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5826261 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country
5826262 does not have a properly functional government yet it must get that
5826263 the reason we are still around is because of the immense resilience of the afghan people and their goodheartedness toward the presence of the international community
5826264 other than that activities like breaking into homes would have gotten us into serious trouble a long time back
5826265 so i have a job to do a job to complete in that sense yes i would like to run
5826266 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing on its own and living off its own means
5826267 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5826268 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country
5826269 does not have a properly functional government yet it must get that
5826270 the reason we are still around is because of the immense resilience of the afghan people and their goodheartedness toward the presence of the international community
5826271 other than that activities like breaking into homes would have gotten us into serious trouble a long time back

5826280 i think what theyre enjoying thats different is having all the time and money they need to make a game because this is a studio thats been scraping by
5826281 being told just spend three months coming up with ideas then saying take six months to get a playable up gives them time to get it right and theyre loving it
5826282 players expect more than before the game is already half done right but most sequels have less development time and indeed we didnt get much pre production time its really hard to eke out pre production time for a sequel the lesson is to compete in novelty not size
5826283 one have the best guns two have the most guns three sell guns

5826291 what good is it my brothers if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds can such faith save him suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food if one of you says to him go i wish you well keep warm and well fed but does nothing about his physical needs what good is it in the same way faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead but someone will say you have faith i have deeds show me your faith without deeds and i will show you my faith by what i do you believe that there is one god good even the demons believe that and shudder you foolish man do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless was not our ancestor abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son isaac on the altar you see that his faith and his actions were working together and his faith was made complete by what he did and the scripture was fulfilled that says abraham believed god and it was credited to him as righteousness and he was called gods friend you see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone in the same way was not even rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without deeds is dead
5826292 paragon guns do not belong to dhs nor are they under the control of dhs
5826293 the inability to obtain quality goods and services on time and at a fair price
5826294 the boys made an effort to return the property to the owner the following day
5826295 i and others here spent lots of hours trying to figure out who took this merchandise the action of these individuals has caused a disappointing situation all around anytime someone takes something of value its not a harmless prank
5826296 a huge amount to drink 10 or 11 drinks apiece
5826297 i have serious concerns that allowing you to remain at the workplace would jeopardize the security of the traveling public
5826298 in the midst of so many important things going on in the world homeland security spends five months investigating this
5826299 it was just a stupid spur of the moment prank
5826300 but the way things are now they dont care what kind of person i was or how good my work record was im just tired of waiting i wish theyd either fire us or punish us and let us get back to work
5826301 my pointing out the security gaps that i was finding did not make me popular in the department of homeland security
5826302 any one of those containers could contain a weapon of mass destruction
5826303 instead of taking the terrorists on he would take me on
5826304 by any measure the department has proved to be less than the sum of its parts
5826305 i am concerned this high turnover undermines the departments effectiveness
5826306 it could also very well weaken our efforts to integrate the departments many agencies and further erode employee morale
5826307 were making sure we push the dollars out the door under a consolidated approach
5826308 the funding priority is going to continue as it has in the past
5826309 were not talking about an either or equation were talking about an and approach
5826310 give me a business card ill make sure they call you
5826311 we have concluded that fema is in shambles and beyond repair and that it should be abolished
5826312 do nothing to solve the key problems that katrina has revealed including a lack of resources and weak and ineffective leadership
5826313 the president failed to provide critical leadership when it was most needed and that contributed to a grossly ineffective federal response to hurricane katrina
5826314 removing fema from dhs would only exacerbate the agencys problems
5826315 i did my job but the departments leaders have not done theirs
5826316 was on his schedule and as far as i know he was there
5826317 president uribe said he would consider having colombian workers have microchips implanted into their bodies before they are permitted to enter the united states to work on a seasonal basis
5826318 i doubted whether the implantation of microchips would be effective
5826319 since the immigrant worker might be able to remove them
5826320 my conscious dictates that i dont be part of anything that is unconstitutional
5826321 i cant believe you said that thats like a scene out of mans search for happiness where the lady chooses the doll instead of eternal life
5826322 but we cant go to the infinite atonement it comes to us
5826323 no were going to the gay dog handling theology class its called
5826324 instead of moving people onto it quicker it is going to be slightly slower
5826325 the plan is not to go out and do massive harm to employees of this department quite the contrary
5826326 it is to give them a clearer picture of how they succeed and better recognition for that success it is not a machiavellian plot
5826327 in the end the departments goal is the same as the employees goal
5826328 you want to be able to have high quality people in the organization who succeed in their job and want to stay for the long run that is what employees want and that is what the department wants
5826329 the ncr leadership and homeland security partners have made significant progress since last july
5826330 we have developed the framework of the 2005 update to the ncr hls strategic plan which includes the mission vision guiding principles strategic goals objectives and initiatives
5826331 by studying gap analyses and self assessments we have agreed to designate 16 of the 45 initiatives as priority granting them primary status as we have approached the 2006 hls grant cycle in the coming months we plan to invest in maturing the 45 initiatives focusing on the development of performance measures and timelines to ensure the effective implementation of these initiatives
5826332 im having a tough time trying to dig through this testimony
5826333 there are 180 000 dedicated men and women in this department who make the country safer every day i am proud to have been part of that
5826334 deserves the nations thanks for helping to secure our homeland
5826335 simply adds to the challenges for a department already operating with far too many vacant senior positions
5826336 but i am also hopeful this helps highlight the pressing need for comprehensive legislation to strengthen the departments management and operations
5826337 did express some willingness to listen to concerns of employees
5826338 it is high time they admit that maxhr is not going anywhere good and is not going to be a success for the department
5826339 had an open door policy but unfortunately many of the problems we brought through that open door were never resolved and in a larger sense the problems in dhs will certainly continue long after ms hales departure we wish her well
5826340 because we can provide a secure environment they are looking at over time relocating components of dhs
5826341 dhs itself is still in the process of figuring out what components to locate there
5826342 our concern has been about whether the amount of square footage could fit on the property given the constraints of historic preservation
5826343 it was the president who acknowledged the response to hurricane katrina was insufficient and it was the president who first sought the lessons learned
5826344 i reject outright any suggestion that president bush was anything less than fully involved
5826345 i unequivocally and strongly reject this attempt to drive a wedge between our concerns about terrorism and our concerns about natural disasters
5826346 id probably advise the next county executive not to have a department of homeland security
5826347 we dont want them swaggering around trying to figure out whether osama is in the house at the little falls library

5826353 rivera carrion tested the limits of his skill and endurance while rescuing 269 survivors trapped on rooftops and balconies throughout new orleans and southwest louisiana

5826355 at all levels of government we must build a leadership corps that is fully educated trained and exercised in our plans and doctrine training is not nearly as costly as the mistakes made in a crisis
5826356 equally important this corps must be populated by leaders who are prepared to exhibit innovation and take the initiative during extremely trying circumstances
5826357 supports the rights of patrons to view the materials of their choice
5826358 libraries are not the hotbed of looking at porn sites
5826359 substantiate analyze and act on the information at its disposal
5826360 if 9 11 was a failure of imagination then katrina was a failure of initiative it was a failure of leadership
5826361 in this instance blinding lack of situational awareness and disjointed decision making needlessly compounded and prolonged katrinas horror
5826362 100 percent of everything that could be pre staged was pre staged
5826363 the circumstances created by hurricanes katrina and rita provide an unprecedented opportunity for fraud waste and abuse
5826364 while dhs is taking several steps to manage and control spending under katrina the sheer size of the response and recovery efforts will create an unprecedented need for oversight
5826365 retooling fema is one of our greatest and most urgent priorities
5826366 we continue to make programs more efficient effective and results oriented

5826370 the nation is sending 700 billion dollars every year overseas to countries that do not like us very much when i am president that is going to stop
5826371 but it is pretty clear from the policies hes advocating that hes literally over the barrel when it comes to the oil industry basically bought lock stock and barrel by the oil industry
5826372 we have to drill here and we have to drill now

5826381 ich habe nicht meinen verstand verloren ich wei genau wo ich ihn gelassen habe
5826382 the data indicate that federal agencies are taking seriously the requirement to develop rigorous appraisal systems and to make meaningful distinctions in performance ratings and pay
5826383 it really is unfortunate that they define progress as a decrease in those rated at the highest level
5826384 the decline in ratings reflects an improved reporting system not decreased performance
5826385 every dollar that is wasted on a contract is a dollar less that could be used to make americans more secure
5826386 this kind of abuse constitutes a security gap all its own in americas defense
5826387 is not understandable or justified all these years after the creation of the department
5826388 time and time again to take the department and thereby taxpayers for a ride
5826389 its hard to imagine that the report can criticize the department for a contract made before the department was created

5826396 this move didnt come out of the void but after many meetings away from media between representatives of hezbollah and some salafist groups

5826398 there is a historic suspicion that african americans are less patriotic

5826417 we envision transforming the facade of the long low parking garage into a lushly planted area that will provide a transition from the grit and noise of the elevated highway to the protected residential zones of the new development and the friendly pedestrian scaled streets of the ninth square for those who remember the coliseum high above route 34 the new garages planted facade and active green roof will be a revolutionary presence a new approach to city design that emphasizes health diversity and accessibility a symbol of new havens renaissance
5826418 would minimize potential visual impacts of the parking structure while marking the parking facilities convenient for the proposed uses
5826419 wonderful visibility from the major road arteries serving new haven superior access and close proximity to the various business health care and academic institutions

5826421 focused on the tenth square a group of streets plotted to the southeast between the harbor and the original market place i e the new haven green this square held the active mercantile quarter the long wharf pier which stretched to the harbor from the tenth square housed an extensive shipping industry which controlled new havens economy in the early federal period
5826422 a synergistic mix of uses based upon new urbanism principles designed to reduce impact on the envrionment city services and roads while maximizing taxes and jobs the development will be situated in a manner that respects the historic significance of the adjacent ninth square district yet integrates innovative methods of sustainable design a variety of public and open spaces from wide active sidewalks to commercial gathering places will contribute to the developments distinctive character providing a valuable amenity for the surrounding community
5826423 opportunity to resurrect from a failed urban renewal attempt the rich culture and diversity that once thrived in this former mixed use neighborhood

5826427 there is a strong viable market for housing in a dynamic urban center of culture and education an alternative to urban sprawl and resort communities adult americans are turning towards cities to provide them a stimulating pedestrian oriented life among neighbors and community our strategy is based upon the idea of bringing a new market of citizens into new haven
5826428 we are in a period of urban rediscovery and revitalization new haven is already a beneficiary of the renewed interest in the urban experience that is drawing people of all ages from the suburbs back to cities to visit work and to live our investigative research indicates that there is a strong market for adults who are seeking an alternative to suburban living and retirement communities at resort locations these studies indicate there is a critical mass of diverse well educated people seeking the vitality of close neighbors in an intimate campus like setting where they can own a townhouse or apartment
5826429 new haven offers stimulating culture and education excellent medical care great restaurants wonderful architecture and two railroad stations all within a short walk of the coliseum site we are proposing a village for alumni and others at the coliseum site we believe new havens future is in education culture and research we think there is a significant contribution that a group of two hundred homeowners can bring to this city in taxes volunteerism and purchasing power without burdening the public school system our research indicates that our targeted market group is engaged and civic minded

5826574 why it is that although the economic aspects of globalization trade aspects labour aspects the investment aspects the commercial arbitration aspects are well looked after human rights lag as an object of corporate attention
5826575 i believe there is an important role here for corporate canada and i hope a lot of you will do your best to get your clients to put their shoulder to the wheel
5826576 the interaction between the economies of the first world and the economies of the third world are growing your people have their act together the legal system doesnt progress is made in a patchwork kind of way there is no coherent legal structure
5826577 it is an enormous web of corporate activity across the globe which is not matched by any legal structure the global economy is divided into all these national jurisdictions that sometimes have a great deal of trouble and control is required
5826578 these countries compete ferociously for investment they compete for jobs they compete for ways to improve their standard of living and they are in no mood to bring down the hammer on companies which carry on in those jurisdictions differently than they do at home
5826579 there are people in the country who are fully supportive because they are looking for jobs or economic improvement but if you area mine or a pipeline people are going to be displaced and they are unlikely to get much compensation so you have internal conflict which the country inviting in the multinational sometimes represses with more violence than im sure the multinational in general regards as acceptable

5826586 i think im close to 100 percent im definitely good enough to compete and play
5826587 its great to be running around with my teammates instead of standing around wishing you were out there
5826588 rehabbing is something ill have to continue to do throughout my career whats important is to continue to use that time to make sure youre mentally sharp
5826589 i asked them why they are taking him they said they are preparing charges of terrorism sectarian killings and displacing people
5826590 my son is a humble man he does not deal with political things he only owns a shop of spare car parts
5826591 i wish american forces had captured him rather than the iraqi army once the iraqi army has him he will not be released
5826592 i almost didnt go out with him because he was so young but he was always trying to convince me he was so mature and he was its true my friends made fun of me and gave me the nickname stella from the movie how stella got her grove back about a woman who dates this younger guy but one of the reasons we got along was because we both loved hip hop and used to talk about the black eyed peas and how amazing they were
5826593 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5826594 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5826595 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time

5826651 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5826652 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5826653 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore

5826790 god cant be all powerful and all loving if he were this world wouldnt be the way it is
5826791 god i think i can do this without you ill just go this one alone but thanks for the offer
5826792 god isnt whats most important in life in fact id just as soon do it without him altogether
5826793 okay you dont want me around so im out of here but your world will not be the same without me
5826794 cursed is the ground because of you through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life by the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground since from it you were taken for dust you are and to dust you will return
5826795 god wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth
5826796 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
5826797 the lord is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance
5826798 for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the sovereign lord repent and live
5826799 i am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me will live even though he dies

5826801 social networking sites such as facebook are a fast growing phenomenon
5826802 social network users need to realise that the information and photos they put into cyberspace in some cases can be seen by others and can leave a digital tattoo that can be difficult to erase
5826803 the latest research from the us suggests 44 per cent of employers are now using sites like myspace and facebook to research job candidates
5826804 as a general rule its best not to publish information you would not want the world to know

5826812 it was right around when our third record come down came out and it was the first stop on our tour
5826813 its always exciting to see how a new album will be perceived
5826814 we spend years making a record how will people see it what will they get out of it interpretation is pretty cool
5826815 there are usually a few concepts floating around when we make a record but at the end of the day were there with one song at a time and only our gut instincts to guide us i think it was michelangelo who said he gets a chunk of marble and he starts chiseling away till he finds the statue thats how it is for me on a good day on the best day just trying to get the muck out of the way of the music
5826816 it was supposed to be our last with capitol records and didnt end up being on it we didnt plan on it being a fresh start
5826817 no fight no bad feelings just ok bye then i went on vacation for two months in europe my first vacation ever the dark cloud had lifted
5826818 and we have creative control over everything all our videos are shot at the odditorium we brought movie directors there its nice to help edit during rough cuts so that it turns out as good as we can possibly make it and were as happy as we can possibly be weve definitely earned it
5826819 we wanted to meet people with similar music taste to go drinking with
5826820 most people arent interested in exploring new sounds and only like whats given to them
5826821 i dont recall when the album title came about but it summed up where we were and our relationship to the world
5826822 some of these songs had titles and were kicking around since the beginning

5826832 theres definitely been an improvement but theyre still looking for something thats open until last call 2 a m
5826833 the feedback weve been getting the most is they wish we were open later
5826834 i think they need to start having a lot more bars like this so they can start attracting younger crowds
5826835 typically when you get a community thats growing that has the demographics that gilbert has those pieces start to fall in place
5826836 i think if gilbert wants to make a lot of money they should increase the places that are appealing to younger people and younger couples
5826837 i think there are more people in this town looking for things to do than people think
5826838 never say never but you really try to stay true to the vision
5826839 i think it would have to be a partnership kind of decision between us and the town if it would be the appropriate thing to do
5826840 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5826841 this nomination should be based on the criteria on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
5826842 if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5826843 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5826844 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
5826845 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
5826846 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
5826847 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be
5826848 i told her what happened she said ill call you back
5826849 a coach never feels you are as good as you can be but were close and its important for us just to focus on this moment and thats what im trying to get across to the guys and australia is that moment not anybody else
5826850 they have five or six nba players but we beat them in the last european championship so we believe we can do it again especially because they are not playing that well

5826853 i dont think for me coaching against his countrymen will be psychological because i did it before in 2004
5826854 they have a lot of experience maybe more than us
5826855 when you have all that experience you feel you can overcome anything
5826856 he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been
5826857 we are losing 25 000 a month we have lost almost 300 000 so far
5826858 we keep having complaints at the spa aafes has those complaints on record
5826859 money comes second the customers must be happy and satisfied with our service
5826860 a couple of us have been with this organization for six or seven years this is our third boss and nobody complained before that they didn t make money
5826861 i don t like it to look like we are lazy people who sit around and don t work
5826862 some of these people have been working here for years a lot of teachers come here so we really like it and it will be sad to see them go people are talking about it on base
5826863 the guys love it all you gotta do is go on one trip and you know how well the guys like it it s a chance for them to get away a chance for them to relax
5826864 in fact i saved the addresses and banking information of 1 5 million clients
5826865 tks customer data is maintained through our own secure customer care and billing system which is independently administered outside service providers such as deutsche telekom do not have access to sensitive tks customer information
5826866 apparently decided not to sell strong i e not 3 2 beer beer in oklahoma because of the convoluted nature of the states tiered distribution system
5826867 we need academic freedom and an ability to talk about these things without fearing legal consequences
5826868 the marketplace of ideas does not work when we have gag orders imposed on our scientists
5826869 now that the court proceedings are behind us i renew my invitation to the students to sit down with us and discuss their findings

5826871 he has done an unbelievable job coming from the environment that he came from
5826872 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5826873 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5826874 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5826875 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5826876 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5826877 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
5826878 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
5826879 this is cool coming out of a mexican american background it feels good to represent the u s
5826880 not too many mexicans get the chance to do that
5826881 he has done an unbelievable job coming from the environment that he came from
5826882 ellas not that interested in movies shed far rather be playing with her dolls and barbies but thats good i think thats healthy
5826883 securing a partnership with a global leader like thompson creek provides significant validation of both the lucky jack project and our strategy to realize value from this asset over the long term
5826884 thompson creek brings an outstanding environmental record substantial expertise financial resources and a singular focus on the development and operation of molybdenum projects to the table with an office in denver co operating mines in the u s and canada and substantial roasting capacity we believe that thompson creek is the ideal partner for the advancement of the project

5826888 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
5826889 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposures while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched
5826890 participants also reported problems navigating within the web site and locating information
5826891 suffice is to say that more research is probably needed to assess the usability of the site and should be performed by people who have a basic understanding of the size and complexity of the program
5826892 we understand fully the importance of the site to our beneficiaries their family members healthcare professionals and other stakeholders
5826893 indeed the site averages more than a million hits a day
5826894 worked hard to organize and format our quality compare tools for hospitals and nursing homes for example in a consumer friendly manner
5826895 we are constantly striving to improve our web sites inasmuch as we know how critical these resources are to our beneficiaries their family members and the healthcare community as a whole

5826898 the first place utilities look to save money is in labor

5826911 how are we supposed to lead our revolution if we arent united just because one walked on the others shoe grow up
5826912 the nursing staff had evaluated the patients nutrition the review revealed no nutritional consult was requested and revealed no evidence the physician was notified about the inadequate nutritional intake
5826913 they said he was lying down and didnt feel like talking
5826914 they wouldnt let me see him i think he died that day
5826915 the wind had filled in nicely of his port quarter and he was having an easy sail
5826916 of course because a yacht doesnt sail as the crow flies hes actually done more miles 1 048 miles to be exact
5826917 hes averaged five knots since leaving majuro yesterday over the previous 24 hours he covered 143 miles and hes steering 233 degrees true
5826918 if the second earner who in many cases is the woman is going to have to give 54 of what she earns to the government she might as well stay home with the children
5826919 there were twenty two women of whom three are working full time at this point
5826920 the idea that a return to the tax policies of the 1990s would harm the economy is supported by neither theory nor evidence nor the longer term history
5826921 the minister walked into a room full of medical professionals and accused them of being unethical and immoral for supporting harm reduction programs this is outrageous and irresponsible
5826922 the ones who are really unethical and immoral are those in this government who for ideological reasons ignore mounting evidence of the efficacy of harm reduction programs like insite
5826923 mr clement is neither a competent health minister nor a health care professional if he was he would know that supporting harm reduction programs is not a breach of ethics turning your back on people who run the risk of dying without your help is
5826924 his offensive performance was an attempt to justify a political decision to suppress harm reduction programs in canada
5826925 musharraf is a brave man and has his origins in india
5826926 all indians love him because of his straightforward foreign policy
5826927 this government has been caught cutting programs at the expense of food safety and it hasnt got the courage to admit what its doing
5826928 but we do know that cutting back on food inspection and handing it over to industry strikes at the heart of public concerns of truth in labelling public health and public safety and opens the door to dangers such as bse and avian influenza dangers we know are out there
5826929 leading food safety experts say the plan is a recipe for disaster this plan may lead to another walkerton and aylmer meat plant incident brought to us again by the mike harris gang in this conservative government
5826930 cutting this government service will mean the downloading of more costs onto farmers
5826931 this also jeopardizes markets for canadian food products with just one rogue incident our reputation will be tarnished costing farmers billions just like the bse crisis
5826932 it brings both of our companies a lot more strength and diversification
5826933 with this new venture we believe our firm is strongly positioned to offer added value in a variety of categories both to clients who worked with our previous two firms and new clients
5826934 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
5826935 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5826936 the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively

5826939 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship with russia but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual
5826940 we will reaffirm the commitment in bucharest and the meeting is also expected to approve a package of measures to support georgia
5826941 i think the allies are going to be firm that this was a violation of georgias territorial integrity
5826942 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
5826943 the french were ambushed in a village after they left the ozbin valley
5826944 they were ambushed from several directions the taleban and al qaeda forces used heavy machine guns and other weapons they fired from mountains and gardens
5826945 isaf forces on the base had before identified a group of insurgents posturing to attack the base and engaged them with small arms fire
5826946 helicopters arrived on station soon after and engaged these insurgents as they attempted to flee from the scene
5826947 three of the insurgents killed themselves by detonating their suicide vests isaf forces killed three other suicide bombers before they could detonate their vests there were no isaf casualties in the attack
5826948 it looks like this unit might have been daydreaming about some cool ones at the mess that night or something to walk into an ambush of this size and scope

5826986 incredibly irresponsible story from any reasonable perspective the fact is the rate was completely in line
5826987 the inclusion of information in the story about countrywide is irrelevant the obamas got their loan from northern trust the rhetorical purpose of the details about countrywide is to create an appearance that the obamas got a special deal because mr obama is a senator
5826988 frankly any reasonably savvy borrower should have been able to do better than average that context was missing
5826989 this was not a unique situation it is common and consistent business policy which shows no favoritism toward politicians celebrities or any public figures his rate was based on the fact this is a client who could potentially bring us more personal business
5826990 tilted over to any reader into a story of preferential treatment not justified by the facts the fact that obama is a u s senator is immaterial
5826991 there doesnt seem to be much of a story here

5826996 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5826997 the price must be maintained at a level close to us100 because the costs have increased
5826998 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5826999 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline

5827021 a persons sexual orientation should not be mentioned unless relevant to the story not everyone espousing gay rights causes is homosexual when identifying an individual as gay or homosexual be cautious about invading the privacy of someone who may not wish his or her sexual orientation known
5827022 the post did a wonderful job personally as far as the family is concerned we really didnt know about this until after his death it was in the back of our minds but we didnt discuss it
5827023 i really feel alan was a lot more than that
5827024 self serving whatever their cause is and that theyre trying to use alan to do that
5827025 he worked to change the system from within you dont out yourself to make a point just because hes gay should have no more relevance than im straight its not fair to make a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be
5827026 was very open about being gay it was a major part of his life it does a disservice to his memory
5827027 he was first and foremost a soldier and he loved serving his country
5827028 he was among the most open active duty military people ive ever met i cant imagine him not wanting people to know
5827029 being gay was a huge and very defining part of his life
5827030 that part of his story to be told to help move the issue of repeal forward
5827031 its a double standard to report basic facts about straight subjects like marital status while actively suppressing similar information about gay subjects it was clear that maj rogers led as openly gay a life as was possible given his military service he worked for a gay rights organization had gay friends and patronized d c area gay clubs its unfortunate the post chose not to present a full picture of this brave mans life
5827032 number one site on the web for those who read and love romance novels
5827033 it was just to get it out of the way and it felt good
5827034 it was good exciting especially getting back on the field in a brand new stadium
5827035 the first time stepping back out to me is great i feel great about it it was good to get back around my teammates and go through a practice and not be standing on the sidelines running and wishing i was out there
5827036 any time you get all the guys on the field at one time whether they are practicing or not when youre all together it feels good
5827037 once we get everybody back we feel like we have a great team here its always exciting when guys come back and are able to go back and be themselves and help this team try to continue to grow and win
5827038 so today was an exciting time to see everybody out there and enjoying the moment together
5827039 for me its been so long it felt good i was excited to be back with the guys
5827040 as long as i get the reps during these practice times six to eight reps during a preseason game is not really going to get me further along than practice
5827041 practice is where you get all your reps at and where you get right
5827042 im close im definitely good enough to go out and compete and play now what percentage is that who knows ninety five ninety seven i dont know but i think the more that im out there the next two weeks the closer ill get
5827043 i think im fine now but i should definitely be ready in three weeks when its time to line up on sunday
5827044 i couldnt believe not being out there not being with the team not going to practice the next day
5827045 it started getting better week by week by week to where im at where i can actually compete on it
5827046 it has been my goal all along well have to hope it continues to progress up until that point
5827047 all along that has been our goal to get back on the field to play that first game as to when im going to be back on the practice field that has kind of yet to be determined
5827048 ive told him hey its a long season so only hell know if hes ready i think theres a good chance he will be
5827049 he has about two weeks before practices start for preparation for the opening game
5827050 peytons on schedule we know theres more rehab ahead hes on schedule and the anticipation is hell be ready but it will be close everything has been pretty much as expected in terms of work on the range of motion and the rehab and theres no swelling or that sort of thing
5827051 i kind of take the approach when they doctors say they players are ready to go theyll be back i dont think we can guarantee that manning returning for the season opener thats what were trying to do is develop a 53 man roster and be ready for anything my sense is he will but well see what happens
5827052 i really havent had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
5827053 im doing ok ive had a tough month its definitely been a challenge for me its something totally different than anything ive ever had to experience
5827054 hes the guy whos really responsible for getting defensive end dwight freeney back and safety bob sanders back
5827055 it certainly has not been a pain free process id be lying if i said that its been a challenge but so far erin and i have faced up to it
5827056 i feel mentally ive been able to stay into it and coaches orders theyve allowed me to put my rehab first and foremost and try to do whatever i can to get healthy and get out there
5827057 its a totally new process for me i have learned to put my full trust in erin
5827058 he and i have had some pretty heated discussions and it has not been the most enjoyable process ive been through but he has been great he has challenged me and he has really kept me on an even keel as far as trying to make constant progress
5827059 you can expect an iconic photo of michael and the medals also no wheaties box this time around its going to be kelloggs
5827060 i expect that michael will be a global icon and hell have some interesting business opportunities along the way
5827061 were going to head out on a global media tour and then were going to go back to the states and try to make it around 10 or 15 different cities and try to promote the sport of swimming michael will see some of the fans that hes reached over the past week and have some fun
5827062 im carrying a weapon flying a multimillion dollar jet with passengers but im still screened as you know on the terrorist watch list
5827063 theres going to come a point in time where everybodys on the list
5827064 and all of a sudden he says how old is he
5827065 i want the burden of clearing this up to be on the agencies that are the holders of responsibilities the department of homeland security and the attorney general of the united states
5827066 we told the airlines we would allow them if someone gave a birth date to exclude that person from the list
5827067 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
5827068 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
5827069 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
5827070 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll

5827076 as we move forward our discussion remains focused on the economic realities facing all our campuses and institutes a new affiliation and a new business plan for the department of audiology and speech pathology will provide shared efficiencies and new opportunities for strategic partnerships
5827077 we are more than conquerors through the one who loved us for i am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor anything above nor anything below nor anything else in all creation can separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord
5827078 i expected that there would not be a positive reception on the nature and language of the blog
5827079 but i didnt expect the swiftness and severity of what happened
5827080 a supposed bastion of journalism should realize that readers in the internet age are fully capable of separating what a writer writes on his personal or commercial blog from what the same writer writes for a mainstream media source if you honestly believe that the integrity of your paper is or ever could be compromised by such then everyone in management at your paper is truly stuck in another dimension and will never fully understand this generations readership
5827081 firing michael tunison was a terrible terrible mistake mr tunison is a very unique and talented writer and you fire him for what drinking on the weekend having his own website if everybody was fired for that the unemployment rate would be nearly 100

5827090 one ounce of candor is worth a ton of baloney youre not going to fool people like carl levin henry waxman and john dingell
5827091 am i the only one annoyed by the posts constant glorification of illegal immigrants hardly a week goes by without either an uplifting or heart rending article
5827092 grass roots movement expands beyond montgomery in targeting the undocumented
5827093 your recent article on growing opposition to illegal aliens immigrants in maryland once again used the familiar ploy of labeling those citizens who oppose illegal aliens as being anti immigrant this is baloney there is a clear difference between the two classes and i certainly welcome those who are here legally
5827094 its impossible to cover this issue without the challenges faced by people who are here illegally we have tried not to be repetitive in those stories
5827095 very challenging to write effectively about people opposed to illegal immigration because they are very passionate and seem suspicious of our motives and are less welcoming to our attention when we try to talk to them about their motivations
5827096 foreign nationals who come across the border without papers or who overstay their visa are deemed illegal aliens those are the legally correct terms the correct terminology is not derogatory but carries precise meanings under law
5827097 the term alien means any person not a citizen or national of the united states
5827098 this small effective and agile team of professionals has played a key role in major international debates on intellectual property including helping to pave the way for making essential medicines more available and affordable in developing countries
5827099 were going to make a run in congress on this new idea
5827100 we wanted to have a bit more of our own culture
5827101 studies show that its done by a very small proportion of people and of the people who litter high proportions can be persuaded to change their ways and thats what gives me hope
5827102 this is such an awesome sponsor for our team at bristol
5827103 the television series knight rider is a show that everyone can get hooked on i think its really cool that nbc has chosen to reinvent the series for the fall line up the best part about the show was always the car kitt and this is amazing that i get to drive a version of kitt for the night race at bristol its every guys dream to feel like they are an action hero and i get to have that chance under the lights of bristol with our no 28 knight rider ford
5827104 the stealth look and feel of the car coupled with travis kvapil at the helm has us very excited about this race
5827105 this event exemplifies the adrenalin and action the knight rider series will deliver and illustrates the strength and compatibility of our sponsor partnership with ford

5827114 the need to collaborate with serbia to achieve lasting progress in this region
5827115 if the final status of kosovo is not reached soon the region risks a new eruption of violence that would also push back for many years serbias full reentry into europe and into the international community
5827116 we are pleased to be able to work for the government of serbia
5827117 on the results on nov 7 i think business is going to pick up

5827120 were committed to doing our part to work with all lawmakers to find real solutions for americas job creators nfib supported pro small business candidates in both parties and small business owners will now look to the congress to get the job done
5827121 i think our goal is to accumulate greater strength so we can be more effective we want to show policy leaders and lawmakers were a formidable entity
5827122 i dont think you can offer a real prospect of reform without that capability
5827123 logic and reason go only so far in this town you have to flex political muscle
5827124 were very concerned about the state of k through 12 because of its impact on u s competitiveness

5827129 its time for the country to address the problems of health care
5827130 affirms that we are one human family created by god into different nations and tribes so that we may come to know each other and not despise each other
5827131 a handful of extremists are distorting the image of islam
5827132 we needed to think of new ways of becoming more effective a much better way of communicating how we are part of the american mainstream
5827133 it is important that they other americans have a clear understanding of us
5827134 in the effort to win hearts and minds we have a unique card to play
5827135 that card is an invitation to visit america meet our people and experience our values
5827136 it makes good business sense it makes good policy sense theres no shame in it
5827137 as we look to the november elections shell be essential
5827138 this congress for us was a classic example of bipartisanship you simply cant pass a civil rights bill in this congress without democratic and republican votes
5827139 this gives us a huge marquee health care client and well pursue other health care clients
5827140 it opens up doors for us to a lot of other business

5827147 too many long anecdotal openings often reaching the point only after 15 plus paragraphs ive counted them send reporters to journalism refresher courses to learn the ws these can be skillfully woven into the lead by a careful writer
5827148 our problem is not with the length of the story but with the length of time it takes to find out what the story is about
5827149 the interesting thing is that papers are more than a dozen years behind the news trends feature style writing was a fine way to lure the non news reader into buying the paper in the pre internet days now people are on information overload and used to blackberry screen sized bits of meaning so you better write tight and get to the point fast if you dont grab the readers attention in the first one to three sentences most arent going to bother reading further
5827150 the focus of your paper should be on the time it takes for folks to read and understand the news you present make the reader the focus not the writer or the narrative strength of the piece
5827151 we wanted a leader who can help broaden the coalition of americans leading the fight to reduce gun violence and take action to get illegal guns out of our communities

5827158 we urge congress to complete its work on the pact and lay the groundwork for increased security and cooperation with india because it is in americas future security interests to do so
5827159 we felt it national security was the most important issue for the next 30 years our problem will be radical islam and non democratic china
5827160 we feel the public should get involved in appropriations when it matters before the legislation is passed
5827161 advancing crls issues in congress and nationwide is becoming increasingly important
5827162 increasingly industry is coming to capitol hill and the regulatory agencies and this requires more voice for consumers
5827163 theres no justification for having so many nuclear weapons that we could blow up the world several times over
5827164 this is definitely a case where the politicians are not listening to the people
5827165 memory will distort experience for its own doubtful purposes which makes me wonder if theres really any value to this experience thing at all why is having done something better than having imagined doing something i mean what if the so called value of experience is overin ated why do we expect to be changed by experience at all since traveling to rwanda i am more i have become increasingly plagued by thoughts of i am no longer i am more inclined to believe in but less inclined to believe about humanity how have your thoughts about the world in general changed since you left your hotel one morning and saw a woman missing her legs sitting in the grass on the shoulder of the road please explain
5827166 takes the warning letter very seriously and is actively working on providing the information requested by fda
5827167 im still a big tom delay fan and hes a friend of mine he had one of the amazing leadership operations on the hill
5827168 we have other people who can lobby the house leadership myself included
5827169 accepts no funding from business corporations labor unions political parties lobbying organizations or individuals it is funded primarily by the annenberg foundation

5827171 more of a conversation than just a lecture weve started to build a community to talk about the news and not just read it
5827172 every newspaper web site will have them before too long
5827173 i think we can all agree after reading howells lame comments week after week that the post should save money by eliminating her position entirely
5827174 the washington post is an excellent newspaper it has the most informative current up to the minute and objective news that is happening in our nations capital i think the comments section after all news stories should be eliminated they are like an open sewer
5827175 i find it unbelievable that a newspaper with the resources of the washington post cannot do a better job of monitoring the postings to articles you have a few posters who use racist and bigoted attacks on a regular basis requests to remove their postings take an inordinate amount of time to be acted upon if they are at all
5827176 the requests for removal a link accompanying every posted comment are the first line of defense and certain story topics such as the iraq war and local crime can be ugly and we keep an eye on those
5827177 we have to make judgment calls about whats an attack and what isnt its kind of like the old line about pornography you know it when you see it
5827178 insulting you would not publish such remarks in the paper why online
5827179 idiot isnt polite obviously but it doesnt rise to the level of removal not every comment will add to the debate in a meaningful way but that doesnt qualify them for removal
5827180 i beg you to do something for months there have been comments throughout the comments sections complaining about this and the problem has become much much worse
5827181 im a big fan of marc fisher but if the blog is simply going to provide a forum for anonymous venomous diatribes i hope this new feature comes to a quick end this mornings debut featured comments from someone who hates slow drivers truckers bicyclists a bicyclist who flaunts his disregard of traffic laws and someone who hopes to retaliate against that bicyclist by hitting him with a moving car
5827182 it would be wrong to filter out viewpoints that are antagonistic or aggressive simply because some readers might disagree with them the good news is that the comment boards are remarkably self correcting the ugliest comments get shouted down pretty fast

5827188 i realize the magazine was printed before her death but i received the magazine section on saturday and did not receive the front page of the sunday section with the explanation until this morning was any attempt made to include an explanation with the actual parade magazine itself in my opinion it was a horrible decision to distribute the parade magazine anyway
5827189 not exactly prominent it was a shame that the wp could not have drawn attention to this explanation in a more prominent manner than the sorry second item oh by the way buried at the bottom of page 1
5827190 prepared by an outside organization but she was assassinated a few weeks ago there is no excuse for that article being printed and having the caption on the front page of the parade cover as if she was still alive it could have been edited there was time to make that change
5827191 i am what terrorists most fear a female political leader fighting to bring modernity to pakistan now theyre trying to kill me
5827192 it was a difficult decision and we knew we would be criticized but the decision was a journalistic one not a financial one we knew all readers might not agree with it
5827193 it felt funny that she had just been assassinated and now the interview comes out
5827194 i want to go on record as saying that i found the publication of gail sheehys catty snarky article on benazir bhutto ten days after the poor womans violent murder to be in abominably bad taste sure the insert was already printed before bhuttos assassination and not distributing it would have led to a lot of lost ad revenue but someone should have shown a little common decency and made the decision to suck it up financially i recognize that parade is an independent entity from the post nonetheless this piece was distributed as part of your paper and your name was printed on the front cover of the magazine so i dont feel you can rightly deny all responsibility
5827195 we made a conscious decision to grow the practice because the clients demand it
5827196 we keep things out of the paper every day that we think are inappropriate
5827197 in one form or another with religion especially of the conservative flavor
5827198 opus poked fun at the strips characters not muslims or islam i see hundreds worse on the internet every day
5827199 i think there is a danger of us becoming so politically correct that we end up by blunting the critics bent and the satirists wit muslims need to be sensitive to the fact that in western culture there is a healthy tradition of not taking things too seriously
5827200 subtlety has never been my hallmark cartoons only work unparsed unexamined un deconstructed two weeks ago the today show spent 10 minutes doing exactly that with the opus muslim strips and it was like watching someone try to iron wet toilet paper
5827201 i was narrowly elected national superintendent at our 1977 national conference i was just 41 years old afterwards the deputy phil hills came up to me and said before we wind up the conference could you set some goals wed never set goals in 40 years of meetings
5827202 wed set goals for overseas missions and the remarkable thing is we always reached them
5827203 it seemed impossible so i got up and told the conference were going to suggest that we go for 50 increase and everyone put their hands up and voted and it happened
5827204 after the conference i began to think how are we going to achieve this i wrote to each of our churches and challenged them to trust god for a certain number of new decisions for christ two years later wed grown by 68
5827205 and whats really funny is they the news media never talk to real soldiers they pull these soldiers that come up out of the blue and spout to the media
5827206 if you talk to any real soldier and theyre proud to serve they want to be over in iraq they understand their sacrifice and theyre willing to sacrifice for the country
5827207 calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in iraq phony soldiers
5827208 reid initiated and other democratic senators signed a fiery letter to mark mays the chief executive of limbaughs radio network clear channel lambasting limbaugh and calling on him to apologize
5827209 to report it as a fact that limbaugh ridiculed soldiers who oppose the iraq war is beyond despicable what do you think were idiots out here
5827210 i think the story should have fairly explained the story rather than reporting one side as the truth
5827211 pbs is airing a series on the jewish americans we know what jewish identity has meant in the past what will it mean in the future how does a minority religion retain its roots and embrace change
5827212 jewish identity in the past has been locked into the holocaust experience it is a very good example of how a community can overplay a historic experience to the point that it begins to repulse friends the world did feel sorry for the episode but when an individual or a nation refuses to forgive and move on the regret turns into anger the jewish identity in the future appears bleak we have created a culture of violence israel and the jews are the biggest players and that culture of violence is eventually going to destroy humanity
5827213 controversial and inflammatory but a lot of what we publish is given the wide range of conversation on this site
5827214 it reminded me you have to be especially careful when editing religion
5827215 i read the piece as being a pacifists critique of israeli policy not an criticism of jews and as both a jew and an editor i take anti semitism seriously we should have asked gandhi to clarify
5827216 i was astounded that you chose to run the overtly racist rant by arun gandhi judaism and jewish identity are not based upon the holocaust jewish identity is based upon the torah a god given document to humanity his screed would have fit in well with nazi philosophy except for the inconvenience that gandhi would have not been awarded aryan status
5827217 i do not believe and should not have implied that the policies of the israeli government are reflective of the views of all jewish people
5827218 my intention was to generate a healthy discussion on the proliferation of violence instead unintentionally my words have resulted in pain anger confusion and embarrassment
5827219 ill conceived and sloppily written i regret the whole thing when i read it i flinched it should have come down
5827220 take it down always apologize when youre in the wrong and quickly
5827221 about what he has learned from this experience and we will have our panel discuss the issue we think this has been an instructive and enlightening experience we hope people will see it as such we made a mistake we went over the line and we are going to guard against that in the future but we dont want to muzzle people then there would be no point in having a pluralistic dialogue
5827222 i know well have a stronger voice in a year weve been building our membership for only five months
5827223 forgetting whether you get money out of it or not its a good thing to do
5827224 it was a great opportunity for us to continue doing what we had been doing in annapolis but with added resources
5827225 we wanted professionals who not only know maryland but who also understand what we do in washington and across the country

5827228 next year im coming back to the team and it should be good
5827229 having a year under our belts working together with the team should be a major plus thats one less thing we need to worry about were comfortable with each other and familiar in how we work together so it should be good
5827230 ive just been trying to put in decent results this year and with what weve learned running at the front of the pack i think we should be a real serious force next season
5827231 its the very reason we exist to provoke people to think of other possible ways to interpret facts and culture if journalists dont provoke people to be skeptical to ask questions then a truly informed democratic society wont happen
5827232 the new media are all much edgier and abrasive in language and tone to rise above the din newspapers have to be pungent to be noticed

5827240 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge
5827241 during these tough times some of our consumers dont want to be tempted as much as they have in the past
5827242 as we look forward into the second half of the year we see continued pressure on our markets
5827243 this is just to kind of stop some of the whining going on

5827248 the question is are you going to just be a niche player or will you be a national chain
5827249 they clearly are getting a nice buzz within the population but we often mistake our willingness to try new things as a trend
5827250 were not out there trying to get people to endorse pinkberry
5827251 it has been a natural phenomenon were focused on building the right infrastructure growing in other regions and building a fantastic company

5827278 the home town newspaper of the politics industry we wanted to focus on the people who are running national campaigns that was the origin of our gurus series to explain the art of politics and the strategic thinking behind each campaign
5827279 gurus is only important to maybe 20 people in the world but hes important to reporters
5827280 the best tactic is to orient around the voters not the candidates if reporters spend enough time with voters you find out what voters want to know

5827284 she will be a huge asset to google at a time when they need some help on the republican side
5827285 i have been incredibly honored to be able to serve the president in the white house but i am thrilled about this opportunity to join the excellent team at google this is an extraordinarily exciting and important time for the internet industry with many policy questions being debated and decided for the very first time

5827288 this is a time when more african americans will wield power in congress than ever before we want to be part of that mix
5827289 the prominent person in the church has no scripture for such an action her difficulty is already extremely hard on her and he would make it even worse this would be cruel treatment and something the lord would not do i recommend someone discipline the prominent member
5827290 i would allow the girl to teach as long as she only wore the pants required at school and dresses or skirts the rest of the time and i would discipline the pharisee that wants her disciplined for being a cruel callused graceless boor
5827291 the grace of god does not break fellowship and throw a teenage girl out of a church for wearing loose fitting pants to a school that she cant afford to go to but chose to because she got a scholarship i believe in standards and i believe in convictions but i dont believe in extremes that do this maybe this church member should go read 1 corinthians 13 and examine how much he cares for others where would any of us be if it werent for gods grace in our lives after we accept christ
5827292 i would say from what you told me that the girl wants to do right and the church wants to do right i would certainly not discipline her further it sounds like she has a heart to do right and needs to be encouraged not further discouraged
5827293 the standards for workers and decision to remove a person from a place of ministry sounds right and just but 1 corinthians 5 is dealing with fornication id have to educate that prominent person if that prominent person does not receive instruction but pushes the issue prov 30 33 then he would be sowing discord and find grounds to have himself separated
5827294 from what i understand from the information you listed i think church discipline is a bit extreme in this matter if the church standards are such that a teacher cannot wear pants at any time then that is their standard i have standards in our church for staff and workers also and i think it is prudent to do so if she violates that standard then i guess they can go ahead and not let her teach as far as not taking the lords table i think that is too far in this instance it doesnt sound as though this young lady is rebellious or stubborn the church contacted the school and they have their dress standards also i also assume this may be the only opportunity this young lady has at the present time to go to school because of her family and financial situation it seems clear that most if not all of this is not under her control the only choices she seems to have is to follow the schools standards of dress or not to attend the school is that the choice the young lady must face that seems to be the root of the matter to me a time in serious prayer by the pastor seeking the lords will is the best solution pastors have to make tough decisions but once bathed in prayer and led by the lord those decisions are better made it is easy to sit on the sideline and coach this one it isnt in my church but in summary i believe church discipline is not proper in this case
5827295 1 corinthians 11 24 34 teaches that a person is to examine themselves before partaking of the lords supper this is a self examination as a pastor of a church all we can do at this point is teach the proper way to observe the lords supper and that individual has to examine his her self to see if they are partaking of it worthily this has nothing to do with dress but our reflection and remembrance of the suffering of christ with the information provided below i see nothing that should keep this lady from teaching her sunday school class as long as she is modestly dressed spiritually minded faithful and prepared to teach neither do i see anything here that should warrant discipline from the church i would encourage the prominent individual to study the mentioned scriptures and pray for understanding
5827296 obviously the word of god is the final authority lets talk consistency and favoritism every person should then be held to the same form of discipline this is extremely hard to do since sin is sin and in gods eyes one sin is not greater than another this form of discipline could be administered evenly across the board what if the tithing records were made public failing to tithe is sin could it be reason to forbid participation in the lords supper
5827297 nowhere in scripture we will find that our lord will have us sin in order to conform to the worlds rules it is not our lords will for us to attend any school that demands of us to follow unscriptural beliefs almighty god has a perfect plan for this young lady and for each and every one of us
5827298 seems to me that standards for workers is a different thing than standards for attendees i would advise the girl to graciously submit to no longer being qualified to teach in the church and to go ahead and attend the school as she continues to grow in the lord she will develop her own convictions based upon her understanding of scripture concerning the prominent person in the church is his name diotrephes perhaps he should be disciplined because of his insensitivity to the growth rate of babes in the lord if the girl wants to be an attendee rather than a worker that is her business the prominent person in the church is the real problem not the spiritually growing girl who appears to be walking in the light if we offend or anger anyone lets offend and anger the prominent person not the babe in christ
5827299 i can see why the church would not allow her to teach in sunday school since not wearing pants at all is the churches policy or standard i do not however see the gross immorality as 1 corinthians deals with she should be disciplined no further by the church it seems to me that this prominent person in the church is taking it a bit too far especially for a young person who needs to be nurtured also i would consider her unsaved family great care should be observed to go to such an extreme as to turn her out of the church or withdraw fellowship could have a drastic effect on them though i agree with the standard of the church or its pastor wearing loose pants is not on the list of 1 corinthians 5 11 as to not allowing her to partake of the lords supper as i understand the bible the only way anyone can eat or drink worthily is to be saved by the grace of god washed in his precious blood who is worthy to partake of any of gods blessings outside of salvation none of us should be able to partake of the lords supper if sinless perfection is a prerequisite
5827300 this situation is unfortunate but there are a few scriptural considerations here first and i think the over riding concern for individual members is that whatever course of action is followed the members response must be based on love for this girl and a desire to see her become more like christ we know that christ said the mark of true disciples is their love for one another also christ give the 2 greatest commandments both of which center on love i believe it is important to maintain standards of righteousness but failure to do so in a spirit of love fails the test of scripture perhaps some pastoral instruction on the proper attitude towards restoring an errant brother might be in order for the influential member gal 6 1 second i agree with you on the issue of biblical modesty your description of the pants in question seems to indicate that they are relatively modest for pants though i will not dispute they are still pants and not the best choice unfortunately the school will not bend and the decision from this childs perspective is almost impossible our partners on the field have taken an instructive approach dealing with the subject of modesty regularly and allowing time for the holy spirit to convict on these issues they have seen a great deal of success but as new believers enter the fellowship they require the same instruction so he has a number of women in his church plants who wear pants at any given time each of whom require the same instruction as for this particular situation i agree that if she fails to follow the churchs standards for dress she may not hold a teaching position in the church but i find the idea of church discipline to be overkill it may be in time she will grow spiritually to the point that the decision becomes easier but until that time a bit of christian charity while not endorsing her decision will go a long way to helping her grow spiritually
5827301 as to the prominent person in the church who is calling for church discipline such an action could possibly destroy this girls faith not only in the church but in christians as a whole aside from that what kind of a testimony would it send to this girls family whom im sure the church is endeavoring to win to the lord i believe that a bit of grace might be extended here thank god for his amazing grace which he gives to us each and every day i corinthians 13
5827302 if the issue as you described it happened for us the person would be removed from leadership because of failing to meet the leadership standards however putting the person under church discipline seems to be harsh i would sit down with the person and explain that we cannot use them any more in a leadership capacity i would also make sure to explain scripturally why we are taking that position i would also seek to find out why she is choosing to attend a school that will take her out of a leadership position in the lords house at the moment i would think she has done nothing worthy of church discipline although there seems to be a desire to go in a wrong direction spiritually she needs to rethink the schooling situation and encouraged to do so what does god really want for your life to honor and glorify him 1 corinthians 6 19 20 sometimes schooling in a wrong place leads to many other problems i would probably discuss church discipline with the prominent member scripturally and seek to help him understand why this is not a church discipline issue i would let him know we will keep an eye on it and we will monitor the situation and take appropriate action as needed
5827303 if the young girl came home and immediately changed into the proper attire then her heart is right if the school has asked for this dress code for some form of moral issues and or it is freezing cold in the middle of winter and snow is 3 ft deep then the church and this particular member is unfair and unyielding to her plight and no christ like love understanding is being shown to her
5827304 i would not use church discipline we allow people of all kinds of backgrounds and levels of their christian growth to attend lost folks baby believers backslidden believers struggling believers if she insists on leadership then a line must be drawn but i would not discipline because she or her family have not grown enough spiritually to match others convictions while i do not know her or all details you must decide if it is real rebellion or a growth issue
5827305 said prominent person is not exhibiting anything remotely close to the love and wisdom of christ but rather has the spirit of a pharisee the term pharisee gets overused but it is applicable here i hate religious spirits i hate religion i e that of the prominent person when said religion is without the spirit
5827306 i do not agree with the wearing of pants by women unless they are loose enough to not emphasize the body parts that men are attracted to at the same time i have never found the issue of pants wearing to be an issue to which the scriptures speak in regard to her ability to teach sunday school it certainly does not fall into the category of a gross immorality such as 1 corinthians 5 requires to be disciplined churches can hold to convictions about women not wearing pants and i think they would be right but they must show mercy too
5827307 the real thing that matters on all sides is to have the right spiritual attitude and walk in true fellowship with god to put a godly girl out of fellowship because she has to wear s pants is absurd this is legalism to the max how can one equate the evil of 1 corinthians 5 with this girls situation
5827308 as to the matter of the prominent person in the church thinking that the girl should be banned from partaking of the lords supper that is not what the bible teaches the bible does not teach that the church is to police the lords supper the bible teaches that the preacher is to clearly preach the warnings about partaking of the lords supper unworthily and then let god will do the policing 1 corinthians 11 17 34 paul describes a very carnal scene in corinth in regard to partaking of the lords supper divisions heresies selfishness drunkenness etc but not once does he name a name in regard to the problem and tell them to be banned from the lords supper church leaders are never told to police the lords supper that is clearly left to the lord to do the preacher is to warn the whole congregation as to the seriousness of the matter and then it is to be left between the person and god this is where the fear of the lord must be preached and then leave the matter with god the church in question has a case in regard to removing the young lady from teaching a sunday school class but the church has no business saying that the girl cannot partake of the lords supper
5827309 as far as the individual that thinks she should be disciplined after the fashion of 1 corinthians 5 and she should not be allowed to take the lords supper i do not agree with that
5827310 my suggestion is that the man who wants to impose church discipline pay for her schooling at another institution which would not require the wearing of pants
5827311 my question is on what scripture is this prominent person basing that this fits the matter of church discipline as a matter of fact i am curious as to how other churches that practice discipline determine the criteria for such action beyond immorality doctrinal heresy or other blatant disobedience where does it get into secondary issues or preferences i do believe in discipline i am solidly fundamental and conservative kjb etc but this matter of this young lady concerns me that there is a violation of the spirit of gods word in this area we must remember the whole purpose of discipline is not what we do to get rid of those we do not like or who are trouble makers but the goal is reconciliation
5827312 first of all i corinthians 5 is talking about fornicators that were rampant in corinth and had gotten into the church i believe jesus condemned pharisaistic attitudes as im afraid this dear brother has jesus unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her it seems the dear brother has no compassion for her if i run everyone that does not do as i say out of the church i would have to quit preaching and close the doors oh how many souls would be lost because one of christs churches strained at a gnat and swallowed a camel leave her alone and pray for her and thank god for another witness at a college
5827313 this attitude is what has driven many good people away from the church and even from the lord may god help us to realize there are many other problems to face that a young lady being force to wear pants i dare say the man casting the stones at this young lady has issues in his life that someone could judge him for also
5827314 it sounds like someone is making things harder than it needs to be for this young lady unfortunately this type of behavior by mature christians is just what satan loves to instigate in trying to discourage young believers in being dedicated to their faith
5827315 we are faced with this more now than ever we have adopted the avenue of when an individual comes into our church not blasting them or being brutal i have known churches to be this way instead we have tried to get them close to another godly lady who builds a confidence in the persons heart and then we do three things first we instruct as to why ladies need to dress modestly at gods house and not just at gods house but everywhere second we purchase clothes for them if they have not the means to do so concerning the member who is influential and disagrees approach him about purchasing her clothes we have no right to condemn something we ourselves are not trying to correct third we exercise patience to allow god to change peoples hearts how many times i have witnessed this happening in our church and they have become great christians and great members of our congregation
5827316 she should attend the school suitably attired if they remove her from school that is their prerogative by bowing to school rules contrary to biblical rules she is making decisions on how she lives
5827317 can the church help this girl with money to attend a school that will not undermine the standards of the girl or the church sure it will be a sacrifice but this may be what the church ought to do we have tried helping people at times who even had some resources so that we could show in a positive way that we were for them and wanted to help them make the right decision it sounds like this is a good girl who wants to do right we ought to do all we can to help her i believe there are options available to help and church discipline which we practice and believe in is too stringent in this case from the details that i have been given
5827318 if the church has made a decision about the matter this other prominent person ought to submit to the leadership and leave it in gods hands this prominent person seems to be in the wrong hebrews 13 17 humbly submitted
5827319 i believe that church discipline in this situation is going a little too far i am a strong believer in church discipline but i also believe we had better be careful in our administration of it as for the lords supper that young lady needs to be made aware of the danger of partaking with known sin in her life but i dont believe that the church can stop her from partaking
5827320 i believe 1 corinthians 5 type of discipline is reserved for false doctrine immorality or disorderly behavior in my opinion although i do not believe a woman ought to wear pants the wearing of pants does not fit into either of those categories the dismissal from the ss teaching position a matter of christian service standards as set by the local church is sufficient discipline
5827321 church discipline in this matter is way out of bounds
5827322 i would have the following questions for the fellow causing the disturbance is he ready to declare the wearing of pants by a girl to be equivalent to any sin in the list of heinous crimes cataloged in 1 corinthians 5 11 i would ask the gentleman to provide a complete list of his convictions that would cause the censure of i corinthians 5 movie theater attendance card playing hair shorter than shoulder length on a lady or touching a mans ears or collar how about computer solitaire use of nyquil while we all hold our own convictions and standards and all draw the line somewhere on each of these with some room for disagreement on exactly where that line is the lines drawn in scripture are plain and clear and obvious to anyone who is honest with the text does the gentleman believe that if every member of his church were to make a list of their convictions that he would be squeaky clean with no violations which convictions would rise to the level of a shunning offense and which would be a matter of christian liberty and who gets to decide that we are wise to stick with what the scripture plainly says when it comes to a matter of church action
5827323 it seems to me that bringing this girl before the church for discipline is overkill at the highest level this young lady has been in christ for three years praise the lord for her growth but when churches start making issues like this akin with blasphemy heresy and immorality i think they have gone way overboard and btw neither my wife nor my daughters wear pants dont misunderstand me i believe the issue of modest apparel is an important one is this good church going to bring every lady in the church that wear pants before the congregation it just seems mighty extreme to me
5827324 i am only an old grandma but here is my reply this is unbelievable keeping her from taking the lords supper sends a terrible message to the rest of her family
5827325 if the church has standards then it is justified to not allow the young lady to teach but to bring her before the church in discipline is really ridiculous i would suspect with my thirty years as pastor of the church i founded that the man wanting to do so needs to look into his own self and allow the holy spirit to make the decision besides this is the pastors decision anyhow
5827326 i would tell the prominent member in the church to mind his own business
5827327 i would be in full agreement that if the church has modest clothing as a requirement for sunday school teachers the young lady has disqualified herself to remain as a teacher she of course should be told in the spirit of love complete with an explanation i would be in total disagreement with the man in the church who wants her disciplined for this issue as i understand the scriptures church discipline is reserved for certain types of issues which bring great reproach on the individual and the church if allowed to continue this is also spelled out in 1 corinthians 5 11 it is this type of attitude that gives our fundamental independent baptist churches a bad name a name for harshness while i strongly agree that church discipline is necessary within the parameters of the scripture the type of issue dealt with here would only create a witch hunt within the church of course i do not know the man in question i would dare say that he may also struggle in some areas of his life as well in the lesser issues not covered in 1 cor 5 11 mercy and prayer is often the answer i am so thankful for the mercy of god in my life as i often fail him and come short of his glory lu 6 36 be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful jas 2 13 for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment wisdom and discernment come from christian growth this young lady has not been saved very long and needs to be commended for the growth she has experienced and encouraged to continue to grow in the lord
5827328 since she does not meet the standard fine dont let her teach but church discipline over that i think is going a bit too far is she being immodest or seductive we do not have a practice of wearing pants in our home but does this mean she is living in sin i am all for separation and standards but this seems to be making mountain out of a mole hill sort of speaking does she need to be delivered unto satan for the destruction of the flesh or according to verse 13 is she really a wicked person because she is wearing trousers i think it is simply going beyond the bounds of scripture
5827329 i feel this teenager girl needs guidance love and understanding not persecution compassion for our brethren should be paramount
5827330 since when do the beliefs of a prominent person usurp the authority of the church i understand about prominent people and puffed up arrogance and their willingness to wield their influence over gods flock but a church is not governed by an oligarchy if she has agreed to standards for workers and now cannot fulfill those then she should not teach in a bible class sunday school but church discipline over pants
5827331 the verse about causing a little one to stumble comes to mind i spent seven years away from the lord because i was judged harshly by people like him when all i wanted was to serve and please the lord
5827332 it is the best example i have heard of transitioning from the ridiculous to the sublime it is the epitome of legalism
5827333 how many of us have sin in our lives let him who is without sin amongst us cast the first stone
5827334 the prominent member of the church should be shown the door not the girl
5827335 since when are a pants on women issue the criteria for partaking in the lords supper no im not in favor of mens clothing on christian women including pants my wife and two girls dont own any pants however all new believers must be taught from the word of god i e the lord that women should maintain themselves as women and not to wear that which pertaineth to a man the new believer must be dealt with in much patience to say the least the lord i believe has no problem molding a teachable christian who is going to lovingly obey the lord in all areas of life
5827336 i think the prominent person in the church should be disciplined and not allowed to take the lords supper for his harsh spirit until he repents and by the way i dont feel pants are modest
5827337 i would also suggest that the prominent person in the church that is seeking to have the young lady excluded from the lords supper restore her by paying her way to school or organizing a joint effort to pay her way through school so that she would not need the scholarship and therefore not be obligated to follow the rule that he finds so offensive
5827338 that she has been barred from teaching sunday school seems sufficient a measure in such a case as this the men need not think they would compromise their zeal by exercising sweet moderation let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand philippians 4 5 w e vines defines the word translated moderation thus equitable fair moderate forbearing not insisting on the letter of the law it expresses that considerateness that looks humanely and reasonably at the facts of a case may the lord give us wisdom james 3 17
5827339 it seems to me that if she is saved then she is saved and she is well and truly in the lords will
5827340 woe to the one who by bitter harshness destroys her faith
5827341 this teenager needs love to help her on her christ walk and to cement a brick into her calling
5827342 in all seriousness this member should be approached by the pastor to back off the pastor has an obligation to tend to the weak in his flock if she is even truly a weak christian she seems to be coming to church for all the right reasons this is not an issue to remove the girl over it doesnt sound like an obtuse girl or a girl in rebellion also it sounds like the prominent member could be a thorn in the pastors side i will be praying for the pastor i cannot believe that paul intended 1 cor 5 to be interpreted and used in the case as you described it she is a fornicator someone ought to follow the prominent man around like a hawk and scrutinize his every move scan his computer drive the man beating this drum as described is probably guilty of one of the sins listed in 1 cor 5 i would spend my time analyzing his life some people will never be happy unless they can execute judgment how about since it is a sensitive serious issue pray and allow the lord to work in the girls heart about the whole thing how about the prominent member exercise faith that god can fix whatever may ail the young girl i realize all cannot be fixed in this manner but i have pastored long enough to realize that some things the lord is better at handling without some folks personal involvement my final vote is to vote out the prominent member
5827343 im all for the girls and women not wearing pants my wife and our girls dont wear pants at all and our church knows our stand but on the other hand im not going to stop them from coming i will let god deal with them i just preach the word as far as the lords supper i think that is taking it too far this is a big delicate concern you dont want to lose her and at the same time we have to keep the standards high
5827344 in my opinion this is a difficult case because we do want to maintain biblical dress standards in a world that is always working against biblical values i think the church discipline already implemented in removing her from her s s class is as strong of an action as should be taken the opinion of the man who wants to keep her from the lords supper is i think unwise amp uncharitable i think this church should stand with the girl as she attends school by lovingly caring to see her grow in grace a spiritual lady in the church should become a very close friend to her that would be very important if there is no sign of rebellion in this girl i would stand with her as she goes through her education experience if there is a rebellious spirit present she may well be lost to the world and her new opportunities for an education obviously standards that are based on the word of god are very important but love grace and mercy are also important to be exercised by those in authority when there is a genuine desire in a young believer to walk pleasing to god may god help this church to be led by the spirit in all aspects of gods word
5827345 shes caught in a battle between standards those of the school and those of the church either way she decides to go it makes things difficult for her if they side with the prominent person simply because of his status theyve blown it because of their failure to heed james 2 1 4 brother cloud says that man is prominent but does not say he is spiritual even a marginal christian could try to force such an issue he does however say that the girls growing in the lord and faithful to the services including prayer meeting it seems theyre at risk of causing her to stagnate in her faith rather than continue growth and being they say that her wearing pants is a part of the school dress code and not her disregard of christian church standards it says nothing of her wearing pants to the services or while teaching sunday school i believe theyve caused more harm than good that prominent member used 1 corinthians 5 as his justification for seeing her disciplined yet in that chapter paul writes of sins of rebellion verse 13 tells us but them that are without god judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person i hardly see her as wicked when the writer notes the schools standards are loose pants its my belief hes noting pants that may be baggy not those that are form fitting taking away from her modesty nor am i led to believe that theyre low showing anything they should not surely we must be of good testimony among those that are unsaved to have them see christ in us likewise also show that same testimony among the saved lest we cause someone to stumble but to force her to wear something not beyond the pale of decent clothing while not in a church setting seems at best dictatorial not something that would be helpful to the young lady nor to the other members of the church
5827346 it is a classic example of straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel the prominent person sounds like diotrephes of iii john 9 amp 10
5827347 it seems to me that the brother who would enact further discipline is the kind who would bring the worlds accusatory of self righteous christian upon all our heads
5827348 there were prominent people in christs time called pharisees whom christ dealt harshly with because their heart was not right outwardly they looked the part but inwardly they were full of dead bones matt 23 discipline done right with a heart of love seeks to draw back a person not to destroy or run off from our membership or flock in dealing with this problem try to mimic christ and how he worked with patience john 8 3 11 not the attitude of pharisees
5827349 sounds like diothrepes to me church discipline is surely not for these infractions of dress what does the pharisees wife or daughters wear when not at church thanks for listening to my rant ive been preaching for almost 40 years and these things surely gripe me
5827350 i would almost say that the prominent person if not careful could be brought up for church discipline for causing discord among the brethren
5827351 if the man is the only dissenting voice in the assembly this needs to be pointed out to him as well along with scripture that speaks of the danger of schismatic and divisive persons within the body maybe he is the one that needs to be disciplined finally maybe someone can suggest that this prominent man undertake to finance the destitute young ladys secondary education in its entirety at another institution more to his preference

5827407 meeting with julia goldsworthy mp on 10 july christine michael boon and janet kelly travelled to westminster to meet with julia goldsworthy mp the liberal democrat shadow secretary of state for communities and local government our prime purpose was to try to clarify the lib dems current position on local taxation julia explained that lib dem policy would first and foremost be to get rid of council tax and replace it with a local income tax however once that had settled it is likely that they would in order to balance the tax system introduce a land value tax which would apply to domestic properties and run alongside local income tax it is plain that the lib dems are still working on the detail of their lit proposal but julia did state that it was proposed that local councils would set the lit rates and that initially lit would be geared to raise the same amount of money as ct with the level of support from central government remaining the same she estimated that the lit would be about 3 but with leeway either side of that figure michael warned that firstly in his opinion payrolls would not cope well with a system based on a large number of rates they could maybe cope with one based on allowances and secondly that this version of lit could well turn out to be a national tax disguised as a local one we left julia with some reading matter and a selection of michaels tables illustrating how the current system appears to be failing how the situation can be improved and how local authority spending is almost entirely determined by central government afternote since our meeting it has been reported that the liberal democrats are planning to soften their support for a local income tax to replace the council tax a key policy for at least three elections instead they are expected to propose reforms to adapt the council tax vince cable the liberal democrat treasury spokesman is backing the shift in stance he believes the party should not look to introduce or press any coalition partners to introduce a local income tax for at least one parliament

5827464 if soft or non economic compensatory damages were allowed costs of vets would zoom and many animals would not get the care they need or would be put to sleep when not absolutely necessary
5827465 our laws ought to honor the bonds that human caregivers have
5827466 theres a real difference between property and the animals we share our homes and hearts with people who grieve for their animals shouldnt have to accept market value as a measure of damages

5827479 secretly commissioned a thriller novel whose aim was to scare the living daylights out of folks who might want to buy cheap drugs from canada
5827480 they had no meaningful way to participate and no evidence was presented against them
5827481 i think it is an incredible and astounding exercise of police power
5827482 you cant take away a kid from their parents by saying hey maybe later on there might be some abuse its a way of flipping the constitution around so that they now have to prove theyre innocent instead of the state having to prove theyre guilty
5827483 you dont have to prove abuse at that first stage

5827485 i can finally say i will be able to marry john the man that i love

5827487 our state now recognizes that an individuals capacity to establish a loving and long term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individuals sexual orientation
5827488 an individuals sexual orientation like a persons race or gender does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights
5827489 doubt on whether the official family relationship of same sex couples enjoys dignity equal to that of opposite sex couples
5827490 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid and recognized in
5827491 but i and this court must acknowledge that a majority of californians hold a different view and have explicitly said so by their vote this court can overrule a vote of the people only if the constitution compels us to do so here the constitution does not
5827492 creates the opportunity for further judicial extension of this perceived constitutional right into dangerous territory
5827493 who can say that in 10 15 or 20 years an activist court might not rely on the majoritys analysis to conclude on the basis of a perceived evolution in community values that the laws prohibiting polygamous and incestuous marriages were no longer constitutionally justified
5827494 the court is exerting some leadership here and i think it needs to be said that it is a new role for the court
5827495 this has not been a court that has been willing to stick its neck out and lead the way on cutting edge issues like this that involve such strong political feelings
5827496 the majority is not always supposed to have its way
5827497 that decision will come at the end of a process that is now just beginning
5827498 taking those issues off the table which the domestic partners act did might have made this an easier case for everyone

5827518 fifa today decided that the 2010 fifa world cup preliminary competition match between georgia and the republic of ireland scheduled for 6 september 2008 will take place at a neutral venue due to recent events in georgia which have affected security in the entire country
5827519 fifa reached this decision after closely monitoring the situation in georgia and taking note that uefa also decided to ask georgian clubs involved in uefa competitions to play their matches in neutral countries
5827520 the georgian football federation has until 26 august 2008 to nominate a neutral venue to host the qualifying match against the republic of ireland which will take place on the scheduled date of 6 september 2008
5827521 it would have been very difficult for us to play in georgia for both teams not only for us the first game is very very important
5827522 i am sad about the situation but we cannot do anything about that it is important the teams play on september 6 it is important to continue the calendar
5827523 it was important that we did play the game no matter where it was we have everything set out and the players were looking forward to the two games

5827528 we cant walk up to wal mart and get the technology off the shelf and put it into use
5827529 instead of running from the problem theyre running toward it in hopes of finding a legislative solution that actually leads to safer mines
5827530 a great opportunity to help promote progressive policies and ideas
5827531 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
5827532 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
5827533 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
5827534 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
5827535 we saw with the estrada nomination how important the voice of the congressional hispanic caucus was
5827536 we cant have a million caretaker walk in washington we have to be home when were not working
5827537 we are excited and we are trying to get kicked off with a bang
5827538 we have been in a retreat this morning to get an action plan together
5827539 its just a wide open potential a jewel looking to put the chamber back on the mark
5827540 youd have to be dumber than a post to buy a ticket given the fact that they were giving em out like candy
5827541 if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5827542 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5827543 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
5827544 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
5827545 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
5827546 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be
5827547 i told her what happened she said ill call you back
5827548 a lot of people are shocked to find out we have agriculture here we do believe it or not although were about 75 years behind the rest of the country
5827549 its interesting being a farmer here because the research that you all are used to benefiting from is really just now taking place for example we have been experimenting with no till agriculture in alaska and have discovered it doesnt work here
5827550 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5827551 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5827552 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5827553 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5827554 nothing surprises me in this game so when they called on last friday to tell me i was prepared
5827555 i cant say i expected it but i was ready for whatever they were going to tell me ive seen crazier things than this since ive been here its an opportunity for me to get on the field so im excited
5827556 our fullback has to be able to block or at least sustain a block where hes not getting pushed back
5827557 he has to be effective in the pass game and be able to catch the football and the handful of times that we give him the ball during the season he has to be productive with those
5827558 we also ask our fullback to be a good special teams player or at least a contributor so that ends up being the main part
5827559 ive realized that special teams is more important and part of my responsibilities as a football player
5827560 i noticed some guys were playing ahead of him last season just because they play special teams i saw that its a way to get on the field
5827561 i think this is something tony is going to have to work hard to be able to do in such a quick time
5827562 to do it in a week and be really good at it its probably going to be tough
5827563 im slow and im short but you give me the ball to gain a yard and that shouldnt be that tough for me i also love to play special teams
5827564 im a football player you put me on a football field and i know what im doing
5827565 were just going to take each day as it comes and ill keep communicating with shawn to see how hes doing
5827566 we want to see where hes at later in the week and the only way to do that is to communicate
5827567 the defendant has been observed walking up and down the parking lot of the park del mar apartments complex in tampa wearing his uniform and carrying a ceremonial sword apparently practicing parade drills
5827568 he does receive a lot of items in the name of other people but cannot explain why
5827569 its my business to stay here and sing about it

5827573 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
5827574 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
5827575 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5827576 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use

5827581 ive probably got henry by 50 60 pounds to be kind to myself

5827584 they used to freakin pull out chains and knives and s
5827585 obviously a player of mats sundins stature hes been a tremendous player for a long time
5827586 hes a free agent and weve made inquiries as to his status we dont know whether hes going to play or not i think mats is still trying to decide that in his own timeframe but if he wants to play wed certainly have an interest in seeing if we could fit him in

5827591 la selecci n brasile a dio adi s al sue o ol mpico pero en esta oportunidad la eliminaci n fue m s dolorosa la derrota fue ante argentina que gole por 3 0 y se clasific para la final
5827592 nico t tulo que le falta la medalla de oro ol mpica parece no combinar con los cinco veces campeones mundiales el resultado adem s pone fin a un ciclo de 15 a os sin perder ante los hermanos en juegos decisivos la ltima vez hab a sido en cuartos de final de la copa am rica de 1993 decidida en los penaltis
5827593 el sue o de conquistar la in dita medalla de oro en los juegos ol mpicos acab para la selecci n brasile a en toda la historia ol mpica brasil jam s consigui subir al lugar m s alto del podio con su equipo de f tbol
5827594 el sue o de oro ol mpico acab por lo menos otros cuatro a os jugando defensivamente y sin opciones de ataque brasil perdi frente a su rival argentina y qued por fuera de la final ol mpica
5827595 adem s de no conquistar el oro la selecci n vuelve a ser el centro de cr ticas por parte de la prensa brasile a principalmente el t cnico dunga que tendr dificultades para mantenerse en el cargo en caso de que fracase en los pr ximos partidos por las eliminatorias mundialistas

5827598 dimos muy poco respecto a lo que puede dar este equipo
5827599 hay que respetarlo pese a los resultados de sus ltimos partidos
5827600 tenemos algunos lesionados pero llegamos bien a este partido que es distinto a los de la liga vamos con una peque a gran ventaja que ser especular si ellos no marcan goles debemos tratar de que se desesperen y para eso hay que salir a atacar

5827607 the central issue in this case is the restriction of ballot access for third parties which has been and continues to be a problem in massachusetts
5827608 requiring smaller political parties to re gather signatures for their final nominees is a significant and burdensome expense and thus serves as a barrier to their full participation in the electoral process
5827609 we urge the massachusetts elections division to ensure the right to vote by returning to its prior stance of allowing substitution of the final nominees on the ballot
5827610 the right of political parties or candidates to a place on the ballot bears directly on the right of citizens to vote if parties or candidates are kept off the ballot their adherents are compelled to vote for representatives other than those of their choice
5827611 the denial of a place on the ballot thus constitutes a deprivation of the franchise
5827612 but how did you have a bad dream if you werent even sleeping henry
5827613 i dont know that either i just had one and it was bad
5827614 there is no direct evidence that momin khawaja had any knowledge of the london fertilizer bomb plot
5827615 we shouldnt be focusing every four years on whether we want to get on the platform
5827616 to be honest i think its a good point that people are making
5827617 if you take olympic size swimming pools in canada you have about 20 40

5827621 each year the u s treasury departments office of foreign assets control collects millions of dollars in penalties from american corporations who have violated these sanctions from oil companies banks food and beverage companies and entertainment companies
5827622 no executive of any such corporation has faced criminal charges individuals businesses and organizations that have openly defied the sanctions have faced only fines criminal prosecutions have only been made against muslims and people of middle eastern origin accused of violating these economic sanctions and unlike those corporations there was no profit motive in dr dhafirs case
5827623 every person charged with a crime in the us deserves and is entitled to fair and equal treatment under the law
5827624 no es normal que un equipo que quiere ser protagonista tenga suspendidos hemos hablado con los jugadores para decirles que si queremos lograr algo no podemos tener m s errores ya que lo que viene se nos puede hacer cuesta arriba
5827625 sabemos que los jugadores pueden disputar un gran partido o crear situaciones con 11 en un partido pero te digo que a pesar de las expulsiones el equipo siempre trat de reaccionar ante las dificultades esperamos no tener m s expulsiones ya que este equipo intentar jugar y no golpear esas cosas las debemos de corregir
5827626 es una ventaja que estamos dando debido a todas estas dificultades ya que todav a no podemos definir el cuadro base ojal que de aqu en adelante podamos recuperar a todos y no sufrir de bajas que me toque elegir a los mejores para jugar que pueda tener el grupo completo para que sea competitivo y as pelear hasta el final

5827633 to think back and i made up a character you know and just made it up but suddenly a man came named henry winkler and he made this character real
5827634 i dont think you should see anything over 50 mph and thats gusts
5827635 they called for assistance were sending four people and an inspector another utilities crew is also going to give out water
5827636 you are on the gustier side of fay right now
5827637 theres also a report of a power line on fire along richardson street
5827638 i dont think there is much left of the shoe to send back
5827639 they do have the bloody lynyrd skynyrd t shirt that evan had on and plan to send that back
5827640 evan of course will take a longer bit but has only stitches to overcome fortunately none on his beautiful face the attention the media has provided him has been very therapeutic for him mentally not to mention making him quite a little star with his friends
5827641 if it wasnt profitable i wouldnt be able to stand here
5827642 in zero gravity the player is set free to play in new ways
5827643 complete freedom of movement and unique level design create an experience that is at once familiar to anyone who loves the fps style and yet strikingly different to any game theyve played before
5827644 with a lack of style games begin looking too similar

5827646 our analysis clearly shows incredible growth in online pc gaming proof that this industry is far stronger than anyone has reported
5827647 i have nowhere to hide if a tornado hits that said i want to be out of here sooner than later
5827648 we were here during the last hurricanes and the parking lot was full of water
5827649 we had beach sand right up to our door i dont think theres a need to board up
5827650 a good blow like this they could break free and crash into the marina
5827651 im not really worried we dont think its going to be much of a storm its much worse up north
5827652 as you can see we dont have a big crowd
5827653 but well be having meals along with plenty of coffee and cookies
5827654 ive done more business in the hour and a half since i opened than i do on a normal tuesday

5827662 but after several incidents like these it would be appropriate for apple to take some measures to raise the publics awareness
5827663 en nuestro estadio ellos van a estar un poquito m s atr s y esperando
5827664 en nuestro estadio ellos van a estar un poquito m s atr s y esperando esa contra que a ellos les gusta pero esperamos que en el bernab u y con nuestra gente nos metamos en plena temporada
5827665 estamos en pretemporada y faltan muchas cosas pero en el partido de ida le hemos dado al equipo contrario lo que ellos quer an porque sus principales virtudes son el robo del bal n y la contra y nosotros hemos perdido muchas pelotas en zona peligrosa y ellos tienen gente de calidad
5827666 las cosas hay que valorarlas fr amente y no valorarlo s lo por un partido porque el madrid siempre que pierde un partido se dicen muchas cosas pero hay que tomarse estas situaciones con tranquilidad porque si ganamos la supercopa en casa van a decir que no necesitamos fichajes
5827667 supongo que el entrenador y el apartado t cnico del club han analizado esta situaci n hace mucho tiempo por lo que va a ser la temporada y lo que nos va a exigir
5827668 son diez a os aqu pero lo que tengo claro es que esta temporada quiero que sea diferente a la anterior no por minutos jugados sino por mis sensaciones no estuve contento con mi a o pasado no me qued bien despu s de la lesi n y no estuve a la altura de lo que he dado siempre
5827669 este a o he afrontado de otra manera esta pretemporada y lo nico que quiero es que el mister sepa que me tiene de verdad para afronta una temporada dura y que estoy al cien por cien por y para el equipo
5827670 seguir jugando mientras siga disfrutando del futbol y cuando vea que soy prescindible en ese momento igual har otra cosa el real madrid te exige mucho
5827671 seria un error centrarnos s lo en la d cima al final lo que te juegas cada domingo es la liga la champions es muy bonita pero la puedes ganar o no y es muy complicado y depende m s de c mo est s en marzo sin embargo la liga es al d a y si te centras en europa puede ser que te quedes sin nada
5827672 no lo veo tan mal y creo que se va a quedar con nosotros ya hab a dicho que tiene mucho m s para darle al madrid y es uno de los jugadores que marca la diferencia
5827673 yo lo he vivido y siempre es mucho m s exigente tener que estar al m ximo nivel y al cien por cien en tu equipo y tu selecci n y m s cuando se trata de espa a u holanda
5827674 si no vas convocado sabes que cada mes tienes una semana m s tranquila como esta y un par de d as de descanso con una edad como la de ruud y con todo lo que ha jugado creo que es un alivio y a nivel de equipo nos vendr muy bien
5827675 lo veo muy bien aqu tiene muchos holandeses y eso facilita su adaptaci n todo son gente muy buena y fiable para un vestuario rafael se ha adaptado r pido y estamos muy contentos con l
5827676 estoy contento por l porque yo he tenido la suerte de estar con pep en la selecci n fue un pedazo de jugador de los que m s clase han tenido en la selecci n y por c mo ve el futbol creo que es el entrenador perfecto para el barcelona
5827677 tambi n es importante rese ar todo lo que l ha significado para el barcelonismo hacerte una idea de un equipo por la pretemporada no es una visi n real para ejemplo nosotros que el a o pasado hicimos una mala pretemporada y despu s estuvimos muy bien en la liga
5827678 vicente es un hombre al que tenemos mucho cari o le deseo todo lo mejor no creo que cambie mucho porque lo que se ha hecho est muy bien y aunque cada entrenador tiene sus gustos l ha dicho que cuando uno gana no puede cambiar s lo continuar

5827683 take a look at these notes and tell me what you think
5827684 ok so lets implement it and get this game going
5827685 nope that was s concept they would have been in charge of the team on that one cant you just work with the idea

5827693 for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all so we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal

5827703 if your application is data starved and you need more performance panasas should be considered

5827710 even with only three or four virtual servers on physical machines the i o requirement really gets driven up
5827711 although blade switches generate less money compared to directors or standalone switches for brocade the growth rate of blade switches is probably highest
5827712 and hp is no 1 in blades so this is important for brocade

5827720 i asked them why they are taking him they said they are preparing charges of terrorism sectarian killings and displacing people
5827721 my son is a humble man he does not deal with political things he only owns a shop of spare car parts
5827722 i wish american forces had captured him rather than the iraqi army once the iraqi army has him he will not be released
5827723 when we returned to the government we expected our guards would be released
5827724 were creating an ambiance a point of relaxation a meeting place
5827725 they started in los angeles and flourished there for a reason
5827726 because l a is all about image and hype and being seen being seen doing things that are cool people see a photo of paris eating pinkberry and they want it
5827727 the question is are you going to just be a niche player or will you be a national chain
5827728 they clearly are getting a nice buzz within the population but we often mistake our willingness to try new things as a trend
5827729 were not out there trying to get people to endorse pinkberry
5827730 it has been a natural phenomenon were focused on building the right infrastructure growing in other regions and building a fantastic company
5827731 theres always a window of opportunity they are hot for a couple years and die down everything is cyclical
5827732 nato is not a washing powder and it doesnt need rebranding
5827733 but we can always do better in communicating what we do
5827734 with clear responsibilities in essence for upgrading the tools that nato has for communicating
5827735 perhaps you could say that you are concerned for her and that you dont want to see her end up with fines etc
5827736 they ask the questions the moviegoer wants to know about they get the information the moviegoer wants to find out they give you great narrative they give you great exposition theyre the perfect movie hero and thats why i think weve had so many films featuring investigative reporters

5827741 when i hear women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and theres not the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad i get frustrated
5827742 my daughters i dont want them to ever confront a situation where they are disadvantaged because of their gender the thought of it makes my blood boil thats what were fighting for
5827743 lilly ledbetters case before the supreme court has once again awakened the nation to this discrimination and its time we join together to right this wrong and pay women equal pay for equal work
5827744 we all respect john mccain for his incredible courage in vietnam but this election is about who will be the best president to lead our country in the 21st century that person is clearly barack obama
5827745 this election is one of the most important elections in a generation and veterans and their families have a lot at stake we want to make sure that the next president understands the threats facing this country and will make the right decisions about war and peace
5827746 hot inflation and cool housing leaves the f o m c stuck in neutral for now
5827747 given the weak nature of domestic demand now and going forward it is likely that businesses will have increasing difficulty raising prices to consumers
5827748 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american
5827749 they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
5827750 at about 12 30 an iraqi force entered the building they were in seven humvees and two black gmcs they took all the weapons from the guards when the secretary abbas al timimi tried to go to the operational command building he was shot dead without a word he is a civilian he wasnt carrying any weapons
5827751 security forces put him down he said im the president of diyala university and ive done nothing wrong they told him to shut up and started shooting down the doors upstairs they broke into closets and took things from our room and others about 10 million iraqi dinars equivalent to 8 000 two mobile phones a laptop computer
5827752 we pretty much have the same solutions that weve always had
5827753 theyll give you a meter to test your blood but not the strips
5827754 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5827755 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level
5827756 but i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia
5827757 certainly there will be a lot of changes in our cooperation with nato and we will have changes in the volume the quality and the timeframe in our consultations and meetings
5827758 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia
5827759 the united states got precisely what we sought in this statement
5827760 its not every day that a sovereign country is invaded and wrecked the events of the last few weeks should make us all realize that russia means business
5827761 i think the next step after the withdrawal of the russian forces is effective international engagement which completely substitutes any russian presence on the soil of georgia
5827762 to move from the courtroom to the classroom and the union hall
5827763 the whole child what we should be doing to improve not just math and reading proficiency but to help improve a whole child
5827764 we need bottom up real solutions so kids in st louis and kansas city have a level playing field
5827765 her agenda is really where we need to be focusing
5827766 this is my fifth year as president in st louis and were getting ready to have our seventh superintendent
5827767 if nothing else we need some stability in the district at the top
5827768 it was so revealing in how far weve come that she could stand on equal footing with any of them
5827769 you spoke so beautifully you have to make this a reality otherwise it will remain a speech
5827770 i get to shift economies its extremely liberating i breathe differently
5827771 its never a full implementation it is easier to dream than to do
5827772 in america and australia it has to be outside the car
5827773 she pulls in then shes squeezing between two cars to drag out this big cable and walk it back to her car shell be wearing her nice work clothes and getting them dirty
5827774 weve just lost half the market you need to make life simple for people
5827775 but at the end what you want is a snowflake
5827776 what do we need to make this happen two servos two degrees of movement for the arm
5827777 this is the driver experience he goes into a spot and the spot connects itself in 2008 we put the cable in the unit in 2010 we use an arm in 2012 theres a smart arm that connects automatically for the home unit the users get a pull cable for free or they pay 500 and they get autoconnect itll cost 250 to build and well sell it for 500
5827778 by the time hes thought of something to him its been completed its been achieved
5827779 the other trait is that by the time youve understood what hes thinking hes already somewhere else youre in catch up mode 24 7
5827780 in order to bring about this dramatic change sometimes we need a boy like in the fairy tales to say look the emperor has no clothes we can all see that for ourselves so how come we havent said so and this boy comes along and puts things in motion to bring about change and the boy in this story and he really is a boy practically but he has achieved more than many adults have is of course shai agassi
5827781 when you want a fish you get a woman and when you want a woman you get a fish
5827782 he had the self image of being an equal to steve jobs or michael dell or bill gates
5827783 even if this ends up destroying for lack of a better word my refinery business that will be small money compared to what this will be when you play chess you give up something to get something else
5827784 we wouldnt have invested if we thought this was a onetime one place story
5827785 you dont have the normal car problem where you need first gear to get off the line we just took the original transmission and stuck it permanently in second
5827786 when you take your foot off the pedal the car has kinetic energy
5827787 the motor starts charging the battery turning the kinetic energy back to electric energy
5827788 if youre regening it means you used too much energy in the first place
5827789 ah you are not a computer its not like you can calculate how much energy you need to get to that red light
5827790 every time you do regen theres a loss its not like you get it all back
5827791 the perfect driver would cruise around without ever using regen or the brakes when they came to their destination they would coast to a stop
5827792 zero percent tax on our cars dong as a partner
5827793 but there was already 0 percent tax on alternative energy cars in denmark
5827794 ill be offering 20 000 cars in a market where youre selling 60 000 cars how many have you planned to sell in 2011 in denmark because i recommend you take them off your plan
5827795 i have a strong feeling this is where the industry is going to go
5827796 we are not aware of any reason why automakers would not sign up for this
5827797 i have so many sins to pay on my climate bill right now that we hope this works really fast
5827798 we separated the ownership of the car and the ownership of the battery see car companies dont know how to assess the life of the battery so they go through these complicated programs of testing them for a long period of time and we told the car company you know what just like you dont sell a car with a card that says here is oil for the life of the car you dont sell cars with the batteries for the life of the car because the battery is crude oil
5827799 if we also buy clean generation we reduce the price of clean electrons so that at the end of 10 years clean electrons are cheaper than coal based electrons and nobody builds another coal plant at that point thats another 40 percent of co2 emissions thats the treaty tony blair is now working to get for the world by 2050 im telling you we can get there a decade after we finish the car side we can get there in 2030 60 percent reduction in our co2 emissions
5827800 i joke that 29 days a month shais my boss and one day a month
5827801 will transfer 2 trillion to 3 trillion out of the economy
5827802 we dont make batteries so arent we going to swap out foreign oil dependence for foreign battery reliance
5827803 all you need is a plug right why would you need an infrastructure
5827804 my proposal was about health care or something in san francisco
5827805 this is the irony the city is working harder to get their business than the business itself shouldnt he be sucking up to san francisco
5827806 our mission is to break the worlds oil addiction before it breaks us
5827807 were not its not us to them its them to us you see people want this to happen we just happen to be in the way of their getting what they want we cant give them the car fast enough thats something we need to capture were here to serve you not were here to sell to you were a facilitator not the creator this is going to be a community we just need to get out of their way theyre going to push for policy theyre going to sell the cars theyre going to be zealots
5827808 he tells you the story and it sounds so simple why dont we have it today why isnt it here already
5827809 if virginia was the same state as it was four years ago or eight years ago there wouldnt be much discussion about virginia being a swing state
5827810 from our perspective the places we need to do well and frankly where we have the greatest support are the places that are growing the fastest
5827811 the obama campaign is changing the map they are not accepting the rules of the game
5827812 they are putting more voters in play obama has decided to put more cards in the deck and they are dealing themselves more kings and queens
5827813 registering voters is incredibly important but it is also about turning them out and that is something i think we do a very good job at
5827814 not medically actionable even though if i did i would think seriously about talking to my physician about aricept and other regimens
5827815 a critical appraisal of the scientific basis of commercial genomic profiles used to assess health risks and personalize health interventions
5827816 which analyzes conclusions drawn from snps panels used by seven nutrigenomic companies including the report draws the following conclusion insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that genomic profiles are useful in measuring genetic risk for common diseases or in developing personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations for disease prevention
5827817 die testergebnisse zeigen dass die dopaminwerte bei schlafmangel steigen k nnen sozusagen als ausgleichende antwort des gehirns auf das steigende schlafbed rfnis
5827818 das ist das erste mal dass eine studie anhaltspunkte liefert wie sich dopamin daran beteiligt das menschliche gehirn auf den schlafmangel einzustellen
5827819 we didnt see much of a change from q2 to q3
5827820 its allowed to outsource this task to china after all bullets will only benefit from the highest of lead content so even a minor wound will result in success just something to consider
5827821 im pretty unorthodox i can find the leg from anywhere thats just what happened i didnt even see the leg but i ended up grabbing it and i just popped my hips took him to his back and kept driving i knew if i kept driving he would end up on his back which he did
5827822 ive probably got henry by 50 60 pounds to be kind to myself
5827823 if i cant sleep ill drink a whole gallon of water
5827824 in our house if you cried about something youd get laughed at
5827825 they used to freakin pull out chains and knives and s
5827826 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
5827827 the caves havent been disturbed by anything we can see what happened on the scale of a few decades in lakes of the appalachian region youre looking more at the scale of a millennium
5827828 breathe less changing the mix of light and heavy carbon atoms in it
5827829 global warming will leave things like this in the dust the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
5827830 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
5827831 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5827832 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
5827833 this work represents a radical improvement over prior work presented by this firm in incorporating a protective layer that drastically lowers the solar absorptance to an acceptable value
5827834 the variable emittance electrochromic technology is an entirely new technology pioneered by this firm to the best of our knowledge no other group has done any work in this area
5827835 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft
5827836 when i got on i was only ordered to pay 114 a month because the courts couldnt determine how much money i was gonna make
5827837 i was like what the hell is that who can survive on that as far as it looked to them i didnt have a job but i was paying more than what was ordered and something came up one day and she came to me and said i think we need to sit down and talk because i need more money my attorney got with her attorney i think we did it in a cool fashion
5827838 we came up with an agreement i was paying 2000 a month i would take care of all his medical issues expenses extracurricular activities anything to do with my son and that was the agreement and i never missed a payment
5827839 i dont pay it directly to her i pay it through the georgia department of resources office of child support services
5827840 my banker wires the funds to dhr they wire the funds right to her account however long that takes she needs to discuss that with them and not put me out there bad like that
5827841 but they never brought up the fact that since i been on ive contributed over half a million to charities and i do charitable work every week you got cats out here who dont even be with their kids and it hurts even more because i am a black man you born into this world as a black man your backs against the wall so im trying to do everything i can to go against the odds that was against me when im born and when you look up in the media at stuff like this depicting your character to be just what they stereotype you as it hurts
5827842 paying 2000 a month i would take care of all his medical issues expenses extracurricular activities anything
5827843 when i got on i was only ordered to pay 114 a month because the courts couldnt determine how much money i was gonna make

5827846 the nationals are natty the braves are brave be there when adjectives collide
5827847 the reds are coming to colorado just like barack obama whose hope will be more audacious
5827848 were some of the best pass blockers in the nation

5827857 it doesnt matter if shes black or white it doesnt matter yay yay yay uh huh he he
5827858 why black athletes appear to favor white women versus sistas
5827859 i really felt for this guy who gets a chance to grow up gets a second chance at fame and gets to finally live his dream
5827860 i was an actor for a long long time before i had any real success but i was always working so i can really relate to someone late in life getting a shot at celebrity
5827861 this is a new method of getting meeting content out to the world and letting more people have access to some great products and presentations not only can you watch these meetings but you can also interact with the presenter this presentation will not have the local live audience that the first live broadcast of the orlando meeting had but we also hope it will not have the internet hiccups we are working hard on broadcast quality and hope you can join us
5827862 im under a crunch to prove that any ordinary person can learn and profit from my money making strategies
5827863 well die we fight and we die thats how it goes
5827864 why do you think so many people even fellow democrat strategists are saying this was incredibly insulting and elitist
5827865 abba rocks anyone who says otherwise is probably mourning too deeply over the loss of george carlin and needs to be kicked while theyre down
5827866 alan moore you wrote my favorite issues of radioactive man
5827867 oh really so you liked that i made your favorite superhero a heroin addicted jazz critic whos not radioactive
5827868 i dont read the words i just like when he punches people
5827869 i heard you get on it married and when you get off it youre single
5827870 i told you that id know nothing and that is the truth

5827873 we are supposed to be in the off season for track but the phones have been going crazy
5827874 the school holiday sessions are fully booked up and we are trying to introduce more sessions
5827875 everyone wants to get on a bike in the velodrome where the olympics stars trained
5827876 we even took a call from someone in saudi arabia who wanted a track session here while he was over on business
5827877 the olympic triumphs have added impetus to what was already a success story here
5827878 jason kenny team sprint gold medallist started as a youngster at the velodrome
5827879 people of all ages get to sit in the same area that the elite athletes use and they get to go on the same track which has to raise aspirations
5827880 manchesters velodrome is the centre of excellence for our home grown cycling talent and the home of british cycling
5827881 along with the other world class facilities at sportcity it makes manchester stand out on the world sporting map
5827882 i agree that marijuana should be legalized its really less harmful than many legal substances but im convinced that harder drugs like cocaine are really dangerous and harmful to people so they should remain illegal
5827883 yes thats true and its no reason to make marijuana illegal and have to deal with all the other problems of prohibition
5827884 no marijuana doesnt cause lung cancer and heres the proof but even if it did cause lung cancer it still wouldnt be a reason to make marijuana illegal and deal with all the other problems of prohibition
5827885 that was the law before the initiative and its nothing new i dont know why wed relax any law
5827886 were concerned during the democratic national convention that they are going to use the law to cite people or detain them
5827887 the ordinance says lowest priority it doesnt say stop prosecuting im not concerned police will get carried away i want police to focus on whats important and i expect they will
5827888 marijuana was the drug of choice for mexicans hippies and black people
5827889 this guy is really scattered he cant remain on topic for more than a couple of paragraphs
5827890 say dont you remember they called me al it was al all the time
5827891 there is so much gray in there and police officers we dont do well in gray we need to have a lot of black and white
5827892 the cultivation possession and use for adult personal use of cannabis shall be the lowest law enforcement priority for law enforcement agencies in the county of hawaii
5827893 there are better higher priorities for police than running around trying to find a few casual marijuana users
5827894 people are really tired of seeing money misappropriated away from education and healthcare to fund a military style war on a plant
5827895 its clearly going to give law enforcement more time and resources to focus on serious crimes its going to provide lots of space in our prisons its going to help courts run smoother and its going to essentially save this countys taxpayers millions of dollars every year
5827896 it pretty much tells us we have to ignore it
5827897 in this case if i wanted to use the marijuana as the basis for a search warrant no i wont be allowed to do that
5827898 one would have to question why they couldnt even get 4 000 qualified people to sign the petition
5827899 if people work really hard and get the message out it has some chance of passage
5827900 the real work really begins now to try to educate the voters and get them out to the polls in november

5827902 its not so much an apology im making more an explanation to you for the anger

5828145 although turmoil in global markets affected share prices it also presented attractive buying opportunities for our manager
5828146 this was the 10th place shed seen but this really was it and we got the terrific neighborhood too
5828147 its cozy and yet were close to everything we just dont have to see it were tucked away from the hustle and bustle but can get to leesburg in 10 minutes
5828148 for a small community like this the participation level is incredible the lake trails and woods attracted us but the neighbors kept us here

5828151 if i had a crystal ball id pick a lottery number and run
5828152 i hope it changes and changes quickly but i dont see that happening however for at least a year
5828153 it was kind of uncomfortable what you do where you went to school if you want to live there you kind of have to sell yourself
5828154 and often there are lots of people there its a very bizarre arrangement
5828155 you can go to 10 of those without being accepted to live at one
5828156 the first year out of college its a big shock to my system anyway studios can be isolating
5828157 the house had wall to wall carpeting heavy draperies on the front south facing windows and a wall at the top of the staircase that eliminated all the light from the northern windows
5828158 whats happening in columbia heights in terms of sheer magnitude of investment is nothing like anything weve seen in our neighborhoods
5828159 nearly all our blockbuster projects are on large tracts of vacant land in parts of the city where few people currently live in columbia heights were seeing literally a billion dollars worth of development woven into a large dense urban neighborhood
5828160 it will take somebody thats really into history and likes old houses
5828161 certainly we would try and work with the potential new owners to identify those elements that needed to be preserved and the strategies to accomplish that
5828162 if hes not the best pitcher in the league hes in the top three or four
5828163 hes unbelievably consistent when hes in the game the fielders know theyre going to get some action
5828164 weve been working with him to concentrate more on hitting to the middle of the field and to hit better pitches be more selective
5828165 when you get down like that its hard to keep coming back we still had 8 5 innings to get back in it but we just didnt get much done
5828166 you cant short circuit the process of holding folk accountable just because you fall in love
5828167 was disgusted by the idea that the senator transcends race nobody asks white candidates to transcend their race he said
5828168 voting for the guy who happens to be black might be the easy way out
5828169 im gonna have to call tavis up and straighten him out on this
5828170 there is no issue that hes discussed whether its health care discrepancies for minorities or what have you that isnt central to my campaign
5828171 it was a bad decision for him not to show up
5828172 the convention will offer a series of contrasts and comparisions of the mccain record so voters can see how clearly the choice will be in november
5828173 the convention will also introduce senator obama to the country but it will make sure to convey strongly the differences and choices obamas campaign presents over mccains
5828174 for three decades as our energy crisis grew decision making in washington has been rigged against our national interests and the interests of american consumers
5828175 and for almost that long senator mccain has been part of the problem for decades he has stood with the big oil companies and voted against the development of the alternative energy we need
5828176 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5828177 he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that
5828178 they do not feel like theyre slipping in the polls but they just think they need a clear definition of mccain supporting bush economic policies as well as being totally a d c figure
5828179 he needs to do it because if you dont fight back voters think you wont fight for them
5828180 therefore you have to do it to win their support the benefit outweighs the cost
5828181 typically you would want the status quo of this campaign to continue in a pro democrat year in the polls its risky they must have polled this and focus grouped it
5828182 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5828183 the remaining contingent that was used to reinforce the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the territory of south ossetia and to russia
5828184 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honour the words of president medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment which is not happening as we speak he signed together with the president of georgia
5828185 this is one of the first units to be pulled out
5828186 the russians time and again move their tanks to tskhinvali the south ossetian capital from gori and then back again i categorically deny this amounts to a withdrawal
5828187 the final phase in radio 2s transformation is a monumental achievement and were excited to offer vibrant stimulating and diverse music to canadians
5828188 the new programs will showcase the best of this countrys songbook and provide national exposure for canadian artists
5828189 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5828190 would have primary responsibility for overseeing and monitoring implementation of long range planning including the comprehensive plan
5828191 measurably reduce the workload on council members and staff as well as office of planning personnel
5828192 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5828193 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5828194 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5828195 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5828196 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5828197 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5828198 so i have a job to do a job to complete in that sense yes i would like to run
5828199 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing on its own and living off its own means
5828200 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5828201 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country
5828202 does not have a properly functional government yet it must get that
5828203 the reason we are still around is because of the immense resilience of the afghan people and their goodheartedness toward the presence of the international community
5828204 other than that activities like breaking into homes would have gotten us into serious trouble a long time back
5828205 we also want the weaponry in this war to be targeted at the terrorists properly to be aimed at the right place
5828206 i dont want afghan casualties the war on terrorism is not in afghan villages period it is in the sanctuaries of terrorists at the training ground of terrorists at the financial resources of terrorists
5828207 it is virtually impossible to mitigate against loss of civilian lives when insurgents mix in with the local population
5828208 i dont for a second believe that afghanistan has a problem of terrorism
5828209 afghanistan has only suffered at the hands of terrorism or the consequences of it
5828210 what is troubling is the deteriorating set of conditions across the border in pakistan military sanctuaries expanding in areas in the tribal area and the freedom of movement across the border to afghanistan
5828211 with regard to corruption its a deeper problem its an afghan problem
5828212 its the problem of an inefficient government machinery its a problem of economy procedures its a problem of so much money coming into afghanistan its a problem of the international presence
5828213 in 2007 israeli experts trained georgian commandos in georgia and planned to supply tbilisi heavy weaponry electronic weapons tanks and other arms at a later date but the deal didnt work out
5828214 noyes has threatened to kill me and my family and will not rest until we are dead all the evidence you need is in his computer and that little girls mind please save her
5828215 extreme punishments such as locking her in a closet with no food for three days
5828216 weve seen refineries pull back because refining hasnt been profitable
5828217 the economic news that continues to come in is all pretty gloomy out there
5828218 if this conflict continues to widen i dont think the market is going to be able to ignore it anymore
5828219 i dont think weve seen the last of iran and israel
5828220 you shudnt b here man pissed of old army commander dude is gonna b mad at chu
5828221 nah mah its k i talked to him we need all the chefs we can get
5828222 okay marcette we can go out the cafeteria way it takes time but its pretty densely guarded or we can go into mah helicopter which is waiting behind that door
5828223 its okay man theres a mcdonalds down the street lets keep moving
5828224 locust chefs take cover theyre probably gonna challenge us to a cook off
5828225 im all out of propane and i dont have my barby with me
5828226 alright guys i want a nice clean cookoff tasting no bits and pieces of chunky crap and its okay i brought the bbq sauce
5828227 well we bettered get going they said well see you later as they headed towards the king eagle see you guys later
5828228 you need to have enough eggs to make this thing work and when you have enough eggs it does work
5828229 we are pleased to have two of the industrys best talents to lead our award winning global national team into the next era of electronic journalism
5828230 more canadians than ever have come to realize that global national stands for reliable reporting and provocative storytelling along with our award winning anchor kevin newman kenton and neill are the perfect team to take the global national brand to new heights especially with the launch of four new foreign bureaus
5828231 you spoke and we listened our channels put the listener in the drivers seat allowing them to choose the kind of music and docs they want to hear when they want to hear it
5828232 whoever goes to eastern market is the eastern market neighborhood all of
5828233 we wanted to make people know nationally that eastern market is a treasure
5828234 eastern market and capitol hill were chosen because of all this personal investment and the effort put into preserving and restoring
5828235 its absolutely gorgeous i told him but in this location id die in a month
5828236 for people who work from home i dont think there could be a better place going to the market is like going to the water cooler
5828237 oh let me tell you what were doing this year
5828238 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5828239 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5828240 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5828241 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5828242 sal we gotta go and never stop going till we get there
5828243 there are so many of those have they havent they dreaming posts online we really cannot respond to every one of them

5828262 our proposals will be designed to ensure the smooth functioning of markets and to support equally the important role of bets on the upside and the downside
5828263 its almost like i dont know i dont want to say its just really hard
5828264 at the 320 mark my right hamstring grabbed me and i just couldnt move it anymore
5828265 ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control on the straightaway i was all over the lane and christine ohuruogu was just really strong coming home
5828266 i dont want to tell you what im thinking right now because its not positive
5828267 i feel so betrayed by my body once again and its such a tough break for me
5828268 i crossed the line and it was very hard for me to pick myself back up
5828269 it took about 30 seconds todays hard tomorrows going to be harder but what can you do but try again
5828270 if i ran 9 6 shutting it down i wouldnt be nervous at all either
5828271 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
5828272 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
5828273 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5828274 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5828275 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5828276 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
5828277 i want to say there is no truth to the claim
5828278 if it is true do not just toss numbers but reveal their names
5828279 time and time again customers have expressed to us their frustration with obtaining the right personnel and performance for their technology rollout project requirements
5828280 it is a frustration that grows exponentially as the number of site installations increases
5828281 our customers count on us to be quick but at the same time provide a high standard of service quality and customer care
5828282 at concert technologies we pride ourselves on our unique ability to integrate technology equipment and technicians to work together in a harmonious fashion at multiple sites nationwide or globally

5828285 read my lips there is no shortage of landfill sites there is a shortage of landfill capacity which is a wholly different thing and that is entirely because of the eus landfill directive which imposes severe constraints on the use of landfill as a waste disposal option
5828286 so confident that anaerobic digesters offer a realistic means of dealing with food waste that earlier this year it offered 10 million in grants to encourage the construction of further demonstrator plants plans for at least 60 are under way in britain
5828287 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5828288 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5828289 we believe that congress saw that antitrust violations would not be a significant concern with this deal
5828290 weve been opposed to this from day one and our opposition will continue
5828291 we will continue meeting with members of congress and take all steps possible to protect workers because delta and northwest management clearly are not
5828292 they are hustling to get this done before the bush administration leaves
5828293 chose to announce this merger in 2008 in part because of their belief that the bush administration has been very pro management
5828294 im a little bit surprised there hasnt been more outcry from the public
5828295 na dire o e no roteiro da pel cula enquanto tony todd
5828296 on the other hand it may be due tofell over from heart failure
5828297 in addition to helping build the line to dulles perhaps we can help metro financially
5828298 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed
5828299 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for
5828300 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5828301 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5828302 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5828303 they need it today it would be wonderful today if they had it and got the kids off the street and into a camp like that work hard and earn money and learn what life is all about
5828304 it just takes some time a little bit of time its gunna be alright alright
5828305 are really sick people and a 1 000 or 2 000 deduction is not going to change their behavior very much
5828306 subtracting the amount on line 32 from the amount on line 24
5828307 if there is more than one accident view the risk more favorably if the accidents are spread among the drivers rather than one driver having multiple accidents
5828308 multiple not at fault accidents are considered an unfavorable factor
5828309 accidents caused by defective bridgestone firestone tires that were involved in product recalls are not to be considered for underwriting or rating purposes
5828310 the architecture might be looking like the local american style of architecture but the ambiance and friendliness that is pretty much the way it is back home its what keeps us going
5828311 its becoming more diverse so there are a lot of options were putting in homes we never had to think of before
5828312 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5828313 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5828314 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5828315 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5828316 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5828317 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5828318 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5828319 homeowners are looking for neighborhoods and communities designed to include greater access to public transportation recreation commercial and entertainment options
5828320 where smaller land parcels closer to urban centers are targeted for development
5828321 those bad loans were just a response to our real problem
5828322 whats happening in the market today is not the bursting of a five year bubble
5828323 try to find a single family home in the d c area for the national median of 221 900
5828324 the american judicature society has a long and honored tradition approaching 100 years of bringing citizens judges lawyers and academics together to work for the improvement of our system of justice i look forward to working with our dedicated hard working board and national advisory council and highly professional staff to advance the mission of ajs
5828325 im still doing what ive been doing all my life working composing practicing and taking care of business
5828326 there seems to be an insatiable appetite for this kind of imagery
5828327 in the near term calendar year earnings will continue to benefit from favourable reserve development from prior underwriting periods but accident year loss ratios are likely to increase materially from prior years as market conditions erode further
5828328 this cushion then diminishes as the hard market accident years mature
5828329 people shouldnt be afraid of their governments governments should fear their people
5828330 for attractive lips speak words of kindness for lovely eyes seek out the good in people for a slim figure share your food with the hungry for poise walk with the knowledge that you will never walk alone

5828333 es complicado estar en una situaci n as y tener la motivaci n latente porque pr cticamente es un milagro que nos podamos salvar del descenso
5828334 en realidad todo lo vemos de la misma manera demasiado complicado debido a los malos resultados ya que est a la vista los n meros despu s de la ltima jornada
5828335 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5828336 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5828337 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5828338 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5828339 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5828340 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5828341 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5828342 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5828343 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5828344 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5828345 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5828346 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5828347 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5828348 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5828349 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5828350 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5828351 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5828352 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5828353 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5828354 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5828355 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5828356 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5828357 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5828358 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5828359 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5828360 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5828361 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

5828404 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5828405 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens

5828423 you have my authority to negotiate a settlement on whatever terms you deem to be in my best interest including the possibility of a settlement with no monetary payment to me but which would shield me from any claim for costs from defendants by my filing a voluntary dismissal in exchange for a waiver of costs
5828424 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5828425 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5828426 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5828427 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5828428 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5828429 the department supports the ordinance that the city passed but it is clear that it amounts to an unfunded mandate so the department as we are one to do in many situations well do the best that we can
5828430 the department was provided no funding to enforce this ordinance or to advise the community about this ordinance so everything is being provided pro bono
5828431 if you dont put something behind the ordinance then its a feel good gesture and we dont want to be a city that does empty feel good gestures
5828432 i always think that legislators should research not only the outcomes and impacts but should always research and ask questions about enforcement
5828433 otherwise we government run the danger of enacting legislation that is not going to be enforced which to me is the clearest of messages to our citizenry and our public go ahead and be a scofflaw nothings going to happen
5828434 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
5828435 if you have a green party i want to join
5828436 i want the client not to have to navigate citigroup i want us to navigate citigroup and bring it together at the front end for them and thats why you need to bring all the organizations and geographies together under one cluster head
5828437 if youve got the business run through products its very difficult to make everything come together across product lines for a client
5828438 if you look at the structure what ive basically done is taken some of our top talent in asia and given them bigger jobs and given them jobs that cut across multiple business lines
5828439 for what we were spending on the credit card i thought i might as well get something out of it
5828440 its a cloudy picture right now for reward redemption everything has been gone for some time
5828441 do some celebs name their children unusual and just plain freaky names because they think their spawn is too special for an ordinary name i think that might be it either that or they want to add difficulty to what would otherwise be a charmed and easy life
5828442 we tried to make the record different from the live experience
5828443 i think one thing that we all appreciate in records is variety
5828444 we struggle trying to get the energy right in the studio its really hard to try to find if youre not performing with anyone or for anyone its really hard at least for me to get the feelings that i need to get going but a lot of the songs always start off more how they are on the record than how they are live but a lot of times they have to change from record to live
5828445 we were both himself and brian just studying down there living with families studying anthropology we only had classes a few days a week so we had a lot of off time so half the time was spent travelling and and a lot of it was spent learning to play andean instruments which was the sampone sp which was those pan pipes and the charango sp which is a ten string instrument similar to the mandolin and we decided that one of our goals was to record an album while we were down there to bring back to the states so we recorded it in a childrens music school in bolivia and they had all the equipment there and we recorded it just on a computer
5828446 i was a religion major stu was economics brian was public policy and james was history
5828447 that song is the result of us spending way too much time in a van and finding ways to amuse ourselves and it eventually turned into a song it initially started with us making up jingles for different things we made up jingles for mustard stuarts got a great mustard jingle theres a mayonnaise jingle soy sauce its the only sauce you can soy my parents gave me a world atlas that we put in the car for christmas and we were flipping through it and kuala lumpur was a nice word
5828448 i really like the way it sounds its fun to add extra ls when youre saying it it kinda helps a long van ride go by
5828449 i think it was a marching band outfit or something from a local high school
5828450 were trying to hone in and match the outfits somehow with the music i guess and channel the sounds that were trying to make into some sort of visual representation
5828451 i find it really helps me cut loose too that we go before the show and we change into wacky clothes that represent our band that gets me like time to go time to get fired up and time to bring it
5828452 we play in some rooms in different towns called listening rooms where everyones seated and staring at you and thats like whoah whats going on here whereas a loud bar while it can be frustrating sometimes it can also be extremely rewarding because if you can get a group together and get them really fired up and moving together and having a really good time theres no better feeling than that
5828453 my first show with the band actually we were playing rosetta stone i think for the first time and daniel came rocking back at me to count in an intro or something and tripped on a cord and took out half my drum set we finished the song though but with a new drum part
5828454 stuart managed to knock my snare drum over mid song and had to hold it for me it worked out though weve had several people tell us that thats the favourite moment of any of our sets you know us breaking stuff
5828455 thats actually my favourite moment in live shows these days is like when some sort of sound shortage happens and people are looking at each other or some microphone falls down

5828462 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5828463 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5828464 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5828465 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5828466 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5828467 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5828468 who are open to doing something on the production side
5828469 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5828470 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5828471 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5828472 we cannot assume that social security is going to provide any more benefits in the future than it does now

5828476 the playstation 4 and xbox 720 will arrive in 2011 or 2012 we think
5828477 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5828478 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5828479 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5828480 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5828481 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5828485 we have a long way to go and well get there we have to establish ourselves as a customer relations center that not only apologizes when things go wrong but also works hard to convince customers to give us another try
5828486 people who have been in the business longer have more understanding and can better respond to customer concerns
5828487 i wonder how an 18 year old who was just hired by the airline can actually respond to my issues
5828488 my experience with airlines is that customer service is generally useless theyre generally not much empowered to make much of a difference
5828489 im proud that we are putting a program like this together and that we are not going to try to spin our way out of a time when we can use the additional help
5828490 were not saying we will be the lowest fare every time 100 percent guarantee
5828491 but we will say that southwest has the lowest fares in the industry and the highest amount of seats at those fares
5828492 theyre not always the lowest if youre able to purchase well in advance thats when you have the opportunity to get the less expensive flight
5828493 that gap that existed between southwest and the other airlines has narrowed substantially

5828508 i want the burden of clearing this up to be on the agencies that are the holders of responsibilities the department of homeland security and the attorney general of the united states
5828509 we told the airlines we would allow them if someone gave a birth date to exclude that person from the list
5828510 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
5828511 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
5828512 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
5828513 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll
5828514 we wanted to know why isnt barack obama closing the deal among racists
5828515 if you think that continental flight was full before theyre going to be putting folding chairs in the aisles
5828516 if any airline goes on strike it is going to impact you no matter what part of the country youre in or what airline you fly
5828517 flights that were canceled in the past wont be canceled they will be delayed instead for however long it takes to fix the plane
5828518 youre going to see more flights operating at 2 a m than ever before they have to get those planes out
5828519 when you have fuller planes and when you do have a cancellation there is no place to put these people you have to get these flights out
5828520 some folks want to get that eye contact its like when you go into a store and the clerk doesnt make eye contact with you you may not feel like you want to be there
5828521 the majority of people really dont want to fly they should have a good travel experience when theyre on the airplane so we try to treat each customer as if it was the first time theyve ever flown

5828560 we cant raise our prices to cover our travel costs we have to be creative where we can
5828561 there are more people who want to get on the airplane than we have seats
5828562 i dont know that the company is doing the right things to keep people loyal in the times they really need customers
5828563 when load factors are 82 percent you dont have to offer a lot of incentives but when business slows down thats a time you really rely on your most loyal customers and this could cost them
5828564 if i cant get an upgrade i have little incentive to fly them ill fly united instead at least i get can extra legroom in their economy plus
5828565 we plan to make sure the ability to get upgrades remains consistent
5828566 im thinking uh oh i might not be going anywhere
5828567 we call them comment cards on steroids with the added bonus of being statistically relevant
5828568 we were at the mercy of whoever is collecting the comment cards if someone handed susie a comment card that said susie was rude do you think susie is going to hand that card in
5828569 we can very quickly identify if we have a hotel that is delighting guests or hotels that arent meeting guests expectations and help fix the situation
5828570 we have repaired the fill in the blank in your room if you need further assistance please call the hotel operator
5828571 were able to find out what our guests think quicker and respond
5828572 have presented the most challenging operations that we have had since 2004
5828573 i realize there was little the airlines could do but they should at least understand that people like to be kept in the loop on matters that pertain so critically to their plans
5828574 ive already started hearing complaints from frequent fliers who say that theyve been trying to redeem their miles for summer travel and havent been able to do so
5828575 my recommendation is to book now there are going to be certain flights that at peak travel times are going to have a limited number of frequent flier seats available
5828576 its thanks to mattia he doesnt smoke or drink that ive changed my life and become a sane serene person
5828577 id cleaned up the inside and wanted to freshen up i had it done in germany because they try to stick to your natural look in america no disrespect to the plastic surgeons everyone comes out looking the same

5828593 president medvedev announced to sarkozy that the withdrawal of russian troops will be concluded august 21 22 with the exception of a team of 500 personnel charged with implementing additional security measures under article five of the august 12 agreement
5828594 invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of georgias infrastructure
5828595 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5828596 we cannot cooperate any more with an organisation which works with criminals
5828597 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5828598 we are unable to approve the policy because of potential travel to israel
5828599 we will be able to reconsider this decision once you have returned from israel and there are no future plans to travel to countries of concern
5828600 now that means we just need to figure out a way to get them there
5828601 ive also asked for some additional forces on top of that for the current fight
5828602 but i would not use the term surge because i think we need a sustained presence
5828603 but its going to be much much harder to turn things around at this point
5828604 the nursing staff had evaluated the patients nutrition the review revealed no nutritional consult was requested and revealed no evidence the physician was notified about the inadequate nutritional intake
5828605 they said he was lying down and didnt feel like talking
5828606 they wouldnt let me see him i think he died that day
5828607 theyre desperately trying to find ways to reduce their exposure while still keeping their customers happy
5828608 this whole miles for merchandise mini movement is being forced onto the airlines by their own inability to make good on the promise of free award seats
5828609 at the end of the day people participate in these programs for free travel that is and will always be the principal motivation for people to participate in these programs
5828610 if i wanted a new tv i would go out and buy one
5828611 the transmission of diseases during air travel is something we dont have a complete understanding of
5828612 one or two coughs dont bother me but if they are coughing uncontrollably for a while you better believe i have grabbed my stuff and moved
5828613 it may seem rude but my health is worth more than a few hard feelings
5828614 of course any time you are in contact with other people there is a possibility of transmission of communicable disease from a common cold to something more rare and potentially more serious
5828615 its also important that people monitor their own health and defer travel if they are ill just as you wouldnt want your co worker to come into the office if he or she is sick you dont want to sit next to someone on a bus at the airport or on an airplane who may be contagious
5828616 weve always known that the air quality on board flights wasnt the best but there isnt much a passenger can do
5828617 encourage further scientific research that will allow these risk factors to be better identified and understood
5828618 were looking at their work ethic their ability to interact with and advocate for customers those that are highly skilled at resolving problems and those that own problems as their own and look for solutions
5828619 do you believe that bending a company rule is ever ok
5828620 is it always necessary to be as candid as possible when explaining a situation to a customer
5828621 how an individual will respond for you on behalf of the customers
5828622 i am totally for raising fares a few bucks per passenger instead were getting feed to death
5828623 at a time when the planes are full and frequent fliers are already feeling a little abused this is not the time to introduce something stupid like this
5828624 this is one of the few things that would make me instantly drop northwest as a carrier of choice
5828625 watching it very closely to see how successful it is
5828626 consumers are looking for as much choice as possible its not about the lowest price anymore
5828627 the airlines have stripped all comfort accommodations to a point that it is a bus with wings an old bus at that
5828628 hes in the preliminary stages of looking at the issue
5828629 id be happier if you permitted passengers to only take one thing on
5828630 some of those bags are occupying more space in a plane than i do
5828631 weve always urged them to limit the amount of carry ons
5828632 in our opinion its more important that the less bags security has to screen the more attention they can pay to the ones they do screen

5828637 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
5828638 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
5828639 no one should be afraid of this if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west
5828640 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
5828641 the wave of patriotism hitting the airlines lately would be heart warming if not for the fact that all that seems to be motivating them is a desire to avoid any more bad pr
5828642 for the first time in ages i wasnt lugging around a heavy carry on and you know what it was wonderful we didnt have to worry if the were the right size and weight we didnt have to lug them throughout the terminal navigating a restroom with a carry on is never fun and we didnt have to line up at the gate extra early to be sure thered be room in the overhead bins what a sense of freedom
5828643 tom horton amrs executive vice president of finance and planning and chief financial officer said american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
5828644 enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on airfares from record fuel costs
5828645 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases we believe the proposed penalties are excessive
5828646 waiving the fee for a 3rd checked bag for military personnel traveling on northwest airlines is under consideration
5828647 customers and communities will gain improved access to 207 new international destinations just by our ability to link our networks
5828648 greater opportunities to earn and redeem your aadvantage miles on each airlines transatlantic flights
5828649 this is a pricing matter we cant discuss future plans
5828650 many military have government travel cards that can be used for fees

5828672 weve talked about how to conduct ourselves socially and we continue to work hard towards that
5828673 certainly our players have an understanding that the incidents that happened this summer we are not proud of and it is not going to continue
5828674 im excited about our running backs theres going to be some young speed guys who work hard
5828675 to build our team with the young skill guys that we have
5828676 i would much rather come into a new situation where we have experience on the offensive front and experience on the defensive front and have young inexperience at the skill positions because we know the offensive line and the defensive line really control the game

5828693 hey did you see the naked woman on the way in
5828694 when they saw that independence air was adding flights they added more flights and padded their schedules with the thought there might be more delays
5828695 we are not pleased with our performance we have to deliver a schedule customers want to fly and fly reliably
5828696 its really simple things that tell the hotel guests that the hotel is thinking about them
5828697 checking in is a big sore spot for travelers the last thing frequent travelers want is an involved process when checking in
5828698 life happens business meetings get changed a child gets sick sometimes a trip isnt taken
5828699 with the other airlines im stuck and i lose that money

5828703 those miles could ultimately be lost people who have enough miles for an award should cash them sooner rather than later

5828723 more than 20 us dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
5828724 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5828725 the price must be maintained at a level close to 100 us dollars because the costs have increased
5828726 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5828727 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5828728 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its groove back
5828729 the same way this market seemingly overreacted to every bullish nugget of information on the way up it is now ignoring those same nuggets on the way down
5828730 new building codes enacted by new york city accounted for the big jump in permits and starts in june julys 23 6 per cent drop in multi family starts and 32 4 per cent drop in multi family building permits is mostly payback for junes strong numbers

5828734 determined to safeguard the interests of holcim and its local employees in accordance with the bilateral investment protection agreements in place between switzerland and venezuela
5828735 we are working as a team with the venezuelan government to follow the rising construction market in venezuela
5828736 i think there is still room for negotiation we are not at the point of no return
5828737 the cemex case is very complicated but the numbers which we are using for it are close to the governments offer
5828738 for not following an mlb team and rooting for players instead
5828739 they were betting that thatcher stone was some ignorant jerk who didnt know how to get money out of continental
5828740 i wonder how much i would be able to get for it on ebay then
5828741 the fares are going to go up they have to
5828742 think of independence air as being a two year long santa claus to small communities well santa claus just ran out of money
5828743 other airlines have to honor the tickets thats the law but i cant predict what other airlines will do
5828744 my fear with random searches is that the searches become very inconsistent and nonsensical
5828745 after september 11 they were a massive hassle and an unjustified intrusion
5828746 what a riot i can take my little scissors now but im searched because i am dressed weird that day
5828747 i dont think any of this will make us a bit safer
5828748 i traveled 15 feet and lost a 7 000 diamond wedding ring they looked on the ground and conveyer belt nothing i thought i was in a secure area
5828749 tsa maintains a zero tolerance policy for theft in the workplace we aggressively investigate all allegations of misconduct and when infractions are discovered the offenders are immediately removed from service
5828750 thats one of the reasons you test something to see what kind of impact it might have
5828751 theres a potential for it to go negatively we also want to see what customers value
5828752 whats next i sneeze and ask for a kleenex and they tell me thatll be 1
5828753 eventually its going to be this is how much you pay for your ticket and that just gets you transportation you will need to pay for everything else
5828754 the airlines are really being bold even with agreements right now theyre all really pressed to get their revenues up as much as they can
5828755 you shouldnt have to take out a home equity loan to fly up to pittsburgh and back on the same day
5828756 a lot of the traffic that has leaked away from bwi has come back
5828757 we were seeing revenue declines in the early part of 2005 but now were seeing healthy gains at bwi that were pleased with
5828758 i can now sit in my hotel room in seattle and watch a redskins game in real time just like i would if i were home
5828759 to avoid hard feelings give this one only to someone you really love and who really loves you
5828760 this is a convenience and time saver for our customers
5828761 this is being done to recoup the cost of lost fuel
5828762 it ticked me off that after i told them i bought the gas the fee still showed up i had to go in and show them the receipt and everything
5828763 our passengers were less tolerant of the smaller planes which is why were going for the 70 seaters
5828764 most travelers have their own ipods personal dvd players and laptops
5828765 this is great but there could be a little more luggage room
5828766 there are some 280 300 wimax deployments globally today and we own more than 210 of those
5828767 we did some 235 million in revenue last year we grew close to 30 percent in revenue and we have a similar projection this year of 25 to 30 percent growth we have lots of customers and we feel good about the market as it transitions from a fixed and portable market to a mobility based market
5828768 weve been in this market for a long time and when it comes to the performance and coverage and capacity that you see from most of our radio products nobody comes close
5828769 those are the main frequencies that are being used globally by the operators and not all of them have gone through certification yet
5828770 the wimax forum just opened certification for the 2 5 ghz frequency and we were one of the first vendors who got certified
5828771 for example when you look at the self install cpe that we have that cpe has an integrated six antenna technology built into it so it gives you a much better link budget several dbs actually when compared to our competitors
5828772 at the end of the day to the operator what matters is the cost the dollar per megabyte that theyre providing to their end customers so our equipment may be more expensive than some others vendors equipment or it may be cheaper than some other vendors equipment but at the end of the day youve got to look at how much coverage is it serving how many users is it serving and how many megabytes its providing
5828773 starting toward the end of this year youll start to see our portfolio grow with a lot of new devices coming from different partners we dont see ourselves as a terminal or a handset company so well be working with partners to do iot to bring about different solutions that we can offer to our customers
5828774 we are using schemes like rate adaptation a scheduler a mix of multiple antenna technologies
5828775 those kind of special techniques we are using really allow our base station to be much more powerful than our competitors
5828776 was briefly answered reasoning only from empirical philosophical and legal evidences
5828777 jesus would take an even more radical position on abortion than barack obama
5828778 the law orders all the offspring to be brought up and forbids women either to cause abortion or to make away with the fetus
5828779 a woman should not destroy the unborn babe in her belly nor after its birth throw it before the dogs or vultures
5828780 you shall love your neighbor more than your own life you shall not slay the child by abortion nor again shalt thou destroy it after it is born
5828781 the second commandment of the teaching you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not seduce boys you shall not commit fornication you shall not steal you shall not practice magic you shall not use potions you shall not procure an abortion nor destroy a newborn child
5828782 i saw women who produced children out of wedlock and who procured abortions
5828783 but women who resort to some sort of deadly abortion kill not only the embryos but along with it all human kindness
5828784 what reason would we have to commit murder when we say that women who induce abortions are murderers and will have to give account of it to god for the same person would not regard the fetus in the womb as a living thing and therefore an object of gods care and then kill it
5828785 in our case murder being once for all forbidden we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb while as yet the human being derives blood from other parts of the body for its sustenance to hinder birth is merely a speedier man killing nor does it matter whether you take away a life that is born or destroy one that is coming to the birth that is a man which is going to be one you have the fruit already in the seed
5828786 moreover those too who give drugs causing abortion are deliberate murderers themselves as well as those receiving the poison which kills the fetus
5828787 no word has the power to change the reality of things procured abortion is the deliberate and direct killing by whatever means it is carried out of a human being in the initial phase of his or her existence
5828788 even if all the world were to combine forces they could not bring about the conception of a single child in any womans womb nor cause it to be born that is wholly the work of god
5828789 the fetus though enclosed in the womb of its mother is already a human being and it is a most monstrous crime to rob it of the life which it has not yet begun to enjoy
5828790 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to life which god has bestowed on this nascent life and that is nothing but murder
5828791 nowhere does the bible prohibit abortion yet the bible clearly prohibits the killing of innocent people exodus 20 13 all that is necessary to prove a biblical prohibition of abortion is to demonstrate that the bible considers the unborn to be human beings
5828792 we cant read gods mind on this as a pastor id support people voting their conscience with a prayerful heart

5828817 we support the equally important role of bets on the upside and on the downside
5828818 we expected and intended to have no impact whatsoever on the direction of prices
5828819 overall its a good report but i believe the outlook still remains cloudy as far as the outlook goes theyre going to obviously see some impact from the rising dollar
5828820 that is going to influence their overseas revenue and will have some impact on their bottom line going forward but its difficult to assess
5828821 very strong results and strong guidance this is impressive in light of the stronger u s dollar which has been more of headwind to their business as opposed to a tailwind thats the big takeaway

5828830 the activities is plural so its definitely more than a one time deal but alleging a specific time and place and time and person involved yesterday
5828831 of course were going to determine whether or not he was a witness in criminal investigations and if the cases need to be reviewed so certainly were going to look at any collateral effects
5828832 after suffering summer of 88 burnout and avoiding most of the rave muntered years of 89 90 buying balearic tat and bleep records this is the sort of stuff i used to hear a certain little bespectacled scotsman play in a certain manchester nightclub when i started going out on a regular basis again or a really fit blonde haired bird play it upstairs at a certain flying do in notts or a bearded bloke in london etc etc
5828833 this was not only a grievous injustice but a shame on the state of iowa and the federal government
5828834 these were good decent people who were also the most defenseless
5828835 the difference between them and anybody who is in jail is that in jail the government pays for them but if theyre on the streets we pay for them
5828836 what kind of a government makes prisoners of 43 mothers who all have children and then says you cant work you cant leave and cant stay that boggles the imagination
5828837 it is the most difficult most challenging situation i have ever faced and yet strangely the incident that has been most strengthening of my faith it shows there are a lot of compassionate people because if there werent we wouldnt be able to do what were doing
5828838 they arbitrarily enforce a law when its a well known truth that there are millions of illegal workers they could step into los angeles tomorrow and pick up a million people
5828839 this was their last option they would not have chosen this as their first option they wanted to feed their families scripture tells us to feed the hungry give drink to the thirsty give shelter to the shelterless if you and your family were starving what would you do
5828840 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5828841 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5828842 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5828843 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5828844 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5828845 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5828846 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5828847 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5828848 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5828849 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5828850 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5828851 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5828852 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5828853 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5828854 its kind of to be determined the thing that will keep us here will be quality
5828855 im not sure theyre really direct competitors even though they have the same warehouse method
5828856 if you buy too much of something and dont use it it costs you more
5828857 when times are hard and people are trying to stretch their dollar thats when we shine
5828858 this club has been here a very long time and has a large membership base im seeing more and more of those business owners because they need their money to go further
5828859 they have wonderful food items and its a higher quality than sams
5828860 the whole idea is to create a show so you can see them
5828861 were a very efficient business we buy right and we price right
5828862 i am not the only one who didnt get the medical care i needed it was routine to wait weeks or months for even basic care
5828863 they carried him in shackles to a car bruising his arms and legs
5828864 it was without a doubt the most uncomfortable flight ive ever had
5828865 flying today is a real chore by any definition and one to be avoided if possible i dont believe the airlines are helping themselves in the long run by making the passenger more miserable
5828866 why do the physically challenged or larger sized travelers need to fold themselves up just to use the facilities on a flight
5828867 i dont think the airlines need more seats they need more service that returns some measure of passenger dignity to the postmodern experience of air travel
5828868 domestically everyone is trying to reach that middle ground where you get revenue and satisfy your customers

5828872 apple has determined that in very rare cases batteries in first generation ipod nanos sold between september 2005 and december 2006 can overheat causing failure and deformation of the ipod nano
5828873 apple has received very few reports of such incidents less than 0 001 percent of first generation ipod nano units which have been traced back to a single battery supplier there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model

5828900 after drinking more alcohol the four ended up in a bedroom of the residence with all four engaging in mutually consented sexual conduct
5828901 at one point while the four were engaged in sex in the bedroom salinas started arguing with the defendant and the two men started pushing each other while still naked
5828902 gave varying and conflicting accounts on how the fight started
5828903 he could detect the odor of intoxicants emitted from the defendant that was the odor associated with someone sobering up after a long night of drinking
5828904 eyes were bloodshot and glossy and he complained of feeling hung over his shorts were covered in blood

5828924 as usual we covered the baby up in a blanket and sent it to the morgue so that the family could take her with them and do whatever they want according to their religious beliefs
5828925 when i came to the morgue to collect her her body was wrapped up
5828926 then my wife out of an inexplicable impulse asked to see her again at first i didnt want to break her heart but then i went up when i got there she realized she was moving
5828927 her pulse was slow and she was almost not breathing so she needed to be treated

5828973 what if you dropped the shields and sent a feedback charge directly into the engine core just as runner 1 exploded
5828974 you need to have your people to the escape pods they are being fitted with cryo units for stasis the grenna will oversee to the launch
5828975 if we live through this brian well worry about that then
5828976 initially it wont represent a lot of volume but tazo is a good brand and will be a good addition to the portfolio
5828977 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5828978 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5828979 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5828980 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
5828981 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about

5828989 primul ministru calin popescu tariceanu a semnat luni 18 august 2008 o decizie privind eliberarea lui dan cristian georgescu din functia de presedinte al autoritatii nationale pentru reglementare in comunicatii si tehnologia informatiei decizia intra in vigoare la data publicarii in monitorul oficial al romaniei
5828990 atunci cand muller a intrat pe piata angliei a durat cinci ani pana la constructia fabricii pentru noi este important acum sa construim brandul muller un nume aproape necunoscut in romania si abia atunci cand acesta va atinge un grad mare de notorietate ne vom gandi la propria capacitate de productie
5828991 in 1999 m am intors in israel dar am continuat sa vin in romania aproape in fiecare an in vacante in 2007 cand am venit sa incepem dezvoltarea muller in romania am crezut ca va fi usor tocmai pentru ca mai dezvoltasem anterior alte trei companii aici dupa doua zile insa mi am dat seama ca trebuia sa uit tot ce stiam despre romania si sa invat din nou totul de la zero romania s a schimbat foarte mult in doar sapte ani
5828992 din cei 80 de angajati doar trei suntem de origine israeliana eu vicepresedintele de marketing si directorul financiar restul echipei este in intregime romana
5828993 in prezent acoperim aproximativ 80 85 din lanturile de magazine internationale din tara urmand sa fim prezenti in toate pana la finalul anului
5828994 chiar daca exista o mare varietate de produse acestea sunt similare in mare parte lasand loc pentru inovatie in plus piata lactatelor este foarte dinamica si desi iaurtul este un produs traditional consumul continua sa fie scazut pentru a ne putea numara printre primii trei jucatori vom avea nevoie cu siguranta de investitii substantiale in marketing
5828995 investitiile brute ale mol romania in dezvoltarea retelei de benzinarii excluzand costul terenului sunt de aproximativ 150 de milioane de euro

5828999 the potential role of arsenic in diabetes development is supported by experimental and mechanistic evidence
5829000 from a public health perspective confirmation of a role for arsenic in diabetes development would add to the concerns posed by the carcinogenic cardiovascular developmental and reproductive effects of inorganic arsenic in drinking water and could substantially modify risk assessment and risk benefit analyses estimating the consequences of arsenic exposure
5829001 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
5829002 stemming the pandemic of type 2 diabetes is a public health priority and will require a multifaceted approach
5829003 this must include improving the understanding of the etiology of diabetes and identifying modifiable factors that can be incorporated into prevention strategies
5829004 to date this approach has focused on medication and lifestyle modification but the role of environmental exposures must also be considered
5829005 while many questions remain about the role of arsenic in diabetogenesis they can only be answered by additional research
5829006 in the meantime arsenic exposure from drinking water is a widespread environmental pollutant that affects millions of individuals around the world
5829007 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched
5829008 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
5829009 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5829010 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
5829011 this work represents a radical improvement over prior work presented by this firm in incorporating a protective layer that drastically lowers the solar absorptance to an acceptable value
5829012 the variable emittance electrochromic technology is an entirely new technology pioneered by this firm to the best of our knowledge no other group has done any work in this area
5829013 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft

5829034 developing strategies to improve the prediction and diagnoses of dementia has paramount therapeutic and public health implications
5829035 when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy normative samples to determine cognitive impairment however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5829036 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of incident dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period mean average 3 3 years
5829037 on the basis of the consensus clinical diagnostic procedures 47 participants developed incident dementia of the alzheimer type and 18 participants developed incident vascular dementia during the study 128 individuals died as expected for the age of this cohort of these 18 had developed incident dementia
5829038 in summary within person across neuropsychological test variability was associated with development of dementia independently of performance of the neuropsychological tests this finding needs to be replicated in different populations before it is applied in a clinical setting
5829039 prevention strategies often focus on modifiable risk factors for colonization and aspiration and can successfully reduce ventilator associated pneumonia rates but no single strategy completely eliminates ventilator associated pneumonia
5829040 adherence to prevention guidelines is variable due to costs and lack of education resources and leadership
5829041 in conclusion the results of this large randomized multicenter study demonstrated that the silver coated endotracheal tube significantly reduced the incidence of microbiologically confirmed ventilator associated pneumonia and had its greatest benefit during the peak time of ventilator associated pneumonia occurrence without any notable adverse events
5829042 the silver coated endotracheal tube appears to offer a unique approach because it is the first intervention that becomes user dependent after intubation requiring no further action by the clinician
5829043 based on the results of this trial should clinicians reconsider guidelines for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and use a silver coated endotracheal tube in all patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation in the icu
5829044 the answer is probably yes for the subset of patients at very high risk of developing early onset ventilator associated pneumonia such as neurologically impaired patients or trauma patients because the greatest effect of the intervention appeared to occur during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation and was clinically relevant with minimal effect on clinician workload
5829045 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit of silver coated endotracheal tubes
5829046 consequently silver coated tubes should not be viewed as the definitive answer for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and until additional data confirm the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of these devices their issue should be restricted to high risk patients treated in icus with benchmark value based infection rates that remain above institutional goals despite implementation of a comprehensive strategy of usual preventive measures to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia

5829085 kurt and i hadnt been dating that long back in 2003 when he invited me to come to bristol for the night race on aug 23 2003 i took him up on the offer but really didnt know what to expect having the bristol night race as a first race experience was impressive enough but to be there and see kurt win in my first time to the track was extra special theres always something special about coming to bristol and i think there will always be the night race there is just unbelievable you have to experience it to believe it as exciting and impressive as it is on tv theres just no way to do it justice you really have to be there to witness it live i guess you could say that i got spoiled pretty fast at bristol kurt won the night race in 2003 and we came back for the spring race of 2004 and he won that one too i know just how much kurt loves the track and that affection for bristol has certainly rubbed off on me through the years thats for sure

5829111 we are very pleased with the first half results because even though market shares have been discussed quite a lot it becomes increasingly clear that a strategy to constantly and significantly improve profitability is much healthier
5829112 we do not have specific targets because the market changes we need to look at the other players and we can no longer use annual plans but must analyse the situation every few months
5829113 we all behaved in the same way until recently now one can clearly see who is after market share by assets which can no longer be gained unless one compromises the quality of the loan portfolio or profitability on the other side are banks with a more balanced approach

5829160 putem fi foarte multumiti de rezultatele pe primul semestru pentru ca desi s a vorbit foarte mult despre cote de piata devine tot mai clar ca este mult mai sanatoasa o strategie de imbunatatire constanta si semnificativa a profitabiltitatatii
5829161 nu avem tinte anume pentru ca piata se schimba trebuie sa ne uitam si la ceilalti jucatori si nu mai putem merge dupa planuri anuale ci analizam situatia la intervale de cateva luni
5829162 pana de curand toti ne comportam la fel acum se vede bine cine vrea neaparat cota de piata dupa active iar aceasta nu mai poate fi castigata decat prin compromiterea calitatii portofoliului de credite sau a profitabilitatii de cealalta parte se disting bancile cu o abordare mai echilibrata
5829163 nu suntem cei mai agresivi dar tocmai faptul ca nu excelam fie pe credit de consum fie pe ipotecare constituie un atu pentru ca daca piata se schimba sau noile norme ale bnr vor afecta mai mult anumite tipuri de credite o abordare universala de produs ne poate ajuta sa absorbim mai bine eventuale socuri
5829164 nu avem o deteriorare a portofoliului pentru ca ne am concentrat pe active care sa ne aduca un echilibru intre risc si marja
5829165 am facut o atat pentru a obtine lichiditati cat si pentru a putea oferi clientilor costuri de finantare la nivelul pietei
5829166 noi nu recurgem la acele practici promotionale de a oferi dobanzi scazute pe perioade de sase douasprezece luni pe care nu le consider nici sanatoase nici etice dar pentru a avea si noi produse cu dobanzi mai joase competitive recurgem la varianta francilor
5829167 tocmai intr o asemenea perspectiva este bine sa ai eficienta ridicata ca sa ai de unde sa dai daca apar probleme
5829168 in primul semestru al anului trecut politele de risc financiar reprezentau 40 din primele brute subscrise iar acum ponderea lor este sub 1 din mai anul trecut nu mai incheiem astfel de asigurari pentru ca riscul de neplata era foarte mare lucru care ne afecta profitabilitatea am decis sa reorientam afacerile companiei si sa restructuram portofoliul astfel incat sa crestem profitabilitatea

5829184 aug 21 2008 10 am aug 20 2008 to aug 22 2008 venus sextile moon you are apt to feel very romantic now and seem to live in a world of harmony and fun your surroundings are bright and happy and small daily things help to maintain your good mood these could include receiving a gift or a call or have a special and meaningful encounter you achieve balance at this time harmony between your family responsibilities and your need to be loved amused and open this all brings a better emotional balance to your life and gives you the chance to develop some excellent relationships with family and potential lovers you are particularly sensitive to other peoples feelings and emotional states increasing your psychic connection with them though you have altruistic and pure feelings now you still will want to have fun and amusement as a way to release your creative energies make a list of fun things to do go out to the theater plan a vacation or take a class take some time to notice and be grateful for all the good things that are coming your way now this will increase their importance in your life and help you magnify their effect concentrate on the positive and the good what is good for your emotional ties rather than looking to what you dont have or would like to have be happy that you have what you have remember humans cannot be perfect

5829202 oui jai entendu parler de cette histoire vous pouvez entrer au paradis
5829203 parallels between the lives of paul and david brainerd are striking they are too numerous to be merely a coincidence their mutual and equal commitment to the power of the gospel the necessity of a clear and undeniable call a ministry of suffering and an unsurpassing confidence in christ drove them
5829204 to expect great things from god and to attempt great things for god
5829205 there was no shame of christ in the gospel of paul there was no shame of christ in the gospel of david brainerd and there should be no shame of christ in our gospel
5829206 if you do not have the same certainty of your calling when tough times come you will run
5829207 keep that which i have entrusted to him until that day
5829208 paul knew he was at lifes end he was in the twilight of life and though many things were uncertain one thing he knew for sure i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep what i have committed to him until that day
5829209 paul has placed his life his eternal destiny in the hands of a sovereign god a god he is confident will keep him no matter what and no matter when come life or death he is secure in the god who is able at the end of his life david brainerd had the same assurances as paul
5829210 this is how brainerd lived and how he died no wonder he wrote oh how precious is time
5829211 it is wisely said he lives long who lives well by that measurement david brainerd lived long my hope and prayer is that we will live long too
5829212 he is truly a christian gentleman his character is marked by wisdom humility and grace
5829213 the collection is closed because it has come to our attention that there is restricted material in the collection once the collection has been processed it will be open to any patron interested in viewing it
5829214 truly i say to you as you did it not to one of the least of these you did it not to me
5829215 the least in america are literally and symbolically present in black people to say that christ is black means that black people are gods poor people whom christ has come to liberate and thus no gospel of jesus christ is possible in america without coming to terms with the history and culture of that people who struggled to bear witness to his name in extreme circumstances
5829216 christ is black therefore not because of some cultural or psychological need of black people but because and only because christ really enters into our world where the poor the despised and the black are disclosing that he is with them enduring their humiliation and pain and transforming oppressed slaves into liberated servants indeed if christ is not truly black then the historical jesus lied
5829217 if twentieth century christians are to speak the truth for their socio historical situation they cannot merely repeat the story of what jesus did and said in palestine as if it were self interpreting for us today truth is more than the retelling of the biblical story truth is the divine happening that invades our contemporary situation revealing the meaning of the past for the present so that we are made new creatures for the future
5829218 our church is an impostor because we no longer believe the gospel we proclaim
5829219 black theology cannot accept a view of god which does not represent god as being for oppressed blacks and thus against white oppressors
5829220 there is no use for a god who loves white oppressors the same as oppressed blacks
5829221 there is no use for a god who loves nazis the same as the jews they killed
5829222 there is no use for a god who loves communists as much as the church it has persecuted
5829223 there is no use for a god who loves muslim terrorists as much as the people they kill
5829224 what we need is the divine love as expressed in black power which is the power of blacks to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal unless god is participating in this holy activity we must reject gods love
5829225 by their poets feigned to be inanimated inhabited or possessed by some spirit or another
5829226 see we screwed other people and theyre getting over it why cant you
5829227 but it is high time those who live middle class lives among african americans started teaching responsibility to their brethren
5829228 my circumstances have made me who i am and it is the motivating factor of my success
5829229 id love to start a school unfortunately the aint here and besides one cannot raise a family on private school dough
5829230 what are you going to do with the youth who cannot afford better private schools
5829231 we all need to be aware of the differences that exist between us all and the reasons for why they are if we are to ever see the end to racism and if we are ever to see a united church
5829232 the first amendment does not give political parties a right to have their nominees designated as such on the ballot ballots serve primarily to elect candidates not as forms of political expression
5829233 its one way we can make use of the current system
5829234 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
5829235 if you have a green party i want to join
5829236 be very careful if you make a woman cry because god counts her tears the woman came out of a mans rib not from his feet to be walked on not from his head to be superior but from the side to be equal under the arm to be protected and next to the heart to be loved
5829237 what is impressive about the amish is how the community stays together
5829238 this blessing would be poured out for only the next two minutes
5829239 he said the service would yield millionaires and billionaires within 24 hours everyone had to donate 1 000 because an exceptional blessing rested on 1 000
5829240 people stormed to the front poor people rich people people from all sections of our society he koontz said god would bless the peoples credit cards and they would be able to rule over south africa with their money eventually there were no fewer than 1 000 people who made such donations
5829241 lately ive heard some christians say that its time to stop putting the critical spotlight on people like benny hinn weve already established that their christian bona fides are suspect why waste our time
5829242 snivelling quislings by authoritarian pastors who warn them against speaking against
5829243 you might as well deal with me now cause i aint going away
5829244 god it doesnt seem like it it sure doesnt seem like you care but i know you i trust you i believe in you and so im going to act as in faith im going to ask again and again if need be and im going to trust that you do know what i need im going to trust that you do care not just about me but about the very ones i care about so much im going to stay here and pray and await your response
5829245 why should we have to beg if god is so good whats all this about
5829246 if you get a federal grant you cant use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you cant discriminate against them or against the people you hire on the basis of their religion
5829247 groups that believe hiring only members of their own faith is essential to their social service mission would remain free to do so as long as they do not take federal funds mr obama is right to want to tap into the power of faith based groups to deliver social services he is also right to want to prevent government funds from being used to subsidize discriminatory practices his position strikes a sensible balance in a delicate area
5829248 obamas new movement is the same old socialistic usurpation as before disguised as aid and starting out as voluntary except for the funding source but now targeted at the most vulnerable section of society the section that really does earnestly wish to improve things
5829249 according to an hhs memo leaked to the new york times july 15 robert pear the bush administration wants to require that all hospitals and birth control clinics receiving federal health funds certify that they will not
5829250 the faith based initiative is an insidious intrusion into the separation of church and state that was established by the first amendment to our constitution
5829251 heres this semesters prayer look it over and get back to me if you have any questions
5829252 before you go there are a couple of things you might be able to clarify
5829253 whats our policy for those children who dont want to participate
5829254 those children who want to abstain should silently reflect on whatever they choose while the prayer is being recited
5829255 i dont expect all of the students to sit quietly through this last quarter both eli and abdullah objected quite vocally
5829256 just have your teaching assistant take them out into the hallway during the prayer there is no reason for them to be uncooperative besides i dont think youll have any problems with abdulla
5829257 no not at all look ive got to deliver the rest of these prayers save your questions for this afternoons meeting well be distributing your clocks and rugs then
5829258 teachers led the kids into the gym where a man dressed in white with a white cap who had been at the school all day
5829259 was prostrating himself in prayer on a carpet as the students entered
5829260 the kids were corralled by adults and required to go to the assembly where prayer occurred
5829261 when i arrived i was told after school we have islamic studies and i might have to stay for hall duty
5829262 the teachers had written assignments on the blackboard for classes like math and social studies islamic studies was the last one
5829263 10 answers to the question is the church still relevant
5829264 on the 14th of august 2008 an anonymous man called my home in france as my daughters played hide and seek in the garden this stranger spoke to my husband warning him that your wife is in great danger these ships will be blown up my husband asked how it was this person had obtained our private home number no response was forthcoming but the illicit threats carried on
5829265 the mission is to break the israeli siege an absolutely illegal siege which has plunged a million and a half palestinians into wretched conditions imprisoned in their own homes exposed to extreme military violence deprived of the basic necessities of life stripped of their most fundamental human rights and dignity
5829266 this is why i an israeli jew felt compelled to join this voyage to break the siege
5829267 ordinary people have often played key roles in history particularly in situations like this where governments shirk their responsibilities my voyage to gaza is a statement of solidarity with the palestinian people in their time of suffering but it also conveys a message to my fellow citizens
5829268 come my friends tis not too late to seek a newer world push off and sitting well in order smite the sounding furrows for my purpose holds to sail beyond the sunset
5829269 no one is paying attention to whats happening in gaza no one is listening to palestinians they are slowly being strangled by israel and no one is even listening we need to find ways to connect people in the middle east particularly young people to people and groups in wealthier countries together we can inspire each other and together we can be much more than we are alone
5829270 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support
5829271 i think about rachel corrie and about what israel may do to us i know its risky but i take a risk when i ride a motorcycle and i think that if were really going to change things then somebody has to begin putting something on the line for that change to happen
5829272 the idea of sailing to gaza is kind of crazy but its also very straight forward
5829273 this mission is an amazing opportunity to have a huge impact on this hard locked heart locked crisis ive never been to gaza myself but i know that gaza is the forgotten little brother of the middle east or at least of the israeli palestinian crisis everything about this crisis is clearer in gaza the israeli occupation strategy is much clearer in gaza because its not specifically about taking more land its mostly about completely destroying a people

5829290 syaikhul islam hafidz al ashr abu al fadhl ahmad bin hajar al asqalani ditanya tentang peringatan maulid maka dia menjawab
5829291 pada dasarnya peringatan maulid adalah bidah karena tidak seorangpun dari ulama salafusholih 3 abad pertama yang melakukannya
5829292 adapun saya mengembalikan masalah ini kepada sumber pokoknya yaitu sebuah hadits yang diriwayatkan dalam shahihain dari nabi shalallahu alaihi wa sallam diriwayatkan dari ibnu abbas radhiallahu anhu berkata
5829293 hari ini adalah hari kemenangan yang telah diberikan oleh allah kepada nabi musa alaihi salam dan kaum bani israel dari firaun
5829294 kami lebih berhak daripada kamu dan nabi musa dalam hal ini
5829295 jauhilah kalian setiap yang perkara yang baru karena setiap perkara baru adalah bidah dan setiap bidah adalah sesat
5829296 aku pernah menyaksikan nabi shalallahu alaihi wa sallam membuka imamah dari kepalanya dan mengusap ubun ubun
5829297 nabi wudhu lalu mengusap imamah beserta ubun ubun dan khufnya
5829298 jika seorang wanita mengkhawatirkan hawa dingin dan kondisi lain yang serupa ia boleh mengusap tutup kepalanya sesungguhnya ummu salamah pernah mengusap tutup kepalanya sebaiknya selain mengusap tutup kepalanya ia juga mengusap sedikit rambutnya tetapi jika ia tidak terdesak terpaksa darurat untuk melakukannya maka tentang persoalan ini terdapat silang pendapat di kalangan para ulama
5829299 thariq bin syihab melihat nabi shalallahu alaihi wa sallam namun tidak mendengar satupun haditsnya
5829300 pernyataan abu dawud ini tidak merusak keabsahan hadits karena jika benar ia tidak mendengar satu haditspun dari nabi shalallahu alaihi wa sallam maka haditsnya adalah mursal shahabi dan mursal shahabi dapat menjadi hujjah menurut madzhab syafii dan seluruh ulama kecuali abu ishaq al isfirayini
5829301 ini tidak merusak keabsahannya karena ia termasuk mursal shahabi dan mursal shahabi hujjah sedangkan hadits ini shahih atas syarat syaikhan al bukhari dan muslim
5829302 seakan akan karena inilah hadits ini dishahihkan banyak ulama sebagaimana terdapat di dalam at talkhish
5829303 ini sanad yang shahih seluruh perawinya tsiqah bisa dipercaya kecuali maula keluarga az zubair saya belum mengetahuinya jika ia seorang sahabat maka ketidakjelasannya tidak berpengaruh dan ini yang rajih karena perawi beliau adalah abu hazim salman al asyjai al kufi seorang tabiin namun apabila ia bukan seorang sahabat maka sanadnya lemah karena kemajhulannya ketidakjelasannya
5829304 hadits ini sangat gharib tidak kami ketahui kecuali dari hadits ibnu lahiah dengan sanad ini dan ia adalah lemah
5829305 menurut saya penyebutan abu musa dalam sanad tersebut adalah syadz atau mungkar karena ubaid bin muhammad al ijli telah menyelisihi abu dawud dengan penyebutan nama abu musa dan saya belum mendapati orang yang menulis biografinya apalagi jamaah ulama yang meriwayatkan dari ishaq bin manshur tidak menyebut nama abu musa
5829306 jika telah terbukti ia berjumpa dengan nabi shalallahu alaihi wa sallam maka menurut pendapat yang rajah dia adalah sahabat dan apabila terbukti tidak mendangar hadits langsung darinya nabi maka riwayatnya dari nabi shalallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah mursal shahabi dan menurut pendapat yang rajih mursal shahabi dapat diterima

5829317 i dont know if any of those injured guys will be out there on the 7th but my guess is they will be

5829353 there is perhaps nothing more reprehensible than an act in exploitation of children those members of our society who because of their age and inexperience are especially vulnerable to manipulation and deceit

5829359 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
5829360 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
5829361 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilize both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data
5829362 at its peak ipv6 represented less than one hundredth of 1 percent of internet traffic

5829368 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5829369 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5829370 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons

5829393 we ve get a lot of people that come in on the train just to try some of the ales we have
5829394 they can come in have a few and then don t have to worry about driving home
5829395 we don t yet have the enrollment we d like to see at this time of year
5829396 we know they re out there it s just they haven t gotten word
5829397 it s not always one of those priorities when they get here and when their kids are not school age
5829398 i can t emphasize strongly enough the importance of registering or re registering your children for school
5829399 i m looking to hopefully have a grand opening on sept 9
5829400 probably one of the most important things you can do is getting that kind into this environment getting them into this school and getting them into a routine they can get used to
5829401 we have a lot of kids who have been hanging around and looking for something to do
5829402 this is their hub and their safe place they re looking forward to this and they want to see their buddies
5829403 i like being around americans i have some interest in going to american school
5829404 my wife and i figured as long as we re here why send them to english schools then they get the benefit of a whole different experience that will influence them the rest of their lives
5829405 it s a wonderful school system just as good as the american

5829409 an estimated 2 000 to 2 500 u s congregations now operate multiple campuses and many of them like buckhead church are so called video venues the leadership network a christian nonprofit that follows these multisite churches says there will be 30 000 of them within a few years
5829410 the unorthodox arrangement relieves young pastors of the burden of writing and delivering a weekly sermon leaving them more time to spend with their members staffs and families for christians looking to create community on a more intimate level video venues do present an alternative to the suburban megaflock
5829411 using video goes against a critical tenet of protestant faith the priesthood of all believers instead of a real experience it offers a mediated one that inherently puts the pastor in a position of greater power over the masses
5829412 kristen and i ran into each other and we did discuss a veronica movie its very tough to focus on it right now with two pilots on my plate but as soon as i have any free time thats my top priority

5829414 the playstation 4 and xbox 720 will arrive in 2011 or 2012 we think
5829415 this is just our estimate we dont know and even if microsoft and sony told us i couldnt say because it would be under nda
5829416 but we think in three to four years time although there are good reasons why it should be 2010 already but well see
5829417 the difference is that the republican candidate is a critic of the drugmakers instead of an ally as in the past leaving the industry without a champion because obama also has taken positions at odds with the pharmaceutical companies

5829434 developing strategies to improve the prediction and diagnoses of dementia has paramount therapeutic and public health implications
5829435 when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy normative samples to determine cognitive impairment however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5829436 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of incident dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period mean average 3 3 years
5829437 on the basis of the consensus clinical diagnostic procedures 47 participants developed incident dementia of the alzheimer type and 18 participants developed incident vascular dementia during the study 128 individuals died as expected for the age of this cohort of these 18 had developed incident dementia
5829438 in summary within person across neuropsychological test variability was associated with development of dementia independently of performance of the neuropsychological tests this finding needs to be replicated in different populations before it is applied in a clinical setting
5829439 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes
5829440 while prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal these findings add to the existing concerns about the long term health consequences of low and moderate exposure to inorganic arsenic
5829441 arsenic exposure and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in us adults
5829442 vap is a relatively common infection and increasingly one caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria
5829443 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
5829444 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology
5829445 the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body
5829446 typically when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy individuals to determine cognitive impairment
5829447 however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5829448 we know that level of performance on tests of memory attention and executive function predicts dementia however this study showed for the first time that the degree of variability in performance across neuropsychological tests measured within a person improved the prediction of dementia above and beyond ones level of performance on each test alone
5829449 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period which on average was 3 3 years
5829450 this figure is in line with what wed expect for the incidence of dementia in this population
5829451 prevention strategies often focus on modifiable risk factors for colonization and aspiration and can successfully reduce ventilator associated pneumonia rates but no single strategy completely eliminates ventilator associated pneumonia
5829452 adherence to prevention guidelines is variable due to costs and lack of education resources and leadership
5829453 in conclusion the results of this large randomized multicenter study demonstrated that the silver coated endotracheal tube significantly reduced the incidence of microbiologically confirmed ventilator associated pneumonia and had its greatest benefit during the peak time of ventilator associated pneumonia occurrence without any notable adverse events
5829454 the silver coated endotracheal tube appears to offer a unique approach because it is the first intervention that becomes user dependent after intubation requiring no further action by the clinician
5829455 based on the results of this trial should clinicians reconsider guidelines for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and use a silver coated endotracheal tube in all patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation in the icu
5829456 the answer is probably yes for the subset of patients at very high risk of developing early onset ventilator associated pneumonia such as neurologically impaired patients or trauma patients because the greatest effect of the intervention appeared to occur during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation and was clinically relevant with minimal effect on clinician workload
5829457 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit of silver coated endotracheal tubes
5829458 consequently silver coated tubes should not be viewed as the definitive answer for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and until additional data confirm the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of these devices their issue should be restricted to high risk patients treated in icus with benchmark value based infection rates that remain above institutional goals despite implementation of a comprehensive strategy of usual preventive measures to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia

5829469 observational studies have demonstrated that the concentration of total homocysteine in blood is associated with risk of coronary artery disease and stroke
5829470 to evaluate the effects of homocysteine lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin b12 on mortality and cardiovascular events
5829471 mean average plasma total homocysteine concentration was reduced by 30 percent after 1 year of treatment in the groups receiving folic acid and vitamin b12
5829472 during a median midpoint 38 months of follow up the primary end point was experienced by a total of 422 participants 13 7 percent 219 participants 14 2 percent receiving folic acid vitamin b12 vs 203 13 1 percent not receiving such treatment and 200 participants 13 0 percent receiving vitamin b6 vs 222 14 3 percent not receiving vitamin b6
5829473 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events among patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing intensive conventional treatment we found a numerically lower incidence of stroke and higher incidence of cancer in the groups receiving folic acid but these observations were not statistically significant
5829474 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
5829475 the potential role of arsenic in diabetes development is supported by experimental and mechanistic evidence
5829476 from a public health perspective confirmation of a role for arsenic in diabetes development would add to the concerns posed by the carcinogenic cardiovascular developmental and reproductive effects of inorganic arsenic in drinking water and could substantially modify risk assessment and risk benefit analyses estimating the consequences of arsenic exposure
5829477 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
5829478 stemming the pandemic of type 2 diabetes is a public health priority and will require a multifaceted approach
5829479 this must include improving the understanding of the etiology of diabetes and identifying modifiable factors that can be incorporated into prevention strategies
5829480 to date this approach has focused on medication and lifestyle modification but the role of environmental exposures must also be considered
5829481 while many questions remain about the role of arsenic in diabetogenesis they can only be answered by additional research
5829482 in the meantime arsenic exposure from drinking water is a widespread environmental pollutant that affects millions of individuals around the world
5829483 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched

5829552 well indeed its a good news for both of you sunita your pregnancy is confirmed
5829553 is everything alright i hope there is not complication in your pregnancy
5829554 no everything is fine its just that i am not prepared
5829555 well its been just 5 months to our marriage i had so many dreams i am becoming mother at the age of 22 its ridiculous
5829556 well thats ok sunita you can pursue your dreams even after the baby
5829557 no everything will change i will have to spend more time with my kid there wont be enough time for myself the whole world would revolve around the baby once the delivery i am not prepared to be a mother i may not be that good a mother after all
5829558 no i have never seen him happier than he is now i am too afraid to talk to him he may start hating me if i say anything to him
5829559 so how are you feeling now has the nausea gone
5829560 yes i am better that way i went for an ultrasound yesterday rajesh was very happy to see the growth of the baby in my tummy
5829561 no i dont feel any kind of connection with the life growing inside me i am afraid i will be a bad mother i keep cursing the baby everyday i am not getting any motherly feeling
5829562 sunita atleast now you have to accept the reality you cannot act this way for whole of your life
5829563 what should i do radha i dont feel attached to the baby i am doing all this only for rajesh i am feeling very guilty but i cant help it
5829564 she was feeling sleepy so i made her sleep in one of the bedrooms above
5829565 no i dont hear anything did you guys hear anything
5829566 well there are some 100 people down there there is so much of noise and chaos down there nobody could here the baby crying but only you heard and you keep telling me that you are not able to connect to the baby sunita this is what motherhood is about

5829678 has shown on numerous occasions that he is so prejudiced and harbors such personal bias against jesse ray beard and the other five african american youths now known as the jena 6 that he is incapable of fairly and impartially performing his duties as the district attorney
5829679 has made numerous statements on numerous occasions in different procedural postures to numerous individuals which make clear he has pre judged not only jesse ray beards guilt but the disposition for jesse ray beard as well
5829680 millions of people turned their attention to the jena six last year but at the end of the day the system itself has to go on trial

5829704 it was great to see students around the nation mobilize in order to seek justice for the proper punishment for the jena
5829705 the politics are the same as they were before the case
5829706 students who were already actively involved with politics are aware of what is going on for others i think they were mainly involved only because of the hype surrounding the case so they are completely over it now
5829707 but politically aware students understand that jena is still a conservative southern baptist town that has little to no plans on changing their politics
5829708 the old whites are dying and the young whites are movin out pretty soon you got yourself a black majority used to be the east side was black and the west side was white with highway 71 as the divider but now a lot of black folks are buying homes on the west side that causes conflict a lot of whites dont want to live around blacks

5829723 le but supr me de lexistence des hommes nest pas la conservation dun etat cest la conservation de leur race
5829724 quand la race est en danger d tre opprim e ou m me limin e la question de la l galit ne joue plus quun r le secondaire dans ce cas il importe peu que le pouvoir existant applique des moyens absolument l gaux linstinct de conservation des opprim s sera toujours la justification la plus lev e de leur lutte par tous les moyens

5829732 jesse ray impressed me as a respectful and clear thinking young man
5829733 the argument was that the white kids who hung the noose had been tried lightly while the other kids were slammed
5829734 jena 6 is microcosmic for a social phenomenon how did we get to a place where we have 2 million people in prison and 700 000 are black and thats okay
5829735 our function is to be fair not to see white black male female it is to see justice
5829736 in a composite nation like ours made up of almost every variety of the human family there should be as before the law no rich no poor no high no low no black no white but one country one citizenship equal rights and a common destiny for all
5829737 the defendant today took responsibility for committing a federal hate crime by using a powerful symbol of hate to intimidate a group of interstate travelers because of their race
5829738 this has been an unusual court in that it has been looking at a lot of death penalty appeals
5829739 its a sign the court is acknowledging the problems with the death penalty in this country
5829740 the processing and adjudication of orphan petitions and advance processing orphan petitions is one of the top priorities for uscis each local office has an officer who is dedicated to processing orphan petitions if you have already filed a form i 600 petition to classify orphan as an immediate relative and or a form i 600a application for advance processing of orphan petition all inquiries should be sent by e mail to yakima adoptions dhs gov the adoption officer will respond to your inquiry within 2 business days

5829748 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5829749 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5829750 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5829751 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5829752 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defenses protecting the brain from infection
5829753 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5829754 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5829755 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5829756 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5829757 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5829758 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5829759 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb
5829760 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5829761 you dont have to worry about the dna going haywire
5829762 the ability to on demand make as much as you want is obviously very very attractive
5829763 we can currently generate up to a 100 billion red blood cells from a single six well plate of stem cells

5829765 it shows that the line leading to humans is not as special as many thought
5829766 after finding this kind of intelligence in apes many people thought it had developed once in one evolutionary line with humans at the end the bird studies show it has developed at least twice
5829767 there is no indication that this is a racially biased crime
5829768 if this was a scuffle the police wouldnt have gotten involved
5829769 but i dont think its isolated to hebron because these things happen at all schools
5829770 i guess he just lost control and his emotions got the better of him
5829771 we got up and got ready to go her attorneys came to pick her up but when she saw the media frenzy outside her house her anxiety sky rocketed

5829779 for skiers and riders who are time short during the day they can pop up to snow park in the evening to get their turns in being on snow at night under flood lights is quite thrilling and with relatively un crowded slopes and a hot meal available in the woolshed it will be a great alternative friday night out
5829780 we are pleased to announce record revenues for the year but obviously are not happy with the net income for the quarter or year license revenue fell off dramatically for the quarter compared to last year and slightly for the year which had a significant impact on both top line revenue and gross margin our support and services revenue continues to grow at a very healthy pace driven by our electronic processing services which include atm debit card bill payment and remote deposit capture our managers and employees continue their on going focus on our customers while also maintaining a focus on cost control during this challenging period
5829781 we continue to develop new products and enhance the features and depth of functionality in our existing products to meet our customers demands which also allow them to effectively compete with any financial institution obviously this means we have to continue to increase our spending on research and development which increased significantly for the quarter and the year however considering the impact of the two acquisitions we completed last year this line of expense only increased organically by 5 percent for the quarter and 15 percent for the year compared to the same periods a year ago
5829782 we believe these demands are a good sign that our customers look to us to fulfill their technology needs as we continue to focus on our primary strengths of providing the most powerful and flexible technology in the industry and our commitment to provide our clients with outstanding service
5829783 our managers did a good job of controlling our operating expenses during the year we had a one time write off of some fixed assets and above usual level of legal and accounting costs in the fourth quarter or the total dollar expense would have been basically flat for the quarter and those combined with additional personnel costs and higher user group costs caused the increase for the year compared to the prior year periods also selling and marketing expense increased at approximately the same pace as revenue for the year but considering the impact of the companies acquired during the year they only increased 5 percent and 7 percent organically for the quarter and year respectively
5829784 the drive behind the project is to get more people on the snow riding and having fun with burton as our partner and their ltr program in effect the new park is really going to draw the crowds besides we are all just super stoked we can now ride in beijing year round
5829785 the park will be as sick as we can make it the snow in qiaobo is surprisingly good and the management is stoked to have a new mellow park so its going to be a fun area for all levels of riding

5829804 in what remains a difficult environment for the home furnishings industry due to significant macroeconomic pressures we continue to be diligent in improving the efficiencies of our operations although our fiscal first quarter is historically our weakest we strengthened our operating performance during the period and expanded our margins on a 6 6 decline in sales while we anticipate it being some time before we see an across the board industry improvement we believe our balance sheet and the strength of our business model will carry us through this period
5829805 with the cellular conversion at our la z boy manufacturing facilities complete we are realizing the anticipated efficiencies throughout our production process in addition to the overall decline in volume the furniture industry including la z boy typically takes a one week plant shutdown for vacation in july which hampers the ability to absorb fixed overhead costs comparable to other quarters
5829806 our casegoods business continues to face significant challenges in this environment with bedroom and dining room group purchases typically higher ticket transactions than upholstered furniture it is apparent the consumer is postponing these purchases to a greater extent than they are other furniture categories our team remains committed to running the business with a cost structure aligned with the current lower volume environment and is focused on expanding its distribution to other channels
5829807 on a decline in sales our operating loss was flat against last year as we improved our gross margin in the segment with the costs of consolidating our warehouse and it systems behind us we have the ability to operate more efficiently throughout the year although we remain concerned about weaker consumer discretionary spending impacting our volume we continue to examine all aspects of the segments cost structure and are focused on improving its performance
5829808 the overall macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging increased oil prices higher interest rates and a depressed housing market combined with low consumer confidence levels are having an effect on the home furnishings industry across the board we remain committed to running our business with the greatest efficiency possible and believe we have the opportunity to improve our performance as we announced last quarter due to seasonality issues and the way in which our fiscal year may through april rolls out we anticipate the second half of our fiscal year to be operationally stronger than the first half
5829809 when it comes to supplier diversity arvinmeritor has set aggressive targets for on going investments with minority suppliers while were making good progress we still have room for improvement

5829811 the fcics approval of agrisure and other traited corn seeds acknowledges reduced risk for growers
5829812 we worked with john deere risk protection to create a better opportunity for growers to access crop insurance discounts a unified endorsement aligns with growers preferences for choice and the crop insurance industrys need for consistent policies across seed brands
5829813 the approval of this endorsement by the fcic should spark additional discussions regarding how technology can impact risk reduction regardless of the technology provider
5829814 we look forward to conversations that take into consideration the value of choice for growers importance of market competition and implementation considerations faced by the crop insurance industry
5829815 we applaud the work of syngenta john deere risk protection and the fcic and rma in extending access to the risk management biotechnology endorsement to growers across a wider portion of the corn belt
5829816 a recent study of meeting planners found that one in three have been told by their delegates to only meet in green destinations and one in four said that if all else is equal they will meet in the greenest destination the same study found denver to be one of the top three greenest cities and we want to continue to work on that reputation while expanding everything we can do to be environmentally responsible the carbon calculator gives us an opportunity to work with convention groups and delegates to help them reduce their carbon footprint
5829817 denvers convention greening efforts have been a tremendous capacity building experience for our community all of our efforts have been designed to create a legacy of sustainability we are very proud of the denver metro and convention visitors bureaus launch of the countrys first convention bureau carbon calculators and grateful of the partners who made it happen
5829818 we are delighted to have provided the framework for the denver metro convention amp visitors bureaus online carbon calculators
5829819 there is growing demand from individuals and organizations to demonstrate how they are helping to protect the climate by reducing their carbon dioxide emissions using the carbon calculators travelers and event planners now have convenient tools that help them estimate as accurately as possible their carbon footprint which in turn guides their decisions about how to reduce or neutralize their emissions

5829836 given what we know about the dangers of these emissions this settlement did not come a moment too soon for the people who live and work near this facility for this community and indeed for all new jerseyans it means healthier air a better quality of life and the peace of mind that comes with knowing this facility will be cleaning up its act

5829847 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5829848 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5829849 each blog post can become a discussion through comments left by readers blogs make the news a two way street

5829853 my best advice would be to blog about what you want
5829854 i encourage my students to tell their friends about the blog ive talked about it at conferences within the context of using blogs in the classroom its been fun to see the aids pandemic get mentioned by a few different groups like aids gov but obtaining a large number of subscribers has not been one of my goals
5829855 we issued a press release and we featured links to recent posts prominently on our homepage
5829856 explore the biology of hiv aids its history and review the latest scientific advances related to this pandemic
5829857 students in my course on hiv aids must write and record installments for the blog podcast
5829858 i hoped this assignment would serve two purposes first it would require the students to discuss in a very concise way a scientific topic of interest to them that relates to the pandemic second because of the public nature of the blog podcast i hoped the students would remain engaged with their topic after the assignment was completed i thought friends and family members might listen to the podcast and ask them questions and readers might post comments to which the students could respond
5829859 for me success depends more on the outcomes for my students i measure their satisfaction with the assignment through surveys and i track the number of times that students respond to comments from readers
5829860 as long as the blog or podcast is fulfilling your personal goals it should be considered a success
5829861 we try to create posts on hot news stories related to hiv aids sometimes the posts are commentaries on the news and other times we provide context and clarification on news stories that may have been misleading and in some cases wrong we will encourage one or more people from our staff or board to weigh in with their own take and let the comments come in
5829862 we look at how many sites are linking to ours as one measurement that is particularly interesting to follow
5829863 we have seen a nice increase in the number of sites linking to us over time and i think that is a good indicator that we are content worthy
5829864 when we have hit upon a topic that is generating buzz
5829865 stop coming up with excuses about not having the time or knowing how to do it
5829866 the people especially the young people you used to reach with a hotline number or paper pamphlets and brochures are now online all the time
5829867 we were shown the room where packages were made up to be sent to pows in the various parts of germany important was the fact that these packages were sent under the rubric of fake charity organizations
5829868 put into these special packages under these fake foundations were compasses saws escape maps other items such as pairs of wire cutters
5829869 the baseball would have a radio transmitter inside the cribbage board as you moved the pieces you could listen to the channels of the bbc the deck of playing cards if you steamed the pieces apart in between each card would be a little piece of a silk escape map
5829870 i remember growing up in the 1960s my father loved the tv show hogans heroes
5829871 especially when they were hiding radios in coffee pots and things like that
5829872 they had to use different stationery for these different people and then had to remember so whenever betsy was writing to her boyfriend it had to be betsys handwriting and betsys stationery and you can imagine as the scope of this grew that it had to have rigid control over this or you could you know a lot was at stake
5829873 i found this probably a couple of months before my dad passed away
5829874 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
5829875 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5829876 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5829877 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5829878 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
5829879 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
5829880 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
5829881 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
5829882 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
5829883 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
5829884 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5829885 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5829886 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5829887 i think its going to be fun and it really really feels good to be doing it again
5829888 frank and laurie are great friends one of the things that i thought about it was it was kind of unfinished business we kind of went out with a sigh more than a bang we want to come back and write another chapter
5829889 certainly a fundamental current problem with direct property is indeed assessing value to

5829945 registration is refused because the applied for mark merely describes a feature and characteristic of applicants services
