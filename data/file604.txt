6040000 many of the things we do we think were on the cutting edge
6040001 this is not what the residents or olmsted had in mind in designing this community
6040002 olmsted had a holistic view of communities and the circle of life
6040003 the tapestry of the neighborhoods he created was meant to include not just green spaces but also children young adults adults and dont forget seniors
6040004 my mother in law died at a nursing home here in the neighborhood
6040005 i know personally how important these facilities are to have nearby
6040006 it is hard to say what olmsted would have wanted
6040007 but i feel pretty confident that he probably would have some way for elderly people to be a part of the full community

6040013 for 23 years weve asked solution providers to grade their vendor partners on criteria such as product quality and innovation partner programs and support and each year the results of these grades have created the varbusiness annual report card which reflects the level of commitment vendors have to the channel and to their solution provider partners congratulations to all of the winners
6040014 obviously these companies want doctors to prescribe the medicines theyre marketing
6040015 we want doctors to make their decisions based solely on their best medical judgment rather than the best interests of pharmaceutical manufacturers
6040016 they knew things about my prescribing habits that i didnt know myself
6040017 what we do have are organizations using this as a platform for their own political agendas
6040018 by selling data that allows pharmaceutical sales representatives to see which doctors are prescribing which drugs the ama is giving drug makers what they need to exert more influence
6040019 what weve done has served the public extraordinarily well over the last decade but the reality is that cost has become an issue
6040020 thats changed the paradigm and we are changing with it
6040021 the reason we came about is because of the access to health care issue they are looking for alternatives to access health care
6040022 all providers play a role in the maintenance of the health of a community and individuals
6040023 the key is continuity of the care if an individual chooses to use a retail based health outlet then the responsibility of assuring their health record is complete falls on the individual
6040024 they have been present throughout the country they are obviously responding to a perceived need in the community
6040025 i think anything that improves access for patients is good i have a couple of caveats when patients go to an urgent care center i appreciate getting a record back i think continuity of care is very important communicating back with the primary care doctors is in everyones best interest
6040026 its a very reasonable way to address the needs of patients
6040027 the american academy of pediatrics opposes retail based clinics as an appropriate source of medical care for infants children and adolescents and strongly discourages their use as the aap is committed to the medical home model the medical home model provides accessible family centered comprehensive continuous coordinated compassionate and culturally effective care for which the pediatrician and family share responsibility
6040028 we have plenty of places for people to get care
6040029 i would find a doctor who can provide you with a good medical home
6040030 we specialize in the treatment of children its a whole different level of service youre getting
6040031 we wanted him participating and he wasnt able to fly east so we came to him as it were
6040032 were going to try a lot of things since money is not our problem we may be able to do it at a scale which has never been attempted before
6040033 i have more than enough and i owe this country a great deal
6040034 i love my children and my grandchildren what better thing to do than to try to waken america in particular the youth to this huge problem its after all their future that we are imperiling
6040035 since i am deeply concerned about the future what could be worse than waking up 10 or 15 years from now if im still around and seeing some of these hard landings and worst cases materialize and not having done anything about it
6040036 thats no alternative at all so i decided to put my money where my mouth and my pen have been
6040037 even though it would take a number of years it would help build confidence in the way were managing our economic and fiscal affairs
6040038 and they say i agree pete and dave that they government entitlement programs are unsustainable and its an extremely serious problem
6040039 but the politics are such that they consider it not only politically dangerous to raise some of these tough issues but they consider it i guess you might say politically terminal
6040040 we seem to have become an indulgent entitled myopic society i dont believe that suddenly parents and grandparents have become so selfish and self absorbed that they dont care about their children and their grandchildren
6040041 im the happy and lucky recipient of the american dream
6040042 i seriously wonder whether the american dream would be there for my grandchildren
6040043 we do have hospitals that have above national average on a lot of measures but as a state as a whole we still have areas that are needing improvement
6040044 the time frame of this is frustrating all of the hard work weve been doing isnt going to be reported until far in the future
6040045 we had patients in our pool that shouldnt have been there they had cancer and emphysema and all sorts of things
6040046 all along we felt that our care was appropriate qualitycare
6040047 its important to reflect the actual severity of the patient
6040048 the severity of illness is never as accurate as it should be
6040049 we took this very seriously and we thoroughly analyzed the information
6040050 we reviewed all of the charts and we feel confident that it was not a quality of care concern
6040051 analyzing the data to better understand what is behind the score
6040052 medical center of south arkansas is proud of our performance on core measure indicators and quality initiatives
6040053 overall quality scores are at or above the national average
6040054 as a hospital and as a medical staff we see the indicators that the federal government has are important standards so were treating them as standards to care
6040055 any data can have questions raised about it this data can be considered a little bit old but it still is a way of comparing hospitals around the country

6040063 in academia institutions are becoming more sensitive to intellectual property i deal with this every week when i try to set up research agreements enhancing collaboration is a great idea but it poses some practical implications that are a big hassle to managing research projects
6040064 in medical research we have peer review which is a relatively stringent process this is not the same thing as open source
6040065 when we show our model researchers embrace it its taken a group think approach in a positive way for open source development in the medical field
6040066 a combination of two things is driving the open source movement in the medical field one is a growing interest in research collaboration the other is that a level of software sophistication to enhance medical collaboration is not there yet

6040089 coming from a person occupying the responsible post of a minister in a state the remark is deplorable and should be condemned by all the remark should be withdrawn immediately and the minister should tender an unqualified apology to the people of bihar
6040090 though the ministers unwarranted remark has not not lowered our respect for the state or its people it merits to be denounced and an apology from naik would be in place biharis are not not beggars but have earned respect and status and done our state proud through sheer merit and hard work

6040101 i think thats where our focus needs to be rather than grabbing additional acres that are basically offshore or in alaska which we cant get to for many years anyway it seems to me that its just a play to put more of these drilling acres in the hands of the oil companies

6040123 we also see particularly interesting applications in terms of the packaging of perishables like meat fish pastry and convenience food
6040124 when the bacteria consume the calcium phosphate thousands of small silver nanometre particles are released it is these tiny silver particles that kill the bacteria and prevent germs from growing and spreading

6040151 the surveys core result is that people care about their communities and express the desire to see government action taken toward local and national issues
6040152 people are hesitant to support efforts concerning global issues even though they believe that environmental quality is poorer at the global level than at the local and national level this is surprising given the media attention that global warming has recently received and reflects the division of opinion about the severity of climate change
6040153 americans are clearly most concerned about pollution issues that might affect their personal health or the health of their families
6040154 more needs to be done to promote the well being and job satisfaction of public workers
6040155 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
6040156 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
6040157 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behaviour

6040160 although smoking is the overwhelming cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd only 20 percent of smokers develop the disease
6040161 our findings suggest that mycoplasma pneumoniae mp infection may be one of the co factors that lead to copd and other diseases among smokers
6040162 without it all smokers would suffer significantly more lung damage
6040163 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form
6040164 this resulted in severe oxidative stress and increased tissue damage as measured by oxidized dna
6040165 the indian technical team has been in nepal for last several days to reinforce and strengthen the spurs and the embankment on the saptkoshi river in consultation with the local administration
6040166 despite repeated requests and pleas by the technical team for urgent local support in view of the gravity of the situation the support from local administration had not been forthcoming as a result the work was frequently delayed
6040167 at the same time the indian technical team was directed to carry out the work on day and night basis
6040168 the indian technical team mobilised required resources and has remained in readiness to carry out the required work to strengthen the embankment but it was prevented from reaching the site
6040169 as a result thousands of people in nepal and india have been forced to suffer a calamity that could have been avoided
6040170 while the indian technical team is ready to undertake protective measures this will become possible only if it receives necessary cooperation from the government of nepal and support from the local people
6040171 i find this boy sachin yardi brilliant he is a very good writer and a director he has narrated this story in such a way that the film provides a wholesome entertainment besides giving a message when the audience will watch this film their time will pass without their realizing it and todays cinema is about entertainment
6040172 the film is about how this prank played creates situations and incidents which are way beyond the control of the three characters tusshar kapoor anupam kher and rajpal yadav in the film i would also say that their journey begins in a house of 600 square feet and it ends up with them being talked about in the parliament and becoming national heros
6040173 i play the love interest of tusshar kapoor in this film and im playing dons mithun chakraborty sister in our relationship im more dominating one im the chatter box and i keep irritating tusshar that he is a looser and he cant do anything so in the process of the film he goes on to prove to me that he is not such a looser
6040174 when i started this campaign everybody called me a young man theyre not calling me that anymore
6040175 im getting gray hair running for president will age you quick

6040177 i dont think hes trying to hide anything hes proud of the few gray hairs he does have when i was coming up we were told it was a sign of wisdom
6040178 its an absolute benefit for him gray hair helps because it makes people look like theyre older and in his case he needs it
6040179 it has nothing to do with stress it has nothing to with anything except your genetic milieu everybody is programmed to get it at some point in life

6040198 its not fair to owen because he really cares for her and ends up getting hurt
6040199 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
6040200 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader

6040209 i was aware it was much more expensive but i was a little deer caught in headlights when we actually moved there
6040210 i wasnt joking when i said well to even enter the real estate market here in flagstaff i would need to be paid twice what i was getting about 100 000
6040211 the key is if we do good architecture beautiful homes that are still affordable you can have something that would be an example demonstration to the community of whats possible
6040212 youd be lucky to get an apartment thats been remodeled and called a townhome
6040213 but im happy with what ive bought but who knows if ill ever be able to move anywhere near flag
6040214 as the very prime places become unaffordable to anybody but the very rich
6040215 people start saying well whats the next prettiest place where do we get the next prettiest view or whats the next prettiest lake that we can afford
6040216 so there is a constant sort of sprawl if you will going on in many of these areas
6040217 when we moved here and had friends come out with us they just thought we were out of our heads
6040218 downtown was largely abandoned and like a lot of these route 66 towns it had been turned over to drunk bars so at 1 oclock at night it was like night of the living dead
6040219 they closed the bars people staggered out there were fights in the streets intoxicated street people everywhere
6040220 i think most americans are kind of groundless because we move all the time were not attached to a place and theres something really compelling about this particular place and its become our home

6040237 liverpool want riera but are reluctant to meet espanyols demands
6040238 an agreement in principle has been reached between om and sunderland for the loan of djibril cisse to the english club until the end of the season
6040239 clubs like liverpool are always looking round the world for players
6040240 there is always going to be someone new challenging you
6040241 it was sudden one day i was a liverpool player the next i was going to leave
6040242 i just wanted to make sure i got the best possible club there was no way i was going to be comfortable playing for another english club and i had plenty of offers from other clubs in the premier league
6040243 i didnt have to leave because i had another year left but i did want to be playing regularly and i didnt feel that would happen this season if i stayed
6040244 i spent seven years at liverpool and played more than 250 games the challenge in italy was the right one for my career and the time was right to change to another country
6040245 of course there are problems between the owners and the manager but hopefully they can resolve those problems and settle down
6040246 keane is a fantastic player and a fantastic signing for the club
6040247 i knew he was a liverpool fan from his childhood and this is the best move of all those he has had in his career he could be the reason liverpool will challenge for a title
6040248 its bad news for holland that they went out but it means we get a player back
6040249 hopefully he can be here either today or tomorrow to train with the rest of his team mates
6040250 he has been playing important games so i dont think there will be any problems with his fitness but our doctor and fitness coaches will check with him and then we will see about the weekend i am sure he will be okay if he trains normally then he can be available for middlesbrough

6040253 how are you going to deal with that when it comes up
6040254 every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
6040255 i think well see consistency becoming crucial towards the end of the season
6040256 that made it really clear to us all how important it is to finish races and pick up good points
6040257 i have aspirations to play for hungary again but i must concentrate on gaining a starting place and performing well for cardiff first
6040258 if i can do that then hopefully i can get back into the international set up
6040259 at the moment ive only read and heard of these things and up till now theres been nothing official
6040260 tomorrow wednesday i should be back in italy so until i find out any other information im a torino player
6040261 i believe in the old fashioned system of signing people whenever a club decided to but if 24 hours can make a difference then great
6040262 it gives you another day working away at what you are trying to do
6040263 we will play the match as a message to the world that georgia is capable of doing so
6040264 more than 2 000 soldiers have been killed plus people in the villages maybe 5 000 in all it is terrible
6040265 but playing this game is sending out a message to the world we are a small country but we can show how big we are
6040266 it is hard for us to play to think about football considering what is happening in georgia
6040267 but maybe things are starting to get better and within a few days the russians will have left
6040268 it is hard for us but we have to play the game
6040269 we cannot allow ourselves to feel that because of what is happening that we are not ready for the game we have to play
6040270 the manager has asked us if we are ready because he needs to know
6040271 but we have all said we will play we want to send a message to russia that we can do this
6040272 we also want to show our people and our supporters who will be in the stadium
6040273 we took shirts off sale at the club shop as soon as we knew about the floors 2 go announcement
6040274 we are already talking to people about the possibility of a new deal but at the moment we dont know what that future is
6040275 we are hoping to hear as soon as possible and when we do we will of course keep the supporters informed
6040276 we were due to launch a new away strip but this has been postponed until we know where we stand with shirt sponsorship
6040277 it is worth spending as much as you can on your computer

6040282 i honestly think i faced a lot more dangerous a chris eubank than the eubank who fought dan sherry or ray close
6040283 why because eubank wasnt motivated eubank was dangerous when he fought watson and dangerous when he fought benn
6040284 when he was the underdog when his back was against the wall he was a different animal
6040285 when i fought him that time people talk about him having problems making super middleweight but ive lost 14 pounds in a week to make the weight
6040286 weve all done that he was a dangerous fighter he gave me one hell of a fight but people didnt give me the credit they gave him the credit for coming back
6040287 that was my first 12 round fight id done eight rounds twice and knocked everyone else out inside three so on that aspect i dont think much would have been different if id fought eubank at his peak
6040288 dont forget im a lot better fighter now when i fought eubank
6040289 if i fought benn obviously he was a dangerous puncher but i think hed have had a nightmare with my style
6040290 it would have been a difficult fight but id have beat him id have beat them all
6040291 hed probably have been the most awkward of all of them
6040292 at the end of the day when push came to shove he lost and thats the difference between a great champion to have your back against the wall and find a way to win
6040293 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will be confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre

6040312 i found the stunt a lot more exhausting and physical than i expected it to be
6040313 i was wearing three weight belts to keep me on the sea bed and i had to keep equalising yet try and look graceful
6040314 my dress kept floating up over my head my hair kept getting in my mouth and my eyes went red in the water being underwater was emotionally really liberating though
6040315 the only scary bit was when i thought the diving instructor was to the left of me but he was to the right i swam around looking for him but by the time i got to him i had no air left it was a bit freaky
6040316 when i got outside i looked like a giant prune
6040317 i had a boob job there it is i finally said it i wanted to come clean that i had my boobs done in my 20s because people falsely write that ive had all those things done
6040318 ive had the two procedures that probably every other woman in hollywood has had done
6040319 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
6040320 i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated
6040321 i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me
6040322 im so excited its my dream age i dont know why but literally since my 12th birthday ive wanted to turn 30 i feel like theres nothing more graceful or elegant than the beauty of a female when she has figured out who she is and thats what happens for women in their 30s
6040323 im so ready to not be insecure and not ask so many questions to not put so much pressure on myself but to just actually be
6040324 i cried all day when i turned 30 i couldnt have a party

6040350 weve definitely been excited about the growth and embrace of technology by both voters and candidates
6040351 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics
6040352 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
6040353 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
6040354 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
6040355 as idealistic as that sounds is as idealistic as we are it is exciting all around not just for google
6040356 this new politics is disruptive upsetting old arrangements and displacing people invested in the old ways
6040357 it is literally crashing the gate of the old system
6040358 my gold medal hope has just gone down the tube
6040359 perhaps a more effective and simple approach is to ensure the identity of those accessing business critical applications sensitive information or working with data on the move
6040360 strays are normally only taken to kennels the second time they are picked up or on any subsequent occasion
6040361 however well be taking a tougher stance in the hope of highlighting how seriously we take the problem of owners allowing their pets out unaccompanied
6040362 during the past two years we have picked up almost 1 000 strays
6040363 these animals are a problem because they foul in public places can be responsible for unwanted litters and can also pose a danger to the public
6040364 an agreement in principle has been reached between om and sunderland for the loan of djibril ciss to the english club until the end of the season
6040365 some details still need to be sorted out ahead of the confirmation of the loan
6040366 this program would not be appropriate for violent students this is not a program for students who are assaultive or aggressive
6040367 originally it was all about substance abuse so it seems like its a contradiction with the original plan
6040368 we want to be helpful and supportive but i am trying to find out more information about that piece of the program because i have concerns how would the schools know that those kids have that diagnosis is that going to become a policy of tulsa public schools to identify those kids with mental health issues and separate them
6040369 all those are different ways that we come to realize that a student has a mental health issue
6040370 not all will be sent there to new vision it only means those students are eligible to be considered for enrollment in the program
6040371 from my understanding from taylor young we found out where our needs were from those community mental health agencies and this program was designed based on that
6040372 im sure that it will be fine tuned and theres going to be very strong oversight i trust the professionalism of the community mental health groups that made the recommendations to us that we needed to have a program put in place so those kids are not put out of school on home bound services
6040373 allow this to be a wakeup call for hawaii and the rest of the country
6040374 we now have two grieving families who have to grapple with the devastating and destructive effects of mental illness and it is our hope and prayer that no others should have to confront this issue in the painful manner we have had to
6040375 we are concerned that children arent getting services and the families arent getting access the services they need
6040376 oh no is that what i have in front of me
6040377 weve accomplished so many great things but what if this is it before coming here we were at an event in norway and having so much fun but it just suddenly hit me goodness gracious we both want to have families after this and who knows what happens after that
6040378 theres so much going on but i know how fortunate i am i know how crazy my life is and how lucky i am to have this lifestyle and how im living this life thats way beyond my dreams
6040379 going through hell basically living in hell and leaning on my family the opening ceremonies were great in sydney and i have a lot of friends in australia but other than that the experience was not very positive
6040380 that isnt tough to do but it was so cool to see my mom in action and being so aggressive down there she found a lab found a scientist found a lawyer i would have gone home they told me to go home but she found all these people and didnt sleep and she was like a lioness with her cubs she was just fighting for me and it was so stressful without her and my dad there i would not have played
6040381 athens was just a magical trip our venue was gorgeous friends and family were there we played great and won
6040382 but now that were here its like london is a heartbeat away it sounds awesome if its the same qualification process the next time around we love that its a three year process you can spend time with your family work around your schedule so im thinking yes ill be 34 years old in 2012 but
6040383 im able to relax and be with my friends those pretty much are the only people who really know the answer to that question
6040384 i challenge you to help us change public attitudes to help reduce stigma and discrimination you can play an invaluable role in improving the lives of people living with mental illness by becoming a community leader on the stigma issue
6040385 one of the first targets for our anti stigma campaign is health care professionals
6040386 they are far more likely to harm themselves than others
6040387 there must be a conscious decision that mental illnesses are medically important
6040388 theres a huge pressure on beds there are huge demands on the system
6040389 what were seeing is that patients are sicker theyre more acute theyre more medically unstable but theres continuous pressure to get patients admitted treated and out
6040390 if we had more supportive housing for people with long term mental illness it would free up a significant number of the beds that we would say are blocked
6040391 it indicates to me that theres a changing way that hospitalization or stays in a hospital are being used for people with a mental illness
6040392 i was not in the last eight years part of anybodys elite circle
6040393 with school starting next week i would hope that your kids shots should be covered i believe in certain guarantees from your health care policy
6040394 im a huge advocate of offshore drilling right off the coast of north carolina because i think that can revitalize and bring new jobs especially to the eastern part of the state
6040395 if they tell me it is safe it is secure then thats certainly another whole issue that i will be willing to do
6040396 the state chose for decades to permit the prison medical system to rot and decay
6040397 funding for the receiver be tied to unrelated changes in other legislation
6040398 sorry not possible nothing we can do our hands are tied
6040399 we went in the house and took pictures and there were no holes in the wall at all
6040400 because she was in the doorway without the gun in her hand and because they believed the taser had some effect on her the decision was made to enter the apartment
6040401 it seems that they tried to do everything they could do

6040434 this marks a tremendous step forward to ensure all americans can fully participate in this years historic democratic national convention and in our democratic process
6040435 we applaud what sirius is doing to bring listeners across the country in to the convention experience and in particular its efforts to offer a bilingual simulcast for the more than 35 million americans who speak spanish
6040436 we look forward to welcoming to st paul sirius and the hundreds of other media outlets that will help bring the 2008 republican national convention into millions of homes across america and around the world it will be an historic event as sen john mccain accepts our partys nomination and springboards into the general election
6040437 sirius will cover the democratic and republican national conventions like radio has never done before with hosts from many perspectives and dedicated channels in both english and spanish we will use our technology and extensive programming to give listeners unprecedented coverage of these historic events
6040438 patriotism in my view does not mean unquestioning acceptance of whatever the government does to go along with whatever your government does is not a characteristic of democracy i remember in my own early education we were taught that it was a sign of a totalitarian state of a dictatorship when people did not question what their government did if you live in a democratic state it means you have the right to criticize your governments policies
6040439 im sick and tired of getting the same old thing

6040455 can we decrease the morbidity and mortality from lemierres syndrome
6040456 as a representative of the data model the data source supplies no information about the table views appearance including the cells that compose the table the table view objects delegate an object adopting the uitableviewdelegate protocol provides that information
6040457 warning class myclass does not fully implement the uitableviewdatasource protocol
6040458 yeah the house was passed on to them after their father died
6040459 house is paid for and an older brother pays the taxes on it and randy ralph and their friends live in it all they do is drink they dont eat and they have no running water or electricity they pretty much collect stuff to recycle so they can buy more booze sometimes they get desperate and drink rubbing alcohol this kind of stuff
6040460 its caught the heart of australians and at the moment the public is really really desperately wanting something to save the whale
6040461 it is possible it might not be probable but its possible that it could be picked up and adopted
6040462 as the calf is still being breast fed we have no way of feeding or socializing it
6040463 so taking this humpback into captivity is not an option
6040464 unless it can go out to open water and find a mother i dont really know whats going to happen
6040465 hey look im starting a brand new membership site for this certain group of professionals go here right now to be on the pre release list
6040466 im building this membership site right now and im looking for answers from you email me back with the things that youd like to know that youd like me to develop the content youd like to be developed
6040467 many people who would never throw for instance a plastic bag on the ground would go ahead and toss a cigarette butt on the ground and step on it and leave it there
6040468 because theres no nutritional value when an animal eats a cigarette butt or several cigarette butts they feel full and can actually starve to death
6040469 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
6040470 the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
6040471 robotics shaped by and shaping the world in 2000 2050
6040472 dont worry bride you children will not be born puppies
6040473 most of the fires are small less than half an acre
6040474 if our initial attack efforts are successful we will prevent fires from becoming large fires
6040475 in the long run our initial attack success minimizes the likelihood of large fires and significantly reduces the costs of firefighting on the forest
6040476 once we get a better picture of how many fires and how large they are we will prioritize our efforts and order additional firefighting resources as we need them
6040477 we brief our guys on what to expect so if it gets really bad they know how to react to it if it doesnt get really bad than its an easier day for us
6040478 its very difficult to learn to use an interpreter so its good practice for myself and my lieutenants
6040479 running under vista or any other windows os quite easily
6040480 we all had some bad news today our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
6040481 ive been a big fan of films since i was a little girl and love the festival i always thought that id love to have a little piece of the screen which is full of emotions from the films
6040482 when i saw it for the first time i thought what is this its full of holes
6040483 i couldnt risk sending the screen abroad to do the bag so i was looking for a good well known firm in switzerland every bag is hand made in switzerland and im very proud of this
6040484 i was very proud when they told me it was a big idea for them
6040485 its great when i see somebody with one of my bags because i think wow theres somebody with a special bag which has all these emotions from the film festival
6040486 the future of mega will be to do special products bags but also accessories with other products which contain emotions from the whole world
6040487 you also have to believe in yourself and your ideas
6040488 we expected and intended to have no impact whatsoever on the direction of prices
6040489 they are just too awesome everyone talks about them and my bank account has too much money my country wins too many gold medals i fart unicorns
6040490 this is particularly significant given the multitude of challenges facing the government of iraq today
6040491 it is a strong political signal for nuclear disarmament and non proliferation my hope is that it will encourage other countries of the region and beyond to follow suit
6040492 with the background of the nuclear ambitions iraq entertained in the late 1980s and early 1990s joining the family of ctbt member states is an important political step
6040493 these keynotes are an exceptional opportunity for search marketers to understand where our industry is headed tim is a google veteran who helped build google into the advertising powerhouse it is today plus hes fought the battles to help search advertising gain acceptance bill as a self avowed data geek is always entertaining when he shares what we can learn about ourselves from how we search were fortunate and pleased to have both participating
6040494 the latest round of results means big cap information technology companies are going to make it through the rest of the year
6040495 theyre going to obviously see some impact from the rising dollar this is going to influence their overseas revenue and will have some impact on their bottom line
6040496 this pushes out the wall of worry for tech investors until another 90 days
6040497 it looks like results are going to be close to normal for these two groups
6040498 it is not to say nobody is concerned about these things there is tremendous concern
6040499 we never went out during the time we were training
6040500 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a
6040501 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
6040502 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month
6040503 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
6040504 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
6040505 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
6040506 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
6040507 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6040508 hoje ontem por volta das 18h o m dico o liberou por avaliar que ele j estava em condi es de enfrentar essa situa o
6040509 deposit pricing pressure has intensified while asset margin expansion has been muted as banks are all chasing the same low risk borrowers
6040510 our concern is that the second quarter margin uptick could prove ephemeral
6040511 we havent seen anything like this before where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival
6040512 there was a question mark last year about apple that maybe it had taken its eye off the ball by concentrating on the iphone but now the iphone and ipod and mac are nicely aligned
6040513 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista
6040514 complaints about vista are generating complaints about the computer makers
6040515 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
6040516 most lose it slowly like dell has which took a while and we see companies improve but apples extreme volatility is almost like its stock price
6040517 apple will be very difficult to catch but i dont think that these results where theres a ten point difference will hold
6040518 my guess is that they will regroup at some point and come back
6040519 deposit pricing pressure has intensified while asset margin expansion has been muted as banks are all chasing the same low risk borrowers
6040520 our concern is that the second quarter margin uptick could prove ephemeral
6040521 durant la p riode de transition faisant suite la finalisation des rectifications comptables
6040522 nous voyons une excellente croissance linternational et sur les march s mergents en particulier
6040523 our universe actually is the only thing it could possibly be the internal structure of nothingness
6040524 the only stat we care about is at the end of the game what it says on the scoreboard
6040525 our thing is making sure the guys work hard and understand the schemes
6040526 when you do something for 10 years and you know it works youre not changing it
6040527 he brings an incredible understanding of this game and this offense hes just an unbelievable motivational coach
6040528 i was the starting center for coach cuts first game at ole miss
6040529 its awesome to come to work every day with guys who you believe in and trust
6040530 we know each other and we know each others families we know when we all come to work and all about our likes and our dislikes that makes a difference when we recruit kids come in and see the family atmosphere
6040531 were all in there together watching film and designing plays and bouncing ideas off one another we like to say that all of us are smarter than any one of us
6040532 we have to be just be an absolute machine on attention to detail
6040533 offensive line play is one of the greatest thing to coach i think its one of the prettiest things to look at in football for a lineman nothing happens until that center puts his hand on the ball but when an offensive line is fundamentally sound step in unison and do the little things
6040534 thats why i love matt coaching there matts been around me a long time matt knows how i feel about the fundamentals of it were going to do what they do well were not going to line up and just dominate anybody athletically right now but we have some athleticism and were going to use that athleticism to our advantage
6040535 if they can do that and get bigger thats better shoot youd like to have them big lean and fast but you want to maximize what you have if you do have a 6 8 300 pound fred roland maximize what he has if you have a 6 3 250 pound bryan morgan you want to maximize his talents
6040536 theyve asked me to gain some weight not bad weight
6040537 right now im at 250 pounds and im trying to sustain it
6040538 hes doing a good job getting people in the right spots he might get in zone tough spots due to his size but he can handle it going up against vince oghobaase every day in practice helps him
6040539 were doing some high paced offensive stuff so when coach cutcliffe came in here he wanted us to lose some weight we listened to him and a bunch of us lost some weight if feels good
6040540 were hitting our landmarks better i think we dont fatigue as much in a ballgame one of the things we saw in watching all the games from a year ago particularly the early hot games i thought that our guys melted a bunch as the game went on they lost the fundamentals lost soundness lost technique lost effort so far i think were better in that regard
6040541 the thing is as the extra weight came off i improved in the weight room with coach durfey
6040542 so i still have plenty of strength thats not the issue i think its more the opposite its not that im losing weight its what im gaining from losing weight
6040543 having been in a game and playing in a game is a lot different than doing it in practice you dont truly understand what its like until you have that experience
6040544 weve still got a lot of work to get done a lot to get corrected between now and the first game
6040545 i guess with any new coaching staff comes a different view on how to play the game
6040546 the thing i do like is the urgency coach cut has for us things like getting off the ground quickly and playing with effort all the time i just love that we never accept less than excellence thats one of his sayings
6040547 he says its hard to win so weve got to fight hard
6040548 i think the project is bigger than it needs to be and its not consistent with the neighborhood compromise is what were looking for here
6040549 the lowest floor will be partially buried and the structure will conform with the maximum permitted height
6040550 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for geeves to join the group for the first time
6040551 i have the numbers congress leader ahmed patel has already stated support to us
6040552 i can be cheated but one cannot cheat the people i can walk tall before the people we have taken the decision to withdraw support to the koda government for the people and were appreciated for it
6040553 it is the last alternative and comes only after a party invited by the governor fails to form a government
6040554 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6040555 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6040556 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6040557 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6040558 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6040559 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals
6040560 there is ample reason to suspect that menthol may be harmful to many smokers and disproportionately harmful to black americans
6040561 some experts worry that menthol cigarettes may be one reason why blacks suffer disproportionately from some tobacco related diseases
6040562 found no significant difference in the risk of disease for smokers who use mentholated cigarettes and those who
6040563 the senate should follow the houses lead and give the fda regulatory control over tobacco
6040564 and what should be done to regulate or ban it
6040565 with millions of americans currently smoking menthol cigarettes the question needs to be answered quickly
6040566 given the fragility of african agriculture and perpetual famine risks with millions of lives at stake msv is actually one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide
6040567 we wanted to learn more about how the virus emerged and spread so we can develop new ways to fight the diseases it causes
6040568 we found that the maize adapted virus infects a greater variety of grasses than any of the other msv strains
6040569 the virus appears to be spreading around africa faster than the other strains too when we compared the genomes of 11 different strains of msv we discovered that lots of genes had been exchanged between the strains in a process called recombination we also found that every msv that causes severe disease in maize has descended from an ancestral virus that was the recombinant offspring of two relatively harmless wild grass infecting viruses this chance recombination event could be the reason msv has become such a serious problem
6040570 understanding the chain of events that trigger the emergence of novel pathogens is a major goal of epidemiologists worldwide
6040571 there is a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting how evolutionary processes like recombination might trigger the emergence of a pathogen but there are actually very few well documented examples of this having occurred
6040572 knowing that maize adapted msvs are unusually mobile i hope will prompt scientists to test msv resistance genes against the large bank of virus strains that we have catalogued from across africa
6040573 we are currently testing various resistance strategies some in an advanced stage of development using many of the viruses weve sampled complex genetic strategies like stacking resistance genes and targeting different virus components that cannot be simultaneously exchanged by recombination might ultimately be the only way to control the disease
6040574 this bulletin paints a picture of wide discrepancy between the number of men who take are treated or even die from drug use compared to the number of women
6040575 the fact more than 1 500 people died due to drug use in 2007 is extremely saddening in itself but the fact so many of these deaths are male raises many questions about gender and drug misuse
6040576 new generation fastsuits may be a technological advantage for swimmers who wear them
6040577 this is similar conceptually to how engineers design cars for racing and how we can employ physics to compliment human performance i think we all are eager to see how the swimmers in will utilize these suits to showcase their prowess and years of hard work and training
6040578 in den letzten zwei rennen haben wir nur acht punkte geholt eindeutig nicht genug
6040579 mit diesem trend sind wir jetzt wieder dort wo wir 2007 waren und das entspricht nicht unserer zielsetzung
6040580 mein vierter platz in der startaufstellung beweist dass das auto nicht so schlecht f r die strecke gewesen sein kann die bedingungen waren am samstag und sonntag hnlich ich w rde daher meinen dass die ursache f r das schlechte abschneiden bei den reifen zu suchen ist
6040581 that was the worst sinus attack i have ever had
6040582 his outstanding contribution and scientific discoveries in the field of novel drug target research in helminth parasites
6040583 there are some exciting developments in the field of microscopy which could have a huge impact in public health including the development of three dimensional ultrastructural imaging which will help interpret more accurately processes taking place inside the cell
6040584 the symposium provides an excellent forum for young researchers to present their data at a conference and were delighted its being held at queens
6040585 die bisherige saison kommt mir ganz anders vor als die vor einem jahr damals spielte konstanz eine gro e rolle diesmal erzielten die topfahrer ganz unterschiedliche ergebnisse jeder fahrer der mindestens ein rennen gewann holte mindestens zweimal keine punkte
6040586 am wichtigsten wird es sein immer in die punkte zu fahren
6040587 gute ergebnisse sind deshalb umso wichtiger und bis zum ende der saison wird auch die konstanz wichtiger werden am wichtigsten wird es sein immer in die punkte zu fahren
6040588 von nun an wird jedes einzelne rennen extrem wichtig sein und jeder einzelne punkt einen gro en wert haben
6040589 diese saison zeigt wieder dass man nie aufgeben sollte ich hatte ein paar rennen in denen es nicht so gut lief aber aus irgendeinem grund war ich immer noch in der lage ein paar punkte zu sammeln wir m ssen aber konstant gute ergebnisse erzielen
6040590 nach dem letzten rennen muss ich einen punkt mehr haben als die anderen das ist mein ziel
6040591 ich freue mich immer sehr wenn eine neue rennstrecke im kalender auftaucht und auf valencia bin ich besonders gespannt
6040592 mir steht von ungarn immer noch ein l cheln im gesicht das war ein unglaubliches resultat ein fantastisches gef hl und ich hoffe es war der erste von vielen podiumspl tzen in der formel 1 f r mich
6040593 aber valencia ist ein neues rennen und alles beginnt wieder neu
6040594 the building is under renovation however we had no other place to go there is no electricity here no potable water no food we have no beds to sleep on most of us are in despair we are really lost
6040595 we need to resume normal childhood activities for children and to ensure that protection mechanisms and health standards are in place for them
6040596 were asking v festival visitors to join the 15 6 million other superheroes who have already joined the odr and to discuss their wishes with their families
6040597 more than 7 800 people in the uk are currently waiting for an organ transplant and the sad fact is that over 1 000 of them will die while waiting due to an acute shortage of donors
6040598 young people are fantastic supporters of organ donation 30 of people on the register were aged between 16 and 25 when they joined
6040599 we are hoping that lots of festival goers will visit the uk transplant stand have a go at being a superhero and sign up to the nhs organ donor register and pledge to give the gift of life
6040600 taking the superhero theme of the campaign the game gives users the opportunity to upload their picture to make themselves a superhero and pass the results onto friends and family
6040601 it is designed to be fun with a serious message that we hope people will pass on everyone can be a superhero and save a life by joining the nhs organ donor register superhero me means they can also make themselves look like one
6040602 the sharp drop in commodity prices since mid july seems to have been priced in now in the best case the market is moving sideways with a negative touch
6040603 the banking system needs to continue rationalisation and we will see some mergers under pressure as theres not enough business around for the banks
6040604 ik heb hier veel voor opgeofferd en drie jaar keihard getraind deze ploeg kan alles aan
6040605 dit was onze beste wedstrijd van het toernooi alles klopte
6040606 de winst op itali heeft de ploeg zoveel energie gegeven daarnaast was het geweldig te zien hoe goed iedereen zich aan zijn primaire taken hield dat is het resultaat van mentale training focussen op wat je precies moet doen dat hebben de meiden tegen hongarije precies uitgevoerd we bleven goed spelen de hele wedstrijd het lijkt er op dat de ploeg zich in een flow bevindt
6040607 deze dertien meiden worden door elf mensen begeleid we hebben aan alles gedacht geen punt is aan onze aandacht ontsnapt
6040608 when people are reminded of their death thats a fundamental threat to them and it challenges their self esteem so people try to uphold their self esteem and one way of doing that is to defend their culture
6040609 everybody preferred the products from their own culture though this difference or preference was more pronounced among participants who had thoughts about their own death
6040610 he claimed to have tinnitus in his ears and declined to board the flight to london
6040611 he is banned from entering because he was jailed and he could pose a threat to domestic morality
6040612 wenn sang und klang sich mit hingabe mischen entstehen w rme kraft und liebevolle verbindung mantren aus aller welt alt und doch frisch wie klares quellwasser wirken heilsam auf k rper geist und seele ohne anstrengung und rezept
6040613 this educational failure is the foundation of poverty in wales and relegates a significant proportion of the population to labour market failure and consequent patterns of low income unemployment and benefit dependency
6040614 nicht ich bin es den du suchst ich bin nur die dienerin das h chsten von uns des k nigs ich werde dich nun durch sein reich f hren und am ende wirst auch du ihn lobpreisen
6040615 ich sehe dein unverst ndnis doch h re meine worte dies ist
6040616 auf mir lastet ein fluch jahre habe ich gek mpft in den finstersten landen im ganzen reich habe ich mich in die tiefsten tiefen der bierzelte k chenm rkte und sch tzenfeste gewagt um meine weisen ans volk zu bringen doch die zeit hat an mir genagt mein freund und wo ich einst der unangefochtene feldherrscher war treten j ngere an mich herauszufordern ich bin des klampfes m de und leid mein gesicht ist nurmehr eine maske die ich auftrage um meine verbitterung zu kaschieren leider verlor ich die kontrolle ber diese maske schon vor langer langer zeit
6040617 gr met euch nicht meine lieben gr met euch nicht nie habe ich meine eigentliche macht verloren die macht die menschen mit meinen weisen gl cklich zu machen und auch ihr sollt wieder jauchzen und frohlocken cest verde
6040618 eles removeram v rios dos requerimentos b sicos dos jogos da xbla por m ainda existem muitos
6040619 even though the toll is so high you should be proud of what you are doing the work that youre doing here is indispensable
6040620 were going to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6040621 with no threat of losing clientele to competitors many schools and school districts behave like the monopolies they are
6040622 these school districts focus on strengthening the organizations position and goals rather than meeting the needs of students and parents
6040623 its barbaric unnecessary its gratuitous cruelty and i dont believe most canadians would want to be associated with this type of redneck event
6040624 its easier to make a mistake when youre trying to sever the animals head if youre partying and drinking
6040625 if the animals head isnt severed its possible that they could be experiencing extreme pain and suffering
6040626 i would encourage these people to give vegetarian options a try
6040627 we are against the act of organizing something that amuses people over the death of an animal
6040628 the chicken killings take about 10 or 15 minutes out of the whole day
6040629 we kill them ourselves and we cook them on the barbecue everything is eaten that night
6040630 they didnt believe me so they tried it and thats how it started
6040631 the hen doesnt suffer we cut off the head in one shot
6040632 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6040633 the repugnant aspect is his attack on the morality and ethics of human beings who are trying to work with a very difficult population
6040634 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6040635 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6040636 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6040637 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6040638 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6040639 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6040640 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6040641 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6040642 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6040643 the liberal dark decade is over the conservative government is getting tough on drug crime so that hard working canadians and their families dont have to pay the price for this despicable trade
6040644 i broke every law on the planet to get more dope
6040645 what got me clean was a hammer over my head
6040646 no member of the staff said any such thing to the judge or to his counsel or to anyone else representing the judge
6040647 she the judge left the case open and ordered the kids returned on a trial basis and ordered a c s administration for childrens services to do intensive supervision
6040648 she did it with the consent of the law guardian he objected to a final order and the judge never issued a final order
6040649 from his demeanor on the stand the manner in which he gave testimony his evasiveness and the inconsistencies in his testimony the court finds the respondent not to be a credible witness
6040650 the detectives are trying to determine if this guy had anything to do with the shooting
6040651 they are also trying to determine if the shooting was a mistake if it was pulled off by someone who targeted the wrong house
6040652 and then played the most beautiful version of somewhere over the rainbow i ever heard and thats the night i fell in love with le roi moore and i still love him today
6040653 many people who would never throw for instance a plastic bag on the ground would go ahead and toss a cigarette butt on the ground and step on it and leave it there
6040654 because theres no nutritional value when an animal eats a cigarette butt or several cigarette butts they feel full and can actually starve to death
6040655 luoghi di ritrovo giovanili dove diffuso luso di sostanze alcoliche e psicotrope

6040657 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
6040658 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
6040659 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
6040660 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
6040661 for the most part what we have been getting is natural parasites and fin erosion which are normal in sand bed rivers
6040662 throughout the 12 years there has been no significant impact shown from oilsands development
6040663 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
6040664 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved
6040665 some of the community concern was that even if they were bringing them in fish for testing i dont think ramp was doing a great job in communicating back to those individuals about the testing
6040666 there will be an impasse a kind of stalemate which were heading towards
6040667 things have been bad before one keeps wondering how much lower they can go
6040668 quietly they are rather irritated this has happened in the first place
6040669 they will continue to come out in support of georgia but dont forget that american power in this region is limited russian power in this region is far easier to exert
6040670 the extent of eu unity is in direct proportion to the extent that russia becomes aggressive and assertive
6040671 wir wollen die gr te und beliebteste shoppingwebsite sein und bleiben dazu m ssen wir uns auf neue marktherausforderungen und ver nderte anspr che unserer k ufer und verk ufer einstellen und vor allem die k uferzufriedenheit auf ebay weiter verbessern
6040672 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6040673 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate
6040674 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
6040675 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
6040676 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6040677 i use guarded language because while the potential to manipulate exists i dont think its a major problem
6040678 we must do the best and let god do the rest

6040680 the results show that it is feasible to differentiate and mature human embryonic stem cells into functional oxygen carrying erythrocytes red blood cells on a large scale
6040681 theyve grown these in the test tubes and been able to get them to mature so that many aspects of these cells look like red blood cells that you make and i make
6040682 but they havent given them to people and see if they survive
6040683 biological properties and enucleation of red blood cells from human embryonic stem cells
6040684 vap is a relatively common infection and increasingly one caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria
6040685 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
6040686 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology
6040687 the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body

6040689 as tropical storm fay headed to landfall americas second harvest began readying supplies typically associated with the initial stage of disaster relief such as heater meals bottles of water and hand held snacks to provide basic assistance until the full effects of the storm can be assessed by local officials
6040690 these items are needed when there is no access to power or water in homes as the recovery process begins we will continue to help feed those affected by the storm
6040691 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes
6040692 while prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal these findings add to the existing concerns about the long term health consequences of low and moderate exposure to inorganic arsenic
6040693 arsenic exposure and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in us adults
6040694 it is difficult for small business owners to deal with not only losing an employee when he is called to service but also because it can be burdensome to continue to pay an absent employee
6040695 because of the extensive education and clinical training required to become a physical therapist students often begin their careers with significant levels of debt
6040696 relieving some of that financial burden and bringing more physical therapists to clinically underserved communities will provide lasting benefits for years to come
6040697 and in lane 4 we have suns javafx used by web properties such as well its still in development
6040698 this isnt the type of market where only one technology is going to win
6040699 i think sun has the opportunity to catch up very quickly in that space
6040700 i would say that the javafx platform looks very good it has a lot of potential
6040701 it probably should have been announced three four five years ago
6040702 technically javafx enables me to leverage the java skill set and java technology that i am more comfortable with to deliver a compelling ria solution because synergy between javafx and java is excellent and the fact that javafx is built on the java platform means that i can ensure that i have one of the best and supportive platforms to work in in addition javafx will enable me to be more productive in making it easier and quicker to create ria solutions
6040703 a powerful client technology for creating rich internet applications with immersive media and content across the multiple screens of your life
6040704 javafx script the language of javafx doesnt replace swing the core java gui toolkit but provides an alternative way of programming that hopefully will bring java technology to the masses
6040705 javafx takes that momentum and the advantages we have with java but makes it much easier to create rich interactive and immersive experiences
6040706 it matches the way they think about interfaces in their head and is very intuitive
6040707 the update provides a much faster loading process for the applets
6040708 the platform promises a lot of new apis and new abstractions to make the harder things simpler and the simpler things very easy
6040709 americas future depends on the health of our country the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs our analysis shows that were not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
6040710 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority
6040711 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
6040712 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
6040713 the report shows the serious impact that the obesity crisis is having on our countrys health and economic well being
6040714 we need to continue to work to create a real push towards reversing the obesity epidemic it is time we make it a national priority
6040715 these types of ongoing projects made possible only through collaborations with our clinical partners are critical to determining the molecular signatures of this extremely complicated disease the efforts of our clinical partners to carefully collect these biological samples as well as the relevant clinical information from each patient is central for the success of this project
6040716 were pleased to be part of this project that gives our patients an opportunity to participate in very significant research by collaborating with als tdi a broad spectrum of people living with als are now involved in the creation of therapeutics
6040717 as a physician to sufferers of critical limb ischemia i am extremely proud to be involved in developing therapeutic applications using the erc cell if approved by the fda we may one day provide this patient population with an option to amputation
6040718 since the normal function of the erc in a womans body is to generate new blood vessels on a monthly basis it is logical that these cells would generate new blood vessels in limbs that suffer from poor circulation and our current studies support this
6040719 given that dr murphy has experience with therapeutic applications for stem cells in critical limb ischemia we are honored to have him lead these studies which will be a key component in an upcoming submission to the fda

6040726 brachytherapy may be the preferable treatment for obese men with early stage prostate cancer
6040727 being overweight does not present any unique technical challenges for brachytherapy as it does for surgery and external beam
6040728 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
6040729 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
6040730 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
6040731 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
6040732 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions
6040733 i believe that this novel signaling behavior could indicate the owls current reproductive status to potential intruders such as other territorial owls or non breeding floaters
6040734 such marking behavior may have been overlooked in birds and i hope that our story will represent the beginning of new and stimulating explorations on other questions and mechanisms in territoriality and social communication
6040735 faeces may represent an ideal substance for marking because it has a minimal energetic cost to the signaler and can continue to indicate possession of a territory when the owner is occupied in activities other than territorial defense
6040736 to obtain stronger evidence on the intriguing idea that eagle owls use faeces and prey feathers to signal current reproduction
6040737 we will need to perform further experimental studies and behavioral observations that examine whether faeces and feathers provoke specific behavioral reactions and what functional significance these behavioral reactions have
6040738 owls responded so rapidly to the removal of their faecal marks that during the night after the spraying that they came back to defecate not only on the same posts but precisely on the painted stretches

6040740 when you look across the planet things are different depending on where youre talking about
6040741 we didnt see much of a change in the third quarter from the second quarter
6040742 this time the company got a little help from the weak dollar
6040743 the company had strong tailwinds in europe and the asia pacific region
6040744 impressive in light of concerns that a stronger u s dollar would be negative for its international business
6040745 the company remains well positioned long term given they its leadership in pc notebooks and emerging markets
6040746 its a different field if you will but its no less important
6040747 its a privilege to represent this state particularly we have a great tradition here ted kennedy and going back to john quincy adams
6040748 twelve billion dollars a month a month are being spent in place where there was no al qaida and there were no weapons of mass destruction and the place where there is they have ignored sufficiently that its now at great risk
6040749 im smart enough to know that in this new way that congress works you very rarely get the slot where you can bring a bill that has your own name on it to the floor
6040750 usually youre trying to attach something to something else to get it passed
6040751 bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
6040752 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
6040753 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
6040754 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news and went looking for producer albert r broccoli to tell him
6040755 so spielberg went off and made indiana jones who i reckon to be a period james bond
6040756 our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave up his ghost to heaven we will miss him always
6040757 now hes really a famous con man he was a con man known in bigfoot circles for years and now it wont be long before everybody knows it
6040758 i think her snowscapes are her best because they arent as dark and depressing as some of her works
6040759 this is a large work with a beautiful symmetry and rhythm
6040760 cech is at chelsea one of the best teams in the world and i think he has the ability to be the best goalkeeper in the world
6040761 matty derbyshire got a good run of goals when he went to wrexham and kicked on from there i am sure jamie has seen that and theres no reason why he cant do the same
6040762 he has settled in well with the lads here and has the confidence to express himself and once he gets that first goal im sure that will set him off
6040763 a transfer is complicated because it requires three criteria to be fulfilled theres the player his current club and the buying club
6040764 since may joaquin has been in a very complicated situation
6040765 in recent months i have spoken to up to four different sporting directors one day they tell me a the next week its b and then c the player has got dizzy
6040766 thats why i have come to valencia to speak again with the club
6040767 kempy has watched him out in russia this summer and likes what he sees
6040768 his judgement of a player is spot on so i have no problem trusting his opinion
6040769 clubs like liverpool are always looking round the world for players and there is always going to be someone new challenging you
6040770 it was sudden one day i was a liverpool player the next i was going to leave
6040771 i just wanted to make sure i got the best possible club there was no way i was going to be comfortable playing for another english club and i had plenty of offers from other clubs in the premier league
6040772 i didnt have to leave because i had another year left but i did want to be playing regularly and i didnt feel that would happen this season if i stayed
6040773 when you are playing in non league the top flight is a long way away and you are looking up in awe at times but sometimes you end a game thinking you are good but not as good as i thought you were
6040774 i have proved it at club level international level and now i aim to do that at premier league level
6040775 there has been people who feel i couldnt do it
6040776 i found it easy to move to the north east
6040777 i was reluctant at one point but you have to be a man and make hard decisions and its been the best decision i have made looking back now i would not have changed it for the world
6040778 theres been lots of speculation every day and weve been linked with hundreds of players and i dont think well be signing all of them
6040779 ive no comment to make on speculation if we sign any decent players well release a statement but theres no point me talking about players who might or might not be coming to the football club
6040780 weve made good progress over the last day or two and i hope we have some news over the next 48 hours
6040781 this is an ambitious and completely unique feature that has never been attempted before for football videogames
6040782 accurate and in depth player and team data each week

6040791 they had 30 people working around the clock and they force fed the whale with a massive tube not only do we not have the facilities to do that in nsw but the success rate of that method is only 2 to 3 per cent and it has never been tried on a humpback whale
6040792 it is likely only to distress or endanger the whale and to endanger those trying to carry out the feeding process

6040797 electronics manufacturers continue to explore new materials that offer higher performance at lower costs across a wide spectrum of applications
6040798 we have proven that our cvd diamond is an ideal material to address thermal management issues in particular while being extremely cost effective to implement given that diamonds benefits have been demonstrated we are now at a juncture as an organization that speaks to increasing our sales outreach apa is an ideal partner for us thanks to their background and industry knowledge and we have tasked them with actively marketing our products and increasing their adoption in electronics manufacturing
6040799 apa very quickly recognized the unique value proposition that sp3 offers the electronics industry in terms of manufacturing cvd diamond and offering a broad cvd diamond product portfolio targeting thermal management applications
6040800 we expect that sp3s diatherm heat spreaders and cvd diamond wafer coating services with the significant performance improvements they deliver will be of great interest to the electronics manufacturing and packaging markets
6040801 what is more important is to find means by which we can redistribute our economic gains to the benefit of all
6040802 there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
6040803 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
6040804 certainly there is no limit to taxation if the benefits derived from public services by society measure up to the cost in taxation which they have to pay
6040805 it is a fallacy to say that there is this limit and it is a fallacy to rely mainly on individual free enterprise to get the savings
6040806 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
6040807 we can only compete if our government makes the investments that give us a fighting chance
6040808 and if we know that our families have some net beneath which they cannot fall
6040809 if left to the individual consolidation will take a long time to come we have to look at priorities in terms of what is good for society and on this basis we may find it necessary to force people to do things they would not do otherwise
6040810 the government should restrict the size of farms that can be owned by one individual throughout the country
6040811 one who has read marx cannot fail to see that corporations are not only what marx referred to as the advanced stage of capitalism
6040812 but marx even called it finance capitalism by which a few would control the finances of so many and through this have not only economic power but political power as well
6040813 we hold them up as role models and our mythology is steeped in stories of men on the make
6040814 the problems of poverty and racism the uninsured and the unemployed are rooted in the desire among those at the top of the social ladder to maintain their wealth and status whatever the cost

6040833 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
6040834 they didnt compensate for the lower calorie mushroom meal by eating more food later in the day
6040835 we found that overtly substituting ground white button mushrooms for lean ground beef in a single meal for four consecutive days significantly reduced daily energy and fat intake while maintaining ratings of palatability appetite satiation and satiety
6040836 the method of substituting one food for another within familiar recipes may be more appealing to many prospective dieters than making more dramatic or restrictive changes in dietary behaviour
6040837 essential for assessing potential utility of a food substitution since palatability is known to exert a strong influence on
6040838 in addition the fat content of a food tends to increase palatability for us populations which is one reason that overconsumption of high fat foods is thought to occur
6040839 this example of how energy and fat content in the diet may be decreased while maintaining palatability may be useful for the development of generalizable strategies for weight management

6040858 there have been lots of positive changes in terms of perceptions about the importance of professionalism and training the effort our members have put in to staff in the frontline and the welcome they give to people when they go into a pub its what differentiates a good pub from an ordinary one
6040859 pubs i go into are far more aware of the customer far more aware of the market
6040860 it was going on already but the trading climate has accelerated it people like chris lewis bii licensee of the year have been doing this stuff for 10 years plus there was a business person seeing the opportunity seeing the gap in market and going for it
6040861 0ne thing ive definitely noticed in the last six and a half years has been the pace of legislation being forced on small businesses
6040862 i think there has been the research shows that a minority of people abuse alcohol that minority cause mayhem that minority get reported in the press the fact is we have instant media these days its in the headlines they are looking for adverse stories thats what sells thats what has accelerated it if you look at the success of the industry in terms of test purchasing and underage campaigns it has been dramatic from 50 to 15 failure rate in the space of four years thats a massive achievement that bii and members have been part of what distresses me sometimes is that government has a short memory we came out heavily against the kpmg report condemning its lack of real research and recognition of what weve achieved
6040863 we wont ever solve some of the accusations thrown at us until we reach the point when everyone in a pub who looks under 18 is challenged to show an id card and anyone who is drunk in a pub doesnt get served those are the two key tests thats the standard weve got to aspire to and get to
6040864 i think it will if you travel to the united states no one cares if you get asked for an id card its one of those things thats accepted its a cultural thing we are on the road of doing it
6040865 from the exchequers point of view we generate millions of pounds worth of revenue and the exchequer wants to balance its books its fairly easy to put and extra levy on alcohol duty
6040866 my personal view is if this continues there will be a consumer backlash people will say weve had enough weve had enough of the nannying and telling us what to do theres going to be a line and i think were getting close to that line many mps i know go to pubs and listen to their local electorate that turn around in consumer sentiment is out there its palpable
6040867 as a charity and a not for profit organisation we are here to protect and serve members and the trustees are prepared to do that and make those investments the key thing is to have that bedrock of reserves that weve got both in terms of fixed assets and substantial cash reserves
6040868 we always had competition in the awarding world and cpl arent an awarding body they use edi which is a competitor awarding body in the market
6040869 i dont knock the competition they are out there doing their job and well do ours
6040870 so far weve got seven pub companies through with another four being signed up and coming through assessment we know that certainly at head office level all of those companies have made commitments to make sure their brms business relationship managers their bdms business development managers uphold that code of practice where there are clear breaches of the code these are fed back to us and they go straight to board level at the pubco we know that in those cases where issues have been referred to us action has been taken to sort them out
6040871 its around 10 we will provide evidence to the business and enterprise select committee inquiry into pubcos of enquires we have had under the codes
6040872 all i can do as a representative of a professional body is try and ensure that people coming into the industry are as equipped as they can be to understand what the business offering is and have the chance to see the full detail of the proposed relationship
6040873 successful licensees say to me its about being adaptable and not being too proud to steal other peoples ideas
6040874 i suppose one has been the way the awarding body biiab has grown when i started it was doing about 60 or 70 000 qualifications a year now its about 200 000 now its number six in the league table of national uk awarding bodies that means this industry has a really powerful vocational awarding body going into a massive period of national vocational reform and weve diversified when we started we had about 11 formal assessments for qualifications now its 79 we now offer a business building qualification the profitable business portfolio the schools project nightime economy qualifications a whole range of stuff we cover both on and off trade thats a massive achievement not for me for the team that did it at the same time weve grown membership we now have over 40 000 provisional and permanent members with about 16 000 of these being front line operators across the whole industry
6040875 weve gone to a head hunting agency i wont be on the review panel martin grant chairman will be chairing that it will be a nationwide search and will be advertised in the national press probably in a couple of weeks or so we hope to have a name announced before the end of october
6040876 we know that in those cases where issues have been referred to us action has been taken

6040898 ive used this term so many times but its the only way i can explain it
6040899 i hit the floor and i looked at coach mark williams
6040900 to say that i have five medals at my first olympic games means the world to me

6040924 i was in complete shock i hadnt thought about anything but having another baby with this donor it was just so surprising and bewildering
6040925 id love to give him a full sibling but i just couldnt do it its so unfortunate
6040926 in addition to being tall and well educated their motivations for donation are quite sincere they want to help childless couples they tended to sell out very fast
6040927 theres a huge demand and the fda is essentially saying to these patients they cant choose the characteristics of the children they want even though there is absolutely no scientific evidence on their side

6040936 if glitter continues to refuse to leave he could be put in detention in bangkok and the conditions in prison here are not very good at all worse than in vietnam
6040937 thai immigration chiefs have told thai airways to deal with him they are talking to british authorities to try and get a deal to bring him back home
6040938 he has had access to british tv in his hotel and knows that if he does come back he might never be able to leave again
6040939 thai airlines are looking for someone who would take him at the moment but that is not an easy task
6040940 no one wants to inherit the problem that thailand has at the moment
6040941 it is a very unusual situation the thai government will have to order his expulsion and do have the power to expel him
6040942 we cant do anything to bring him back to the uk as he hasnt committed an offence in this country
6040943 i suspect he will end up back here because he is a uk citizen everyone else has the right to refuse him but we dont
6040944 as a former police officer i know that we have enough convicted sex offenders in this country as it is at the moment

6040954 as for dempo they dont want any injury to their players before the afc cup so we cant do anything
6040955 they had earlier confirmed participation the aiff had cleared it and sent a request to afc who in turn had to send it to fifa and only after that it goes to the external affairs ministry it takes a lot of time and as the tournament had been advanced by two months the process could not completed
6040956 we have built a robust infrastructure that can support a very large operation of franchised and corporate stores
6040957 all of our stores provide delivery and catering services the market response to catering has been tremendous in the stores that are really rolling out catering in their communities it is showing up as 10 20 of their sales the most logical extension to increase unit volumes for us is catering because it hits the same day part at the same time as long as a store is capable operationally of handling it it is the easiest one to go after because you are going to them and they are coming to you at the same day time
6040958 interestingly the fast casual segment and lunch segment have probably been the least affected people like to get out of the office at lunchtime and people still have office meetings and require catering the casual and fine dining segments are being impacted much more significantly that fast casual
6040959 we have projected revenues for 2008 of 4 million from corporate stores and franchise fees in order to become profitable we need somewhere between 75 100 operating stores the exact number will depend upon the mix of corporate to franchise stores

6041219 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6041220 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6041221 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6041222 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6041223 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6041224 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

6041229 it goes against my better instincts but im going to cap my guys at 180 pitches

6041231 fortunately yesterday i was able to get johnny cueto out after just 111 pitches
6041232 but hes a young guy so i was anxious to get him out of there anyway not because of his pitch count but because i had some veterans i needed to get in the game for the rest of the series its 180 pitches or bust with bust being their labrum

6041345 the issuance by the honorable court of a temporary restraining order tro coupled by present conditions in some areas in mindanao dictate that the moa in its present form must undergo a thorough review
6041346 in fact the executive department will pursue further negotiations with the milf to address the issues hurled against the moa
6041347 you noticed that the language says it will undergo further review and that the negotiations shall be further undertaken with the end view of reaching a final peace agreement so there is no need to strike down the moa
6041348 now we will have to await what the supreme courts response will be to the manifestations of the solicitor generals office
6041349 i think it goes without saying when they said there will be a thorough review and that they will pursue further negotiations it indicates that the flaws that may have been observed in the existing moa need to be reviewed in light of the things that came out as a result of the petitions submitted before the supreme court
6041350 the governments position now on that is that we would like to further conduct negotiations
6041351 it is a reality that they milf cannot control their people if they cannot control their people and they validate that and you enter into an agreement then you will have a problem
6041352 there is even no basis for them to go into these atrocities now just because they are impatient will we understand them killing people and burning houses does their impatience justify these acts these are barbaric acts that they did
6041353 indeed there are major items that need to be reviewed in the moa if we want to come up with something more acceptable to the public

6041490 we would love to hear from her about coming on to the show
6041491 theres no reason why she couldnt appear as a celebrity in dictionary corner
6041492 this is a man who was allegedly involved in a substantial drugs transaction
6041493 the thought of him going to corfu having been involved on such a scale is something the public would have concerns about
6041494 ach wei t du die idee einer download aktion spukt uns schon lange im kopf herum sp testens als unsere letzte platte wochen vor dem offiziellen release den weg ins netz fand haben wir berlegt wie man sich am geeignetsten auf die neuen rezeptionsgewohnheiten einstellen k nnte
6041495 es ist doch so die musik ist meistens lange fertig komponiert aber als band musst du anschlie end ca drei monate rumsitzen und auf die pressmaschinerie warten das ist nicht mehr zeitgem
6041496 nat rlich bieten wir zehn neue songs an aber man muss es trotzdem in erster linie als service am fan sehen es geht heutzutage darum musik so schnell wie m glich herzukriegen gleichzeitig bin ich felsenfest davon berzeugt dass ein gro teil der leute die diese woche den download kaufen sich sp ter auch das endg ltige album besorgen vielen unserer fans ist dieser haptische aspekt enorm wichtig
6041497 ich denke nicht dass die leute uns deshalb als raffgierig bezeichnen werden
6041498 in dieser diskussion existiert ein oft bersehener unterschied zu anderen bands radiohead sind eine vertraglose band
6041499 would usually smile and nod and say that i understood the skepticism but that there was and always had been another tradition to politics a tradition based on the simple idea that we have a stake in one another and that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart and that if enough people believe in the truth of that proposition and act on it then we might not solve every problem but we can get something meaningful done
6041500 enough of them appreciated my earnestness and youthful swagger that i made it to the illinois legislature
6041501 s ome of the problems include printing registered voters name sic instead of writing a female voter got married after she registered to vote and signed her maiden name registered voters signed the petitions but dont live in the 13th district
6041502 little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things
6041503 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
6041504 any fool can criticize condemn and complain and most fools do
6041505 the state is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
6041506 when somebody persuades me that i am wrong i change my mind what do you do
6041507 whatever it is that government does sensible americans would prefer that the government do it to someone else this is the idea behind foreign policy
6041508 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing
6041509 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity
6041510 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with inherent and inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governme walt whitman

6041512 the soldiers will be sent to mindanao to maintain peace and order to ensure the preservation of our national territory for it to be intact and to protect the people from harm
6041513 we will also be redistributing our manpower to cover the bases of the 65th ib
6041514 the troops bound for mindanao were responsible for making the islacom pusa of the cpp npa operating in catanduanes irrelevant
6041515 its a big loss but theres a greater concern in mindanao we already coordinated with the police in addressing the internal security operations here in catanduanes
6041516 i hid near him if i feel frightened ill always run to him tonys a friendly giant but i wouldnt mess with him
6041517 dannii was really shaken by the whole experience so it was decided to have a few more heavies on set just in case something as traumatic happened again
6041518 producers appreciate things get heated on occasion but they never anticipated things would kick off quite as much
6041519 it was quite eye opening to say the least for fellow judge cheryl cole who had never seen a confrontation quite like that on the show before
6041520 she gave dannii a kiss and a cuddle afterwards to make sure she was ok but was trembling quite alot herself
6041521 pharmaceuticals play a central role in treatment of children with asthma but parents see them as only part of the solution to their childs condition
6041522 parents seek information on managing their childrens lifestyle as well as alternative therapies to complement the action of the medication to meet these caregivers needs for a range of ways to help their child cope drug companies may wish to increase efforts in patient education to become a valued information source and not just one treatment option among many in the market
6041523 there has been steady growth in use of the internet for both informational needs and emotional support around management of chronic conditions
6041524 pharmaceutical brand marketers need to understand the online context for patients and caregivers

6041533 id like some time to enjoy married life before the kids start coming
6041534 and in lane 4 we have suns javafx used by web properties such as well its still in development
6041535 this isnt the type of market where only one technology is going to win
6041536 i think sun has the opportunity to catch up very quickly in that space
6041537 i would say that the javafx platform looks very good it has a lot of potential
6041538 it probably should have been announced three four five years ago
6041539 technically javafx enables me to leverage the java skill set and java technology that i am more comfortable with to deliver a compelling ria solution because synergy between javafx and java is excellent and the fact that javafx is built on the java platform means that i can ensure that i have one of the best and supportive platforms to work in in addition javafx will enable me to be more productive in making it easier and quicker to create ria solutions
6041540 a powerful client technology for creating rich internet applications with immersive media and content across the multiple screens of your life
6041541 javafx script the language of javafx doesnt replace swing the core java gui toolkit but provides an alternative way of programming that hopefully will bring java technology to the masses
6041542 javafx takes that momentum and the advantages we have with java but makes it much easier to create rich interactive and immersive experiences
6041543 it matches the way they think about interfaces in their head and is very intuitive
6041544 the update provides a much faster loading process for the applets
6041545 the platform promises a lot of new apis and new abstractions to make the harder things simpler and the simpler things very easy

6041551 we have tremendous respect for the style of worcester magazine and its niches as an alternative city weekly
6041552 its a tough time right now and allen fletcher has sunk a lot of time not to mention money into it
6041553 now the prospects of having solid journalism and solid arts reporting will be the slimmest theyve been in the history of the magazine but maybe theyll surprise me
6041554 had a loyal readership that stuck with it for 30 years
6041555 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
6041556 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
6041557 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behaviour
6041558 tell him hes fucking amazing and i want to meet him
6041559 though the percentage increase is slight it represents a significant rise in the amount theyll actually be spending
6041560 the data reveal a remarkable resilience of the smb advertising segment in the face of economic pressures on local consumers and businesses

6041635 i find it to be a most eloquent way to describe the shadows in which my mother lived after her parents were taken from this earth in terms of living or dying she no longer knew how to live but quickly found out how to go about dying
6041636 i sincerely wish someone like the character andy dufresne would have written to my mother about hope

6041638 an ordinary family would fall to pieces thats been my observation over the years ive been very impressed with the houser family they never expected special treatment theyve been nothing but helpful these are truly innocent victims maybe thats one of the reasons this case is so poignant for me
6041639 everyone in the family agrees 100 percent that she never got over the shock of finding the bodies
6041640 her guiding compass she tried to heal she even worked in the das office for a while helping other victims my dad always told us to trust the system but the system of justice has let us down so many times she just couldnt survive it all she had such a hard time living after their deaths

6041642 when i was 17 years old i came into this prison just like you guys
6041643 less than a year later i was wearing blue too been wearing it ever since today i dont know when or if ill ever go home
6041644 of part of a family i destroyed whenever i feel sorry for myself about being in prison i pull out a smaller copy and remember why i am here
6041645 they were my age when i took their parents from them
6041646 im 28 years old today and i cant imagine living the rest of my life without my parents for the last 10 years thats all theyve known because of me and thats all theyre ever gonna know
6041647 as we were doing this we ended up going right by his house
6041648 he was being real helpful real cooperative so we let him visit with his mother for a few minutes and pick up some clothes for court
6041649 walking through the house im thinking you know this is a normal family i was astounded by that were talking mom dad and apple pie here im looking around his room and theres a number of hardy boys mysteries on his bookshelf that kind of stuff airplane and car models the typical things youd see in a normal boys room it made me wonder about his connection with randy guzek how could you get sucked into that relationship because the difference in the two homes is like night and day
6041650 i dont know that ill ever have that answer an answer i can live with
6041651 i wish i could see in my mind the tape of what was going on what i was thinking why i didnt say wait a minute stop this there wasnt that moment here we are 18 years later and i still dont have an answer i dont know where else to look if it is there i dont know how to unlock it its something id like to do before i die
6041652 mark does not believe he is worthy of forgiveness because what he did was unforgivable
6041653 mark rarely talks about the murders but when he does it is with an unflinching honesty that at once horrifies and confuses
6041654 early on i hoped they would be able to look at the things i did and say he is doing something positive
6041655 but i realized they dont give a damn what i do i still have to do it ill never reach the place where the scale is balanced where ive righted that wrong but id be doing an even greater wrong by doing nothing if im not trying to better myself and help other people my existence in here is pointless
6041656 he was raised to be the person he is in there
6041657 mark is who he was supposed to be now hes just not where hes supposed to be he has a brilliant mind in all honesty i dont know if he would have used it on the outside i think when he comes out hell help people who are still in there hell try to make amends for what hes done and hell never do it

6041661 very seldom do i find kids abuse victims who survive

6041663 tammy never forgot your memory isnt like a computer where you can wipe out the program but tammy could override the program mimi mary anne christman couldnt
6041664 when she didnt get close to people its not that she came out of this unscathed she hasnt i have no idea how you can get past that i dont think i could
6041665 but she never gave up she didnt quit a large part of that was her realization that there was more to life than what had happened to her and she wanted that she was bound and determined that this was not going to be her life
6041666 she could have sunk into the morass and she didnt
6041667 my mom shes a warrior i admire her just for sticking with me throughout this whole thing my family too i definitely owe this to them

6041735 a lot of people like playing ball but not a lot of people knew about the tournament so we put up flyers and started talking to people to get the word out weve gotten a pretty good response to this and we expect a lot of people out here today
6041736 the reward is that were going to be in a league and were going to be in the tournament

6041762 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
6041763 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
6041764 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
6041765 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change

6041780 what weve heard from the players is they want to be in it
6041781 we are not going to shut down the season thats the reality
6041782 we should have waited for two weeks after the july 5 trials to name a final team to the games because one of the athletes who did well at the trials was definitely not at his best but we only realised this later
6041783 paul koech who was fourth at the trials ran the seasons best in europe after the trials but we had declared that was the final team at the trials we should not have done and we shall not do that again
6041784 it was a fluid situation and we did not know how to wiggle through it because the strongest steeplechaser this season was beaten at the trials and we were not ready to take the flak again but let the top three at the trials represent us at the olympics
6041785 the problem was who to drop among kemboi kipruto and mateelong who finished in that order at the trials with koech coming in fourth
6041786 i wouldnt be surprised i wouldnt be shocked nothing he does shocks me at this point
6041787 to run a 19 3 hes going to have to run the curve a lot better hes going to have to hold that speed for a very very long time
6041788 thats not the most easy thing to do even for him
6041789 it was the most impressive athletic performance ive ever seen in my life
6041790 i thought he was going to run 9 69 but i didnt think hed been able to run 9 62 which i think he couldve done if he ran through the finish line and tied up his shoe
6041791 typically in the past if an athlete was 6 feet 5 inches 1
6041792 hes been able to take the long stride he has and been able to coordinate that and achieve a very long stride that combination is deadly as the people in the 100 race found out
6041793 if i play well over these next two weeks i think ive got a chance
6041794 i think id be a useful addition to the team ive played the last five matches and weve won four of them so my record at least speaks for itself
6041795 im desperate to make it six but the bottom line is going to be how im playing going into the match

6041829 they doubled and tripled on yao for sure i dont agree with some of those decisions
6041830 sometimes it didnt look like basketball the decisions lithuania were making
6041831 we had a problem we were not ready for this
6041832 i think we got this far with our courage but we had our limitations
6041833 of course we are disappointed but we have no regrets
6041834 but if we earn the chance weve got to face the challenge and compete against them

6041843 the amount of software is growing very rapidly and it is increasingly difficult to find the people and resources necessary to develop it all
6041844 as a result europe is seeing a lot of development work transferring to india and other countries an additional problem lies in the speed of development as it is necessary to get solutions to market in optimum time and with sufficient reliability that it works properly
6041845 agile is a new paradigm for software development that emerged around eight years ago in the usa
6041846 when we started the itea project in 2004 we did not know whether this new methodology could be exploited for embedded software in avionics telecommunications automotive and consumer electronics
6041847 we turned this around to identify those critical features that would be used and put the emphasis on getting them to market first
6041848 so we are not always talking about technical issues when developing software but focusing on business level issues and this was part of the methodology of our development
6041849 eureka projects involve a lot less bureaucracy than with the eu framework programme projects
6041850 moreover over three years the world changes and with eureka you can change the direction of the project meeting better the demands of the industrial partners this is the clear advantage of eureka in addition itea offers a community that meets on a yearly basis and people get to know each other i think both industry and academia find this big networking element strengthens their capabilities
6041851 a set of values and a set of 12 principles provide the underlying rationale for why we operate in this way
6041852 and the process is very tightly time framed with delivery in monthly or even fortnightly cycles in previous approaches we were trying to deliver working systems in maybe three month six month or even one year cycles
6041853 these short cycles demand a radical change in thinking in the development of large hardware bound systems it requires the ability to deliver every two weeks or monthly and so requires rethinking of the whole system how we plan and how we estimate the costs of the development another crucial element is technological requiring investment but the benefits are quite clear
6041854 we showed we could actually achieve up to 70 reduction in lead time and costs
6041855 if these results could be sustained in the larger area of european software development it would be cheaper to outsource from india to europe than the other way round
6041856 we set a benchmark that we can achieve dramatic improvements in all areas in terms of time cost and quality which help shape the future of software development in europe
6041857 we have been able to go beyond what is being done in the usa currently putting europe ahead and while development teams in india and other countries have now set up their own technologies in this area europe has a competitive edge that should last several years
6041858 in the uk alone two million people have diabetes and up to 750 000 are believed to be carriers of the condition without even realising
6041859 these are worrying statistics but by diagnosing the disease in patients early on a number of measures can be put in place to minimise any related health issues findings from this research could really help with early diagnosis if opticians were equipped with the knowledge and technology to spot health concerns which could indicate the first signs of diabetes the uks early diagnosis rate could be improved significantly

6041872 it was a really poor area at that time a group of white men were heckling ray and then she shouted back at them
6041873 some west indian men turned up it was just a scuffle between the black and white men but that was the incident which set off the riot weekend
6041874 at the climax of the riots the mob surged out of notting dale to the east across ladbroke grove to attack the colville area
6041875 they showed us we had to work in partnership to make things better for all people

6041881 there is a real buzz coming down on the waterfront its very exciting with all the big developments
6041882 university campus suffolk is about to open up and that looks fantastic
6041883 the waterfront is really starting to show itself as the jewel in ipswichs crown
6041884 what weve done is design a sort of cuboid shaped building which relates well to the existing building
6041885 what weve got is quite a strong terracotta coloured metal clad building with very luxurious rooms inside
6041886 the salthouse is the first four star luxury hotel on the waterfront and its the most prominent one and we want it to stay that way
6041887 were hoping to be up and running with the new building within about 12 months

6041893 im definitely excited were coming together at the right time
6041894 i go out there trying to get better every day theres always something you can do better i have learned to have a little more composure
6041895 its so hard and i try not to think about it
6041896 a lot can happen between now and then i just take every day as a new blessing
6041897 significant competition problems arose from baas ownership of seven uk airports
6041898 i greatly welcome provisional findings from the competition commission which conclude that baa should sell two of its three london airports
6041899 i have argued for the break up of baa since i was shadow transport minister four years ago so i am delighted that the competition commission has now confirmed my view
6041900 this almost certainly means that baa will have to sell stansted and will no longer be able to use its revenue from heathrow to subsidise uneconomic expansion of stansted
6041901 i very much hope that the future owners of stansted will recognise the airport has already reached its maximum sustainable capacity and will immediately shelve baas plans for either a second runway or increased passenger numbers
6041902 sse has long argued for a break up of baa and is therefore delighted by todays provisional findings report from the competition commission concluding that baa must sell two of its three london airports
6041903 we consider it inconceivable that baa would willingly sell heathrow which means that stansted and gatwick must both be sold
6041904 this will not in itself remove the threat of a second runway at stansted but we believe it moves us a step closer to the day when this idea will be abandoned suffolk homes
6041905 the concrete was chipped and it was dangerous and there is also a lot of chewing gum
6041906 the shop will be a lot smarter and welcoming i think people will take notice
6041907 they are putting a lot of work in to improve the town for people coming from outside ipswich they are also trying to support the town so the public feel more proud of it
6041908 business is picking up and is strong not as many people have gone on holiday so i think they are treating themselves by buying a guitar for example
6041909 k mpfen ist in tomb raider ein anschlussgedanke sie die entwickler anm d red versuchen interessante gefechte zu erzeugen und sie werden dabei immer besser aber es ist wirklich etwas anderes
6041910 samantha who does the band break up does the band get back together for a big gig
6041911 this athlete has tested positive her b sample will be opened later today and there will be a hearing tomorrow
6041912 we live in a society where people cheat doping is never in the past we cant lower our guard
6041913 its a different field if you will but its no less important
6041914 its a privilege to represent this state particularly we have a great tradition here ted kennedy and going back to john quincy adams
6041915 twelve billion dollars a month a month are being spent in place where there was no al qaida and there were no weapons of mass destruction and the place where there is they have ignored sufficiently that its now at great risk
6041916 im smart enough to know that in this new way that congress works you very rarely get the slot where you can bring a bill that has your own name on it to the floor
6041917 usually youre trying to attach something to something else to get it passed
6041918 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6041919 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6041920 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6041921 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6041922 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6041923 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
6041924 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
6041925 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause
6041926 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function
6041927 association between 24 hour urinary cadmium and pulmonary function among community exposed men the va normative aging study
6041928 proceeds generated from the mens event are used to provide seed grants for prostate cancer research the nih does not support high risk new research with grant funding until scientific projects are well underway
6041929 philanthropy provides a tremendous return on investment for our donors and our patients
6041930 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
6041931 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
6041932 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
6041933 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
6041934 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system
6041935 it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information
6041936 a lot of research efforts are devoted to the basic science of stem cells
6041937 this work is focused on the immediate practicalities of actually using these cells therapeutically
6041938 this imaging modality allows us to see things weve never been able to see before
6041939 we shine light on a nanotube and listen to the ultrasound waves coming out of it
6041940 we will be able to ask a tumor are you responding to chemotherapy or not
6041941 this should give us early information long before the tumor shrinks or grows
6041942 for decades we have been able to make images of anatomy
6041943 but seeing anatomy and seeing the molecular characteristics of tissue are completely different with this technique we can see not just symptoms of disease were truly seeing the actual disease
6041944 the lhc is a discovery machine we dont know what well find
6041945 im actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the higgs
6041946 weve been debating this for 30 years and one way or another the lhc will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs thats a fundamental advance
6041947 its a tough game you can only do it by statistical analysis since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a higgs boson signal
6041948 by itself the higgs is a very puzzling particle so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know
6041949 initially well be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly in 2009 we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry
6041950 these large projects take such a long time we have to start early
6041951 weve been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles
6041952 nature gives us these cosmic rays for free and theyre the same kinds of particles well see when the machine turns on so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector but were very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine
6041953 well be throwing away a lot of data so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly
6041954 the graduate students and postdocs get to go to geneva but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment
6041955 there is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at ucsc which is not the case at other leading institutions
6041956 for me its valuable just in terms of being aware of whats happening on the experimental side
6041957 if nothing were found beyond what we know today that would be so radical because it would be in violation of a lot of extremely fundamental principles
6041958 the key reason for the revival in early rising culture is that it teaches people to control their emotions feelings and desires
6041959 it is training in spiritual determination so that people feel motivated to contribute selflessly to a common cause
6041960 that cause can often be economic but there are clear signs that many of these movements encourage people to take pride in their country and the part they play in japanese life in some ways they are being urged to overcome their own spiritual weaknesses and replace them with nationalist pride
6041961 early rising is believed to help a person suppress their emotions or physical desires and become more morally fortified
6041962 that idea has become more potent with the revival in japanese nationalism it is no coincidence that nation wide initiatives to encourage early rising have regained momentum at a time when japanese leaders have worked towards increasing love for the nation
6041963 early cancer detection is a very challenging but important goal for the cancer field
6041964 this modeling work enables a very deep understanding of the problems that will have to be solved for blood based cancer biomarkers to be successful in this effort
6041965 were pretty happy that we came up with rather realistic tumor sizes
6041966 although this is a very basic model it should give researchers a tool to use when deciding if a particular secreted protein would be a good biomarker
6041967 were making assumptions about how tumors behave in the human body
6041968 although theres not always a linear relationship between tumor size and secretion levels our model identifies some important characteristics of a good biomarker we also try to point out additional physiological parameters and studies needed to develop more precise models
6041969 it would be helpful to have a panel of biomarkers that complement each other
6041970 a lot of effort is going in to finding the perfect panel and we hope that this work will help researchers home in on specific candidates
6041971 if i have anything unusual or interesting to report i do then i ask for an update on her week and then were finished until the next week sometimes our calls last longer of course but most times theyre brief
6041972 meanwhile the war mccains never come to grips with continues to go down the crapper
6041973 sen john mccain of arizona close to clinching the gop nomination called sen barack obama naive today and blasted him for advocating a bombing of al qaeda hide outs in pakistan
6041974 i have a car but i try not to use it
6041975 wir wollen ihm einen vertrag anbieten damit er kawasaki werksfahrer bleibt denn wir haben viel in ihn investiert um ihn einen level nach oben zu bringen seit er voriges jahr zu uns gesto en ist
6041976 i think its pretty clear that a lot of it is attributable to gas prices
6041977 our 50cc scooters are unchanged but for a some new colors
6041978 all manufacturers are caught wondering what to do to keep up with demand
6041979 scooters just dont change much certain style things change and there has been significant engine design improvements but there isnt much change unless its a whole new model
6041980 bevor ich auf vier r dern begonnen habe bin ich etwas motocross gefahren aber ich habe mir zu viele knochen gebrochen ich kam zum kartsport und machte dann bei den autos weiter aber ich habe die motorr der immer geliebt und ich bin immer beeindruckt was diese jungs auf zwei r dern schaffen

6042039 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe

6042154 we found that survival for teenagers and young people with cancer improved overall from 63 between 1979 and 1984 to 74 between 1996 and 2001 which is great news
6042155 but more needs to be done to drive this figure even higher
6042156 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically
6042157 research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6042158 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated
6042159 recruiting more young people onto clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this
6042160 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates that the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones were no more than a show

6042163 we want everyone to express their opinion everyone has the right to speak this is not the same as demonstrating
6042164 we asked for as much transparency as possible and we asked that the areas should be genuinely used
6042165 the olympics are about sport we are aware of the wider issues but opening the door through the olympics is a catalyst for development here that catalytic effect is happening but the olympics are not a panacea for all ills

6042214 what im hearing from others whove been to fiji is that the commodore is not just baulking at the commitment for march 2009
6042215 there is no timetable for 2009 2010 2012 or any other time
6042216 let me place on record that the commitments that commodore bainimarama made at the leaders retreat were not forced on him as some have claimed

6042276 i played a festival recently and i put up a peace sign and got the crowd to put up a peace sign it was written in the music press that my asking people to put up a peace sign was a crassism
6042277 now if its a crassism to ask people to put up a peace sign at a time when were at war in two countries were shafted and therefore im going to retire from the music industry in january because im disgusted by it i dont want anying to do with it any more
6042278 im going to retire from the music industry because its run by rich white men who are very conservative and have been around too long they dont wanna hear anybody with anything truly rebellious to say and thats why british indie music has stalled for the last ten years
6042279 we thought it would be a useful experiment to see what we could do to reduce the carbon emissions associated with releasing a record the initial aim was to make it carbon neutral but it soon became apparent this would be impossible given the power needed to run the servers for delivering the tracks in to itunes nevertheless i believe this should still be the greenest record release yet when i mentioned the idea to the wave pictures they asked if they could be the ones to do it and suggested they could walk to the studio from their house
6042280 its not britpop lets put it that way its not our usual thing

6042291 wie had zich tot de naaste van de gewonde man gemaakt
6042292 jezus zei als afmaker ga heen en doet gij evenzo
6042293 je moet zelf tot inzicht komen dat je verkeerd bezig bent hij kijkt naar je uit en hij zal je warm verwelkomen zonder je nog eens te bestraffen want dat heb je zelf al gedaan
6042294 wat u niet wil wat u geschiedt doet dan ook een ander niet
6042295 nodig vrije weekend is voorbij en het werk roept en dan zijn de mensen niet zo vrolijk
6042296 kan ook duiden op tijdsperioden in het nederlands kennen wij dat begrip ook als wij het hebben over de oude dag
6042297 we weten uit de ontstaansgeschiedenis van de aarde dat de aarde eerst gloeiend heet was dus er zijn behoorlijk wat jaren voorbijgegaan eer zich water op aarde kon bevinden
6042298 met miljoenen jaren maar laten we nu eens puur de bijbel raadplegen let eens op genesis 2 vers 2 daar wordt w l de aanvang van de zevende dag
6042299 al jarenlang werk ik voor u en nooit ben ik u ongehoorzaam geweest als u mij iets opdroeg en u hebt mij zelfs nooit een geitenbokje gegeven om met mijn vrienden feest te vieren 30 maar nu die zoon van u is thuisgekomen die uw vermogen heeft verkwanseld aan de hoeren hebt u voor hem het gemeste kalf geslacht
6042300 om zich in te laten met de belastinginners en de hoeren
6042301 niet kenden zijzelf waren de schuldigen die ervoor gezorgd hadden dat het volk zo van god afgedreven waren en natuurlijk was is ieder afzonderlijk verantwoordelijk voor zijn haar daden en handelwijze
6042302 mijn jongen jij bent altijd bij me en alles wat van mij is is van jou
6042303 wat houdt dit in gewoon wat bij elke christen het geval dient te zijn gods zaken of belangen op de eerste plaats stellen zie oa mattheus 28 vers 19 en 20 en mattheus 24 vers 13 en 14 want als je jong bent inderdaad dan heb je de toekomst m r ook nog je energie en kracht nog geen veranwoordelijkheden als je vrijgezel bent etc want lees nu eens de rest van prediker 12 dan zul je zien dat de rampspoedige dagen

6042307 heeft alleen betrekking op de scheppingswerken wat de aarde betreft ook hierbij een korte notitie dit betreffen geen letterlijke dagen van 24 uur gezien de vondsten die af en toe worden gedaan wat betreft uitgestorven dieren is dit ook niet logisch we spreken in dit geval over scheppingsperioden die enige duizenden jaren per dag
6042308 dit omhelst natuurlijk een langere periode dan een letterlijke dag van 24 uur als men rekent vanaf 65 jaar als men met pensioen gaat dan het om 10 20 of ook wel om 40 jaar gaan
6042309 lukas 15 2 nieuwe wereldvertaling van de heilige schrift uitgave 2004
6042310 in lukas 15 2 het was dus niet n keer dat de geestelijke
6042311 wilde niet zeggen dat hij het eens was met datgene waar ze mee bezig waren de farize n e a waren alleen maar uit om hun positie en macht te handhaven zij bekommerden zich niet om de geestelijke welzijn van de verloren schapen

6042314 en bepalen dat anderen wel of niet god allah jah jahweh jehovah dienen en daarom ter dood gebracht moet worden
6042315 komt en laten wij opgaan naar de berg van jehovah naar het huis van de god van jakob en hij zal ons onderrichten omtrent zijn wegen en wij willen zijn paden bewandelen
6042316 leven plaats je jezelf op de troon van god eigen rechter spelen heeft nou niet bepaald zijn goedkeuring integendeel probeer de leer van jezus te volgen die heeft gezegd
6042317 het betekent iets doen wat jouw vervolger nooit verwacht nl dat je hem haar met respect behandeld niet een eigen koekje van eigen deeg geeft en dus niet naar het leven staat juist door tegengesteld te handelen aan datgene wat de vervolger doet of heeft gedaan zal hij in verlegenheid worden gebracht hopelijk en kan hij zij gaan inzien dat hij verkeerd bezig is laat de wraak aan god over want als je iemand zijn leven ontneemt ook al zijn er gegronde redenen voor dan laad je bloedschuld op je en kan god aan jou rekenschap vragen bed nk dat god ook zegt hij die geweld liefheeft haat mijn ziel stellig
6042318 lukas 9 vers 23 nieuwe wereldvertaling van de heilige schrift uitgave 2004 je maakt je niet populair in de hedendaagse maatschappij als je zegt dat je een christen ben en wil doen wat de vader van je verlangt de huidige wereld legt de nadruk op het ik
6042319 en dat soort kreten maar als je gedoopt bent kan dus geen on bijbelse kinderdoop zijn want het moet een bewuste keus zijn een kind kan nog niet kiezen dus als ouder beslis je voor een kind terwijl hetzelfde kind later daar helemaal niet zo blij mee is want het was zijn haar keuze niet maar een aan hem haar opgedrongen feit en je gekozen hebt voor het doen van gods wil moet je je zelf verloochenen
6042320 kunnen volgen nu zijn we op een cruciaal punt beland is het voornemen van god omvan de aarde een paradijs te maken en de mens eeuwig te laten leven mislukt nee he le maal niet hoogstens uitgesteld omdat nu nog steeds de vraag loopt wie het recht heeft om alles te besturen god of satan maar god nam wel meteen maatregelen om het herstel tot het paradijs in gang te zetten in genesis 3 vers 15 staat deze profetie opgetekend laten wij deze tekst eens even ontleden personen die genoemd worden u de vrouw uw zaad haar zaad tegen wie sprak god deze worden uit tegen de slang of liever gezegd degene die van de slang gebruikt maakte nl satan de slang is zoals reeds eerder geproken een redeloos dier en kon kan helemaal niet praten er zal vijandschap komen tussen satan en de vrouw welke vrouw eva kon het niet zijn die was immers ten dode opgeschreven en voor de rest waren er nog geen vrouwen op aarde wie is die vrouw dan buiten eva was er dus adam geen vrouw dus dat is meteen duidelijk god zelf jah jahweh jehovah jezus christus en de engelen engelen hadden hebben verantwoordelijkheden en zijn ingedeeld in o a cherubs serafs aartsengel en gewone
6042321 zoals eerder vastgesteld gods hemelse organisatie bestaande uit jahweh engelen en jezus christus
6042322 door zijn zaad zou komen wegens het geloof van abraham heeft god dat aan hem beloofd wie of wat was nou dat zaad 16 nu werden aan abraham de beloften gedaan en aan zijn zaad hij zegt niet en aan zijn zaden in het meervoud maar in het enkelvoud en aan uw zaad dat wil zeggen aan christus nbg uitgave 1951 dus jezus christus ter zijner tijd als mens als messias zou het zaad

6042324 ik geef je op een briefje dat binnen een week er een behoorlijk aantal fietsen staan
6042325 om allen die tot de weg behoorden en die hij er vond zowel mannen als vrouwen geboeid naar jeruzalem te brengen
6042326 de indruk bestaat of god hier bedoelt dat er van beide kanten fouten zijn gemaakt dan kan natuurlijk niet want god zelf zondigt niet maakt geen fouten zijn eigenschgappen zijn immers liefde gerechtigheid wijsheid en macht
6042327 ons niet aanrekenen natuurlijk moeten wij proberen die fouten in de toekomst te vermijden bij ernstige overtredingen komt het woordje berouw
6042328 dus spijt en verdriet hebben is stap 1 een verandering van zienswijze en een andere richting inslaan is stap 2 dus dan is het rood weg en het is weer smetteloos wit zuiver aanvaardbaar voor god en het mooiste is dat hij niet zal reageren als mensen wel eens doen mochten er weer problemen rijzen mensen reageren dan van ja maar 10 jaar geleden heb je mij ook al al eens iets geflikt

6042402 estoy contento por el resultado porque ganar unos cuartos en los juegos siempre es importante el partido contra croacia fue duro pero ahora estamos donde quer amos en las semifinales ol mpicas estoy feliz hemos disfrutado y ahora vamos a prepararnos para las semifinales que van a ser muy dif ciles
6042403 esperaba nuestra intensidad defensiva ante los croatas contra rivales de nivel hay que defender a tope desde el principio para imponer el ritmo empezar con una defensa as nos quita presi n en ataque nos permite marcar el ritmo y nos da mucha ventaja
6042404 ya sabemos como son los cuartos marcan un antes y un despu s en el campeonato si ganas llegas donde todo el mundo quiere estar en la lucha por las medallas pero si los pierdes te vas a casa

6042425 trintechs performance in q2 was solid with revenue growth of 18pc and adjusted ebitda net income of us 215 000 despite the challenges of the economic environment
6042426 however the continued uncertainty in the market has negatively impacted our revenue and earnings results and business outlook for the rest of the year
6042427 following shareholder approval of our share buy back at our recent agm we intend to initiate the purchase of our stock as our board strongly feels that the current trintech share price does not accurately reflect the true enterprise value of the business
6042428 in spite of the difficult economic environment we believe our strategy of focusing on a broader product set expanding our presence in the international market and ensuring an efficient operating cost base will enable trintech to deliver continued year over year growth in revenue and ebitda profitability
6042429 every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
6042430 i think well see consistency becoming crucial towards the end of the season
6042431 that made it really clear to us all how important it is to finish races and pick up good points
6042432 i believe in the old fashioned system of signing people whenever a club decided to but if 24 hours can make a difference then great
6042433 it gives you another day working away at what you are trying to do
6042434 we took shirts off sale at the club shop as soon as we knew about the floors 2 go announcement
6042435 we are already talking to people about the possibility of a new deal but at the moment we dont know what that future is
6042436 we are hoping to hear as soon as possible and when we do we will of course keep the supporters informed
6042437 we were due to launch a new away strip but this has been postponed until we know where we stand with shirt sponsorship

6042440 producers appreciate things get heated on occasion but they never anticipated things would kick off quite as much
6042441 it was quite eye opening to say the least for fellow judge cheryl cole who had never seen a confrontation quite like that on the show before
6042442 she gave dannii a kiss and a cuddle afterwards to make sure she was ok but was trembling quite alot herself
6042443 wij merken dat ondersteunende afdelingen vaak pas in een laat stadium worden ingeschakeld een it afdeling wordt bijvoorbeeld benaderd voor een beheerklus terwijl die al veel eerder ingeschakeld hadden willen en moeten worden op die manier hebben zij ook inspraak in wat zij gaan beheren
6042444 vaak worden die alleen ingeschakeld als het eigenlijk al te laat is en iemand moet worden ontslagen terwijl die graag mee zouden denken over hoe het niveau van de medewerkers omhoog gebracht kan worden en er een prettige werksfeer gecre erd kan worden
6042445 interventies zijn kleine dingen initiatiefjes waarbij je jouw afdeling promoot
6042446 dat kan op allerlei manieren een afdeling die bezig was met duurzaamheid verzamelde vanuit de inkomende post alle enveloppen die niet dichtgeplakt waren daar plakten ze stickers op met de tekst deze enveloppe wordt hergebruikt door de afdeling x op die manier probeerden ze op een creatieve manier bewustwording onder de andere afdelingen te cre ren
6042447 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
6042448 this is a moment in history when it is vital for the worlds democracies to stand in solidarity
6042449 it doesnt matter how many they have if they are still not letting food get in without delays
6042450 its important for us as fast as possible to establish some sort of a longer term idp solution
6042451 one of the challenges is to determine how many are permanently displaced and how many will go home as soon as the russians leave and how many are somewhere in between
6042452 i believe it is in our own national security interests to stop russia from continuing its aggressive actions against georgia or threatening other countries in the region
6042453 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
6042454 oh i loved it when you were three you were so much fun i wanted you to stay three forever

6042456 it the car came to a halt in a tidal salt water pool known as the sealife rock pool
6042457 one of the major planks of the republican attack on obama is going to be his lack of foreign policy experience
6042458 and so i think he needs somebody who can be very strong in defending the obama ticket in appearing in that vice presidential debate and putting the strongest voice forward for the democratic ticket
6042459 some of those individuals have run for high office in the past so therefore you know what baggage they bring to the race so that would suggest to me that hes much more likely to put somebody with experience on the ticket than someone without experience
6042460 evangelical christianity is now tragically below the new testament standard worldliness is an accepted part of our way of life our religious mood is social instead of spiritual we have lost the art of worship we are not producing saints our models are successful business men celebrated athletes and theatrical personalities we carry on our religious activities after the methods of the modern advertiser our literature is shallow and our hymnody borders on sacrilege and scarcely anyone appears to care
6042461 i dont think its going to be me and my wife is very happy with that
6042462 we are trying to build a crowd of 10 000 or more we are going into the heart of our base involving multiple counties weve got everybody involved in it and were turning the phones loose on it
6042463 the mccain people are saying they want a major event in dayton to draw into the base
6042464 if we can control the clock we can control the tempo of the game
6042465 we have to run the ball keep our offense on the field and have long sustained drives but in a field position contest kickers are more important than ever simmons puts the ball in the end zone most of the time on kickoffs and he can score too he might be our key player
6042466 i dont even remember who we were playing i got all of it though but im a lot stronger this year
6042467 i went to summer camps at northwestern purdue michigan state cincinnati toledo and bowling green i did all of their drills i worked hard and now i have a much better idea of what i am doing
6042468 i do really well in calculus and i am thinking about becoming a mechanical engineer or starting my own business they have a great engineering program
6042469 im lucky that it wasnt my kicking leg but the planting leg is important too i did a lot of lifting and my knee is stronger now than it was before
6042470 we were able to sustain drives but we gave up some big plays because we missed assignments well have to do better
6042471 our goal every year is to win the league if we can do that well be in the playoffs
6042472 ryan locker jaye hood tyler stevens zach carnes clint shepherd and nathan islamovski are all lettermen
6042473 the offensive line is my strongest group were really hoping that slemker is going to benefit from their experience
6042474 if somethings hard to do then its not worth doing
6042475 i didnt do it nobody saw me do it you cant prove anything
6042476 one twenty nine cent stamp thats a dollar eighty five thank you come again
6042477 i have a large district and it takes a lot of work to get out and see these folks
6042478 i just cant justify taking five days off it just makes more sense for me to stay home
6042479 doesnt want to have his picture taken with his presidential nominee whos not qualified to be president
6042480 we want ohios voters and the rest of the nation to see that we have prepared a transparent process of transporting voting equipment ballots and supplies
6042481 jesus agenda is far bigger than just one or two issues we have to care about poverty we have to care about disease we have to care about illiteracy we have to care about corruption in government sex trafficking
6042482 if obama ever establishes any kind of trust with evangelicals there will be a noticeable shift
6042483 it will not be huge but it will be significant
6042484 number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
6042485 the encouraging thing is that in 2004 we didnt have any part in the platform discussion
6042486 this time the party wanted us as a partner in the process they reached out to us and wanted to hear what we had to say
6042487 ive been around a lot of softball over the years as a player and a coach
6042488 this rates as one of the most unbelievable team efforts ive seen
6042489 to come out the losers bracket and win nine straight games is amazing
6042490 we were on the diamond for 14 straight hours in 90 degree heat on that sunday these young ladies never gave up
6042491 style wise tim is a mix of some of my best wrestlers like lammers and daugherty and kyle ott
6042492 he learned a lot from the older kids but hes primarily a takedown leg wrestler
6042493 i know mark ott kyles father and warrior mat coach and hes a good coach for wayne hell be good for the program because hes a dedicated teacher
6042494 i have always taught my children and my wrestlers to set goals for themselves
6042495 when they set goals and strive to achieve them they cant go wrong goals are so important
6042496 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6042497 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6042498 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6042499 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6042500 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6042501 senator barack obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage

6042503 die beiden rankings best tigen die f hrende rolle wiens als internationale kongressmetropole
6042504 denn trotz der verschiedenen z hlkriterien der zwei organisationen liegt wien darin seit jahrzehnten immer im spitzenfeld das wirkt sich auch auf die position von sterreich in den l ndervergleichen aus in der uia liste 2007 wurde so rang 9 erreicht wobei von den insgesamt 366 in sterreich gewerteten internationalen kongressen 81 5 in wien stattfanden
6042505 we will play the match as a message to the world that georgia is capable of doing so
6042506 more than 2 000 soldiers have been killed plus people in the villages maybe 5 000 in all it is terrible
6042507 but playing this game is sending out a message to the world we are a small country but we can show how big we are
6042508 it is hard for us to play to think about football considering what is happening in georgia
6042509 but maybe things are starting to get better and within a few days the russians will have left
6042510 it is hard for us but we have to play the game
6042511 we cannot allow ourselves to feel that because of what is happening that we are not ready for the game we have to play
6042512 the manager has asked us if we are ready because he needs to know
6042513 but we have all said we will play we want to send a message to russia that we can do this
6042514 we also want to show our people and our supporters who will be in the stadium
6042515 i have aspirations to play for hungary again but i must concentrate on gaining a starting place and performing well for cardiff first
6042516 if i can do that then hopefully i can get back into the international set up
6042517 i want the first time to be just us so its perfect and after that anyone can be home i dont care
6042518 i had also asked why the myth busters didnt appear when the gospel accounts contradicted one another he says gospel harmonies and other sources did that very thing really is he talking about tatian writing in the 5th century because i dont think tatian would qualify as an eyewitness or contemporary if hes going to appeal to tatian why not also appeal to gleason archer or josh mcdowell what we have here are vagueries we need specifics

6042807 not because its boring it isnt boring but it is like reading a technical manual its got that much detail in it the words dont make much sense to me because i dont have much understanding of the material ive got no interest in
6042808 hes taken the device that this is an origin story for glamourpuss except glamourpuss isnt really a character
6042809 he seems to be deliberately playing up to and teasing his critics

6042824 we are focused on uk broadcasters and what we can do for our us network and sister cable channels
6042825 what this deal does for us is create a truly unique production model it is a very difficult time to be a small or mid size production company

6042834 after 75 years of document based static financial reporting whether in paper documents or in electronic equivalents it is exciting to see the sec poised to cross the data threshold and help investors receive financial information that is dynamic usable and ready to go as they make their investment decisions and when the investor wins so does the public company fund or other filer who simultaneously benefits from greater transparency and trust in our markets by tapping the power of interactive data to tear down barriers to quick and meaningful investment information markets can become fairer and more efficient while investors can possess far better quality data than was ever possible before

6042859 this holiday season may well be the perfect storm for airfare that sends travelers running for cover
6042860 the combination of high fuel prices airline capacity and route cuts means holiday travelers may easily spend upwards of 100 more per ticket than last year there are deals out there for both thanksgiving and christmas but theyre few and far between and wont last long
6042861 many airlines are adding additional fees such as baggage on top of these fares which can push the cost of travel higher
6042862 in 2007 travelers found the best holiday fares in the second week of october
6042863 this year is a whole new game so i recommend anyone who needs to fly on peak travel days to buy as soon as they find a reasonable fare those who do have flexibility in their travel dates should monitor fares closely over the next few months and look for fare drops
6042864 the intense media attention to high airfares has everyone thinking that travel this year is vastly more expensive than ever before and thats just not the case
6042865 for example lets look at an eight day trip for two to miami in september airfare has increased 109 since last year but hotels are 173 less expensive meaning the total trip cost is actually down 64
6042866 savvy travelers know to take advantage of the hotel vacancies in big cities over the holidays
6042867 not only can they book a room in a four star hotel for a two star price but they also have a variety of labor day activities like parades and festivals to celebrate the last holiday of the summer

6042894 our country will be sending humanitarian aid on russian military planes to help the embattled underdogs of mexico if mr bush does not declare a cease fire
6042895 it puts all his peace prize aspirations for a cozy place in history at risk
6042896 this is not 2003 and the invasion of iraq where america can threaten a sovereign country occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
6042897 america has brutally pushed its military operation well beyond the bounds of anything related to discount prescriptions illegal drugs or the protection of its homeland security
6042898 america has sought its place in the 21st century russia has fully supported those efforts but now america puts its aspirations ahead of its balls just like an old golfing bully by taking actions against innocent mexicans that are unwarranted unnecessary and totally udder handed

6043099 his vision is better and hes understanding pass coverages better so hes grown a lot

6043152 thats one bad habit we are trying to break right now
6043153 tight ends did pretty good but they can play better

6043196 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
6043197 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
6043198 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
6043199 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
6043200 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6043202 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6043205 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging

6043208 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself

6043247 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
6043248 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing

6043259 freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be
6043260 disappointment that our bishops conference recently could not agree on a collegial response to the governments legislation on same sex adoption
6043261 attempting to arrive at a consensus among bishops with sometimes divergent views episcopal conference statements and documents have a tendency to be often flat and safe at a time when we need passionate and courageous public statements that dare to speak the full truth in love
6043262 i must admit that during my 15 years as a bishop i have increasingly come to share certain concerns about the relationship between individual bishops and the national conference
6043263 reluctance among the rest of the bishops to speak out on these issues
6043264 results often in the loss of the scandal and the folly of the gospel so that we are no longer the salt and leaven so urgently needed
6043265 confident courageous and prophetic bishops are vital for the well being of the church during this time of increasingly aggressive secularism
6043266 the passion to serve the lord is noticeably absent in many cases there seems to be at times a tiredness and reticence to preach the gospel
6043267 doctrinal and moral teaching in their collaboration with secular agencies
6043268 im thinking in particular of agencies with a responsibility for education or economic development the staff of these agencies are often in a position to witness to the truth of the churchs teaching on say the theology of the body with its positive refutation of pre marital sex safe sex or artificial birth control in their dealings with government departments and committees
6043269 there must be no back peddling on these issues just because certain truths are unwelcome in the corridors of power
6043270 we have talked too much and done too little we have witnessed over the past forty years a growing crisis in the catholic understanding or self identity of the church have we forgotten what it is to be catholic

6043299 dont have to go through the months and months and months of introducing themselves to voters
6043300 an important thing to realize i think is that youre not starting necessarily from where you finished last cycle
6043301 the mistake a candidate can make who got very close last cycle is to assume they start at that point and all they need to do is make up for the 1 000 votes or the 3 000 votes or whatever it is theyre short

6043350 the government has let down an entire generation of pupils who are not getting anything like the basic set of qualifications they need to continue studying or get the job they want

6043354 and standards are also rising in higher attaining schools the number of secondary schools where 70 per cent or more pupils gain five good gcses has risen eleven fold to 891 up from 83 in 1997

6043530 it was to be an experience to be wholly absorbed and felt it was to inspire awe and amazement now for the first time in more than a century the viewer will once again enter a realm in which their senses will if just for a moment place them in the midst of the battle

6043548 as his experience and depth of knowledge in tolling operational requirements will be invaluable as we continue our growth in this market
6043549 our second quarter results in the midst of the real estate market downturn demonstrate unique value
6043550 due to a combination of tight monetary policy and the earthquake in sichuan province real estate transaction volumes in most major cities were down substantially compared to the same period last year our ability to generate growth in transaction volume and value in this market condition further demonstrates our increasing market share and stronger leadership position at the same time our real estate consulting and information service revenue continued its strong growth which helped to deliver impressive performance in our revenues and profits
6043551 looking ahead to the third quarter of 2008 we expect conditions within chinas real estate market to remain challenging compared to the second quarter real estate transaction volumes for july and august in most leading cities will likely show bigger year on year decline this is because july and august of 2007 saw unusually strong transaction activities at the peak of the real estate market boom the 2008 beijing olympic games may have also caused a temporary slowdown in real estate transactions however we are seeing that many developers have adjusted their sales strategy in preparation for the peak season that traditionally begins in september by placing a sharp focus on increasing sales volumes and cash flows this trend combined with our continued belief that the long term fundamental demand for real estate in china remains strong provides compelling reasons for transaction volumes to rebound starting in september
6043552 during the second quarter we achieved strong revenue growth and stable profit margins despite difficult market conditions for the third quarter we expect to continue solid growth in revenue as a result of a larger number of projects sold by us and strong growth in our consulting and information service segment our asset light service oriented business model insulates us from the cash flow problems that many developers face during periods of slow transaction volume moreover a challenging market presents an ideal opportunity for us to expand our market presence and secure additional projects to support future growth

6043712 social enterprise can be a route to fulfilling employment better incomes and greater independence and has the power to transform our country for the better
6043713 significantly for bame women it can enhance the role they play in their local communities we want to develop practical measures for increasing the representation of bame women in their communities and we recognise the multiple benefits from encouraging more of them to enter social enterprise
6043714 social enterprises draw on a diverse range of talent that delivers innovative approaches to some of the most challenging social problems
6043715 bame women can have a better understanding of the issues facing their communities than anyone else so supporting them in particular has great potential to help improve those communities
6043716 this report is an important contribution to the governments drive to encourage and support more people who want to become social entrepreneurs
6043717 encouraging enterprising women from bame communities to connect with social enterprise should be an absolute priority as it will benefit not only those communities but the uk economy as a whole
6043718 social enterprise promotes economic growth and provides meaningful employment across the uk and is empowering and effective among communities that have been traditionally excluded from mainstream business

6043731 washington reuters a u s appeals court on tuesday dismissed former
6043732 significant competition problems arose from baas ownership of seven uk airports
6043733 i greatly welcome provisional findings from the competition commission which conclude that baa should sell two of its three london airports
6043734 i have argued for the break up of baa since i was shadow transport minister four years ago so i am delighted that the competition commission has now confirmed my view
6043735 this almost certainly means that baa will have to sell stansted and will no longer be able to use its revenue from heathrow to subsidise uneconomic expansion of stansted
6043736 i very much hope that the future owners of stansted will recognise the airport has already reached its maximum sustainable capacity and will immediately shelve baas plans for either a second runway or increased passenger numbers
6043737 sse has long argued for a break up of baa and is therefore delighted by todays provisional findings report from the competition commission concluding that baa must sell two of its three london airports
6043738 we consider it inconceivable that baa would willingly sell heathrow which means that stansted and gatwick must both be sold
6043739 this will not in itself remove the threat of a second runway at stansted but we believe it moves us a step closer to the day when this idea will be abandoned suffolk homes

6044100 the geisha sleep in certain positions so as not to disturb their elaborate hairdos and thats what i was just doing

6044168 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6044169 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6044170 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6044171 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6044172 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
6044173 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6044174 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6044175 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
6044176 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

6044200 the bullpen was really good early on but the starters havent been going more than five innings most of the year that puts a lot of pressure on the bullpen
6044201 his slider was good but it was out of the strike zone i think its just a matter of him getting the feel of throwing that pitch for a strike
6044202 this team has showed a lot of character this year by coming from behind as much as they have
6044203 but you cant do that for five months when you are trailing early it puts a lot of pressure on your offense it takes away sacrifice bunts and the hit and run

6044208 when the internet first appeared this heated debate developed among economists
6044209 one side said the internet will make it easier for companies to price discriminate and itll be fabulously profitable the other side argued that the internet will be the great make markets close to perfectly competitive and people much more price sensitive and profits will be highly constrained im probably the leading guy associated with that second position arguably i got lucky but what i wrote basically turned out to be correct

6044215 there are very many ways to make sure he isnt living the easy life
6044216 im going to ask you to recognize not only their loss but to recognize how much suffering and agony shane ragland caused
6044217 to tell him and the world once and for all that this kind of behavior shall not go unpunished
6044218 most of what was said in the civil trial was kathleen lundy type stuff
6044219 it sent an adrenaline shot through me that i will never forget
6044220 i will never forget the look on that guys face when he said that it hit me right between the eyes
6044221 i dont care if everything shane said about him were true this is for him and this is for me
6044222 shell have to live the rest of her life under a different name while shane ragland lives free
6044223 and i dont have a doubt in mind that if he knew where she was he would kill her
6044224 our loss is very personal to us no more so than any other family who has lost a child
6044225 the difference is weve had to share this loss with the entire community for 14 years
6044226 its a club manchester united that makes me dream especially as ruud van nistelrooy played there and did great things with them
6044227 nothing is going on at the moment the rumours are pure nonsense

6044235 i said maam do you want to trade them girls for a good fattening hog and then i went on into the meat department that was all that was said
6044236 it was a joke i was just being friendly having fun i meant nothing by it
6044237 im used to a big king size waterbed sleeping in a big fine house
6044238 i cant believe ive been in jail for so long for a very stupid thing i meant nothing by it

6044243 the punjabi dialogues songs and dances went against the film
6044244 ive heard that the punjabiyat and sikh theme have gone against the films success in bihar but i dont understand why we were aware that some areas would reject the films usp namely the sikh ambience surprisingly the film has done extremely well even in bengal where we thought the audience wouldve trouble connecting with the theme theres really no explanation for what has happened to singh is kinng in bihar
6044245 i am very excited about the show this is the first time that saif and i are performing together i have got a huge fan following in dubai because of
6044246 at this moment thaksins legal team is proceeding to ask for political asylum for thaksin and his family in britain

6044248 poland did very well to come back and played very well defensively bt we did well not to lose concentration
6044249 its brazil or china next on paper it would be better to have china but thats unlikely it will probably be brazil
6044250 i cant say that we managed to fully cope with the bulgarians especially kaziyski
6044251 in the first set we were just waking up but after that we managed to play collectively
6044252 as for bulgaria they can play one very good game in any tournament and i was praying before the game that it wouldnt be against us
6044253 ive suffered from episodes of cardiogenic syncope for the last 17 years or so but doctors ran a series of tests that came up inconclusive i hadnt had it happen for awhile until last december in italy when i passed out roughly about the time my father passed away back in the states the incident in virginia felt similar to what has happened in the past i have to thank my techs alan brian and good friend chief for catching me

6044274 if you have any doubts about this have a look and see how many worshippers there are look at the community theres so much been provided for muslims like schools
6044275 id like to think ive made some people pause reflect and reconsider ideas and assumptions they held as true but it would be naive to think that everyone who clicked on to the page now thinks differently
6044276 look different dress differently worship in a different way and live in the same community as them
6044277 we dont expect that a provider is going to know everything about every nationality
6044278 the critical thing here is developing sensitivity and the understanding that not every culture responds to medical providers in the same way sees medicine in the same way
6044279 from our peoples point of view were offending the doctors because theyre the experts as far as modern contemporary medicine
6044280 some doctors may think oh my goodness what happened to the babys butt
6044281 but the doctor understood thats just how asians are if the physician already knows about it if they are aware that certain races have certain characteristics then they dont have any doubts

6044285 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have cancelled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals

6044287 tensilica already provides best in class c and systemc based models of xtensa processors to customers who then integrate these processor models into larger virtual platforms
6044288 circuitsutra has the expertise to assist customers that are new to systemc in employing tensilica processor models and in creating models for the rest of their soc design we are pleased to have them as a new member of the xtensions network
6044289 we started working with tensilica because of great customer demand for their processor cores
6044290 as designers develop complex socs its important to model not just the processor but the entire chip we have extensive experience doing this and can be a valuable resource for tensilicas customers

6044295 le centre cest le compromis permanent donc la politique des petits pas
6044296 where members of the three monotheistic religions christians jews and muslims can all go to pray
6044297 i must be one heck of a writer to have produced a pornographic book without any sex scenes my book is as realistic a portrayal as i could muster of the prophet muhammads harem and his domestic life of course it has sexuality but there is no sex in my book
6044298 it was my hope that my book would be a bridge builder develop empathy for this other culture that we know so little about in this country
6044299 it has always rankled me the way history focuses on men and wars and mens politics and leaves women out i wanted to honour the women in muhammads life by giving them a voice
6044300 how many of you know someone from a different religion personally a jew or a muslim or a hindu
6044301 what does it mean to be a christian in a community country world of hindus muslims jews buddhists sikhs secular humanists etc
6044302 the religious life of mankind from now on if it is to be lived at all will be lived in a context of religious pluralism
6044303 my basic message is that muslims are no different from christians jews anyone
6044304 were human beings we should be treated just the same

6044311 i am definitely seeing more concerns clashes and discrimination lawsuits surrounding religious issues in the workplace
6044312 people are also becoming more comfortable expressing religion at work
6044313 businesses must find ways to handle religious conflicts while allowing room for employees spiritual needs
6044314 effectively handling religious differences not only requires specific attention but also creativity empathy and fairness
6044315 the emergence of religion as a workplace issue is driven by powerful demographics that are not going abate any time soon
6044316 condoleezza rice and colin powell were both black and they still invaded iraq
6044317 on the one hand you have muslims standing up for justice and due process and on the other hand you also see muslim women succeeding in the professional world leading the community in more ways than one
6044318 we are all open minded and respect each others beliefs
6044319 you may not be used to seeing it but this is what muslim women in america look like were educated and were professionals and were not an anomaly
6044320 british muslim students hold a diverse and broad range of opinions the majority of muslim students have tolerant ideas towards other minorities reject violence in the name of their faith and support britains secular and democratic society as well as its system of governance

6044325 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
6044326 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
6044327 if another member of the church sins against you go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone if the member listens to you you have regained that one but if you are not listened to take one or two others along with you so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses if the member refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church let such a one be to you as a gentile and a tax collector

6044342 yes he did but he gained them over a long period of time and they were all explained well in the storylines e g he drank the blood of the queen of them all the first of their kind the oldest of their kind etc hence i was able to accept his uber qualities give me a reason why someone can do this or that and ill be okay but just saying someone can do something just because hes this or that no thanks
6044343 my approach was to use heavy strings with a high action this leads to more resistance and a fatter sound my saxophone friends were using hard to play combinations my thicker sound was a by product of me slowing down so my hands wouldnt get ahead of my thoughts its basically my feeling that jazz is primarily 4 4 music based over a body of material that came to life in mid 20th century and the possibilities to make contributuions that are fairly limitless my purpose is to just refine my strengths which are really a nuanced sense of swing and a central thread holding this all together the time feel a combination of that with an individual voice
6044344 more of a lyrical interpretation tone and inflection have been important im thinking more along saxophone sounds and piano interpretations for instance i learned chords and melodies from eroll garner previously it was singers and instrumentalists

6044462 we believe that our recent work at china has added significantly to the potential value on this deposit the infill drilling has been very successful in confirming the overall grade and carbonate levels while also converting previously defined inferred resources into the measured and indicated categories the extensive metallurgical test work on the sulphides has allowed us to reclassify previously interpreted primary sulphide material into leachable material together these activities have resulted in a significant increase in chinas overall measured and indicated mineral resource our metallurgical test work has also demonstrated outstanding recoveries and a much lower acid consumption profile than that of the nearby franke deposit
6044463 we are currently evaluating various alternatives for bringing the china deposit into production given the current high price for sulphuric acid we are rapidly advancing an assessment of a potential scenario whereby an early china oxide starter pit is combined into the existing franke mine plan in order to significantly reduce our near term acid requirements our ability to do so will depend on a number of factors including the definition of a satisfactory china oxide starter pit ongoing metallurgical studies and an acceptable permitting timeline we will give further guidance as these activities progress resource evaluations continue in parallel on other areas of mineralization on the pelusa property china sur india and japan and we expect to be able to report on this activity during the fourth quarter

6044466 the russians are clearly not withdrawing in full as they promised
6044467 in fact there continue to be reports of them entering cities holding up ports refusing to let people move along highways asking for russian visas from people and so clearly the russian president has not kept his promise to abide by the terms of the ceasefire
6044468 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances

6044479 germany lost 4 1 and they are not the type of team that concedes many goals so i think the shock is a bit different from how we felt after losing to the americans
6044480 this is our last match and all we have to focus on and think about now of course we want a medal but whatever happens we want at the end of the match to feel like we did everything we could

6044503 it was wintertime id say it was around minus five i was cold with all my kit and i saw kids barefoot i will never forget that
6044504 someone has to be there they residents cant do it themselves and opposite to what everyone thinks people dont have the facts of why were there they think were there to kill and that we lose canadian soldiers just because were trying to take over afghanistan thats not it at all we are there to help their government take control of their country you need reconstruction and security for that
6044505 all i hear is the deaths you dont hear the good stories coming back i think thats why a lot of people dont know whats going on over there because all they see are coffins coming home
6044506 at the end of our tour we did a medical outreach we treated over 300 afghans families women and children were doing stuff like that all the time building schools and district centres

6044521 one weakness with previous systems is that you cant support large open spaces or large battlefields where there are a lot of people directly interacting with each other donnybrook which has been borne out of the collaboration with microsoft addresses a particular aspect of the game where you really want a large interacting body of people given todays communication bandwidth available to the typical home user as well as the update for these particular games we believe we can get to a typical realistically sized battle
6044522 first it reduces bandwidth demand by estimating what players are paying attention to thereby enabling it to reduce the frequency of sending less important state updates second it overcomes resource and interest heterogeneity by disseminating updates via a multicast system designed for the special requirements of games that they have multiple sources are latency sensitive and have frequent group membership changes

6044587 theres no great secret here if 60 cards are signed by employees you know theyre pro union theres no secret to it people who dont want it wont sign the card if youre on the fence you dont have to join the union these companies will stop at nothing to threaten and harass workers if businesses are worried about how their employees will vote in an election maybe they shouldnt trample on their freedoms
6044588 i found out what my rights as a worker are and i was shocked the right to work sounds good but it doesnt mean squat i have the right to quit and thats about it
6044589 longevity doesnt mean much at businesses anymore my son got a 27 cent an hour increase which is about 12 a week sure thats 12 more but with gas prices and food prices the way they are theres no way you can keep up
6044590 my first thought was that someone could care about the employees
6044591 now theyre fixing all the vehicles that were dangerous we were working 12 to 13 hours a day with no breaks but theyre trying to work with us on that now theyre listening to our complaints
6044592 i cant think of one good reason to oppose a union collective bargaining agreement benefits a highly trained and productive team
6044593 i can solve problems collectively rather than dealing with everyone individually its never hampered my business or ability to make a profit
6044594 contract wasnt fair enough im looking for the future of my family
6044595 i wanted to be on the line as much as possible and support my union brothers here in salina and in wichita
6044596 yes it hard no one wants to hire you for part time
6044597 my daughters teeth need to be pulled all the sudden we found out yesterday she has an abscess tooth so we need the money
6044598 i went out there not expecting anything and they said show up tomorrow morning 7 00
6044599 im really grateful to them its not about me its about my family
6044600 its gonna kill me i dont know what im gonna do
6044601 weve got to be sure that we dont shut the city down
6044602 that agreement was carried on the books of an affiliate citizens consulting inc cci as a loan to an officer
6044603 social entrepreneurs and leading nonprofit organizations that are assisting schools lifting families out of poverty filling health care gaps and inspiring others to lead change in their own communities
6044604 heads a secretive club called democracy alliance that has doled out 20 million to activist groups like acorn
6044605 the statement that mr franken wants to eliminate the secret ballot is not factually false
6044606 the ruling is a vindication of what the coalition for a democratic workplace has been saying all along that the employee free choice act represents a real threat to a workers right to cast a private vote on whether to unionize this is not only a victory for workplace privacy but for free speech as well
6044607 the dfl and its labor union allies cant hide from the facts and they cant prevent us from educating minnesotans about al frankens and norm colemans positions on the critical issue of worker privacy
6044608 the nlrb shall not direct an election but shall certify the individual or organization as the labor representative
6044609 the majority of small business owners dont know about this legislation and were here to help get the word out
6044610 eliminating the democratic process in the workplace is a serious violation of workers rights and a threat to their wages
6044611 if the employee free choice act passes being a right to work state wont matter anymore
6044612 if this act passes it will be like letting a kid loose in a candy store
6044613 this is critical and needs to be done in every chamber in north carolina and america
6044614 being against certain expansive labor and employment laws does not mean that youre against employees
6044615 its bad enough that employees who exercise their right to refrain from union membership are forced to pay fees to a union they do not want
6044616 but teamsters bosses are violating the law by compelling nonmembers to fund strikes and organizing activities which seek to corral even more workers into forced unionism
6044617 this exposes employees to coercion harassment and denies them the right to vote on a union contract
6044618 these decisions should be made in the voting booth surrounded by a curtain not in a parking lot surrounded by union bosses
6044619 this would add another pressure point when you have to sign a card in front of a union organizer
6044620 we cannot be a party that strips working americans of the right to a secret ballot election
6044621 we are the party that has always defended the rights of the working class to fail to ensure the right to vote free of intimidation and coercion from all sides would be a betrayal of what we have always championed
6044622 the legislation is called the employee free choice act and i am sad to say it runs counter to ideals that were once at the core of the labor movement instead of providing a voice for the unheard efca risks silencing those who would speak
6044623 come and see the man who told me everything i have ever done could he be the messiah
6044624 i have food to eat that you know nothing about
6044625 is to obey the will of the one who sent me and to finish the work he gave me to do 35 you have a saying four more months and then the harvest but i tell you take a good look at the fields the crops are now ripe and ready to be harvested 36 the one who reaps the harvest is being paid and gathers the crops for eternal life so the one who plants and the one who reaps will be glad together 37 for the saying is true someone plants someone else reaps 38 i have sent you to reap a harvest in a field where you did not work others worked there and you profit from their work
6044626 we believe now not because of what you said but because we ourselves have heard him and we know that he really is the savior of the world
6044627 a scroll flying through the air it is thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide
6044628 on it is written the curse that is to go out over the whole land on one side of the scroll it says that every thief will be removed from the land and on the other side it says that everyone who tells lies under oath will also be taken away 4 the l ord almighty says that he will send this curse out and it will enter the house of every thief and the house of everyone who tells lies under oath it will remain in their houses and leave them in ruins
6044629 it is a basket and it stands for the sin of the whole land
6044630 to babylonia where they will build a temple for it when the temple is finished the basket will be placed there to be worshiped
6044631 see i am doing a new thing now it springs up do you not perceive it i am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland

6044644 we havent given up on the whale but he does appear to be weaker than he was yesterday
6044645 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat
6044646 they suckle for 11 or 12 months so its a long time wed just agree itd be very difficult
6044647 we think it really needs to find its mother or foster mother and those are really the only chances
6044648 its easy to ignore 3 or 5 percent votes but its pretty hard to ignore 22 percent votes or 39 percent votes
6044649 that proposal was rejected by stockholders however the company elected to prepare a report simply because it had been a timely issue
6044650 the chairman thought it was the right thing to do at the time
6044651 it just doesnt seem to us that there is a whole lot of value to shareholders to do a study to tell them what they already know
6044652 fight to 53 about guys who are on the bubble of making the team and i already knew last week who i was going to do this week i had to tell marc dress so he could shoot isos isolated shots of the player and comcast gave me footage as well do you know what a melt is
6044653 next week im going to do a fight to 53 on this guy any shots youve got of him even if he doesnt make a play put them on that melt
6044654 my darkest moment was months ago trying to see if i had a future with this team
6044655 this is literally a childhood dream i felt deep in my soul it was meant for me to be here
6044656 i learned a lot about myself about my teammates about being a team player about what to say and what not to say about emotions
6044657 i feel better and stronger and more equipped to handle anything in my life
6044658 that gets me in touch with myself and reminds me of my father and my family and everything
6044659 with borrowing and debt on a clear upward trend and the economy set for a period of minimal growth and even contraction public finances look susceptible to further unscheduled borrowing

6044661 in america the red indians used to say the black people resembled buffalos because of their dreadlocks so buffalo soldier dreadlock rasta and the song is about them being stolen from africa brought to america fighting on arrival fighting for survival about 400 years ago
6044662 the other difference is in bar four where the final note goes down to an e in buffalo soldier but up to a c in banana splits in bar eight they both go down
6044663 then it would be a coincidence and coincidences do happen
6044664 it might be that bob marleys producer chris blackwell morphed mainstream sounds from the era into his music to make it more catchy there is no evidence of this its just a conspiracy theory
6044665 there was a watering down from the real authentic reggae which was more drum and basic to a more commercial style which would appeal to the masses
6044666 this really represents the cornerstone of what nbc wants to do outside the us
6044667 the uk is a huge market with a very large talent pool we will continue to grow our uk production business in comedy and non scripted i will sit down with gareth and see if there are other acquisitions and individuals we should target
6044668 i dont think we are done in the uk i suspect we will do more in the uk and we will want to expand the business
6044669 we are in the business of creating hits and successful programmes that travel
6044670 we are focused on uk broadcasters and what we can do for our us network and sister cable channels
6044671 what this deal does for us is create a truly unique production model it is a very difficult time to be a small or mid size production company
6044672 it struggles somewhat in the ratings for itv it would be unreasonable of me to say we achieved the ratings we hoped for in a very difficult slot in the summer

6044677 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat
6044678 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
6044679 the most likely outcome but we are not at that point yet
6044680 they also want to avoid a scenario where shes leading at any point
6044681 i slipped and broke my left ankle while i was on a walk with congresswoman
6044682 this holiday season may well be the perfect storm for airfare that sends travelers running for cover
6044683 the combination of high fuel prices airline capacity and route cuts means holiday travelers may easily spend upwards of 100 more per ticket than last year there are deals out there for both thanksgiving and christmas but theyre few and far between and wont last long
6044684 many airlines are adding additional fees such as baggage on top of these fares which can push the cost of travel higher
6044685 in 2007 travelers found the best holiday fares in the second week of october
6044686 this year is a whole new game so i recommend anyone who needs to fly on peak travel days to buy as soon as they find a reasonable fare those who do have flexibility in their travel dates should monitor fares closely over the next few months and look for fare drops
6044687 the intense media attention to high airfares has everyone thinking that travel this year is vastly more expensive than ever before and thats just not the case
6044688 for example lets look at an eight day trip for two to miami in september airfare has increased 109 since last year but hotels are 173 less expensive meaning the total trip cost is actually down 64
6044689 its certainly a big blow as grant has been a very significant player for us but he is remaining positive and his focus now is to support the group
6044690 were trying to maintain a role for him thats very close to the group
6044691 quite honestly its a tough market but the business did run well
6044692 its getting more difficult for us to grow our share as the decline becomes more prolonged

6044709 im sure many of you will not see this as important enough to repost
6044710 but if you love jesuss you will retype not copy but retype this message and send it too all your friends who found this interesting
6044711 any suggestions my versamail and web are working so i know the internet connections are right the link they direct me to is the link to download googlemaps
6044712 while there are a lot of things we can rehearse and plan other times we just need to be able to communicate effectively on our feet sometimes its easier said than done thats why i wanted to share information from joey ashers blog the following is a condensed version of the tips in joeys post ums
6044713 it just costs so much to raise a child nowadays
6044714 i do this because i feel its safer and healthier
6044715 if youre so secure in your choices how can my choices topple you so easily
6044716 its unclear what penalties the ama will seek to impose on women who choose to give birth at home either for religious cultural or financial reasons or just because they didnt make it to the hospital in time
6044717 what we do know however is that any state that enacts such a law will immediately find itself in court since a law dictating where a woman must give birth would be a clear violation of fundamental rights to privacy and other freedoms currently protected by the u s constitution
6044718 maternity care is a multi billion dollar industry in the united states
6044719 so its no surprise to see the ama join the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists in its ongoing fight to corner the market and ensure that the only midwives able to practice legally are hospital based midwives forced to practice under physician control i will say though that im shocked to learn that the ama is taking this turf battle to the next level by setting the stage for outlawing home birth itself a direct attack on those families who choose home birth who could be subject to criminal prosecution if the ama has its way
6044720 failed to provide ewg with reliable documentation of their alternative packaging and thus is not a clear improvement over other types
6044721 testing by ewg and by the fda indicates that under normal use liquid formula itself could expose an infant to substantially more bpa than a plastic bottle
6044722 breast milk is the best source of nutrition for babies
6044723 it contains essential fatty acids that help bolster babies bodies against the impacts of toxic chemicals
6044724 however there are many reasons why families rely on formula for some or all of their babys diet
6044725 formula should be manufactured in a way that avoids contamination with harmful chemicals
6044726 powdered formula sold by enfamil and similac are reduced risk choices because only the metal tops and bottoms of their packages not the cardboard sides are metal and lined with bpa based plastic
6044727 do you share those core values with your friends and colleagues
6044728 i dont think id realized quite how important it was to me until that moment
6044729 it represents the mothers connection to her baby and this rule fails to recognize the importance of what pumped milk represents forcing me to throw out the milk represents more than an inconvenience it devalues this connection between me and my baby
6044730 i was very upset it represented a lot of work and a lot of time and it was something that was very important for me to bring back to my baby
6044731 i expected to come home and have lots of milk for the rest of the week because i still have to work when i get home
6044732 i mean shes not going hungry or anything but we dont have any wiggle room
6044733 she would have been allowed to keep her one litre resealable bag and the containers of 100 millilitres or less in that one litre bag
6044734 joel and ian gold brothers and psychiatrists from montreal believe they have discovered a signature mental illness of the youtube era patients who claim they are subjects of their own reality tv shows

6044739 jessica is americas sweetheart and an internationally known entertainer who takes care of herself you can see it in her smile her skin her confidence and her obvious physical fitness
6044740 hoping to have the missing vp fix for the next patch also will be putting in a huge network optimization which should reduce lag tremendously and also improve connectivity significantly
6044741 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
6044742 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
6044743 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
6044744 what salty i dont even remember salt in the recipe
6044745 what were concerned about is the chance that someone might half consciously check the independent box and then vote the straight democratic party ballot and then have their votes voided
6044746 in america most people believe they are independent with a small i
6044747 that is going to confuse some people and cause a lot of votes to be lost
6044748 he was involved in collecting secret information on russian armed forces its combat readiness as well as data on other servicemen
6044749 its a waste of time because the process of the withdrawal of russian forces will continue
6044750 people stranded on the roofs of their houses are being rescued by boat rescue teams
6044751 ive made match play twice before but i had to go into a playoff both other times so this time i made it in without a playoff and that was nice
6044752 i played real well today and i putted real well
6044753 i made a lot of good putts and thats what i think helped
6044754 everything that chris was about was about making the world a better a place
6044755 he thought it was our job to make the world better for everybody and through that he saw radio as a conduit for expanding your mind and educating people giving them information they never got anywhere else
6044756 the production level was superior it was the most professional and best sounding product we had on our air i always felt like we were really lucky to have somebody of that caliber working at our station
6044757 he had been in radio in large award winning communities he was in new orleans jackson hattisburg and different places in arkansas
6044758 instead of selling out he decided to do other things
6044759 when i met him he was selling phones since then hes done many things he was a film maker video producer for everything from television commercials to educational seminars
6044760 the outpouring of support from people ive known my whole life to people ive never met before from the university community especially was amazing
6044761 he would just talk to the cashier at the grocery store for an hour and he was just really excited about the potential that ua had to teach young people about radio
6044762 it is another way for students to get involved on campus
6044763 studies have shown that students success rates skyrocketed when they became involved in campus organizations and activities
6044764 we have been doing a week of welcome for a few years now as a way to introduce the new students to popular activities on campus
6044765 capstone convocation is a more formal event geared towards new faculty as well as new students
6044766 it gives them the opportunity to hear what we believe in and what we are about as a university
6044767 it sounds like the university provides a lot of activities for new students to participate in
6044768 however it isnt the only opportunity students have to get involved in something they may be interested in
6044769 i already knew a lot of people here before i transferred so i didnt really have any trouble finding what i needed
6044770 but i guess if i didnt then i would probably try and go to these events to get to know other people and make new friends here
6044771 getting involved helps invest time wisely in something students enjoy
6044772 it also helps forge a connection with the university the important thing to remember is that it really isnt about quantity but quality students should find a few things they really enjoy and really dedicate their time to that
6044773 i wanted to come here to know more people to meet more friends
6044774 i know if i were an international student to come to a new country a new town i would want someone to welcome me
6044775 this is an event held by the office of international involvement and campus activities
6044776 the event and the offices goal is to get international students more involved with student organizations and get american students more involved with international students
6044777 have more transportation because we dont have a bike or a car
6044778 i live in rose towers and it is too far away from the places i have my courses
6044779 a lot of the international students stay in their own little cultural enclaves and dont necessarily get the full ua experience
6044780 lots of drinking and lots of dancing thats what i would expect
6044781 the only other place we really play is egans and were hoping for more than egans can hold
6044782 i loved it and it was party time all week long
6044783 i think the most creative thing we did on the first album was break a bottle on a microphone for this album we had so many options to work with in the studio
6044784 he was thrilled when he was able to help someone
6044785 not many people can say that everyone is their friend but matt honestly could
6044786 we averaged on our routine a good about 12 000 students per day
6044787 this year were only having a learning curve with the freshman and i think that is going to help tremendously
6044788 with the increase in fuel sure it is going to be a challenge but i think we can accomplish what we set out to do
6044789 no one wants to wait for the crimsonride in the rain
6044790 having the shelters in different places will make more students more likely to stick around and wait on the buses
6044791 once the starters are determined and there is still some competition in some of those positions then well determine that hey if these guys are back up players then were probably going to go ahead and play them on special teams
6044792 especially if they are at mid skill and skill positions which is where a lot of your special teams players come from
6044793 i dont feel like we have enough depth on our team if we dont play these guys they may make some mistakes early but i think in the long run it will make us a better team
6044794 each one of these guys have played the most significant role of any of the guys that have walked on our team
6044795 guys that become contributors on our team in any way shape or form we certainly like to put them on scholarships when scholarships are available we are happy and pleased to that we were able to reward these guys for their effort
6044796 i think anytime we do this its really a positive for a guy
6044797 we see him as one of the guys thats in the top 50 or 60 players on our team he wasnt quite working into the two deep and didnt have a role on defense this is strictly experimental because we think hes a good athlete and a good player that could contribute to the team in some place
6044798 its the same owners same coffee same people just a different name
6044799 its not meant to offend anyone and we hope it doesnt
6044800 we think weve found one thats going to work for us
6044801 the university of alabama seeks to maximize the number of students who can attend home football games at bryant denny stadium
6044802 because members of the million dollar band are already admitted to football games tickets ordered by these students are being reallocated to allow more students to attend
6044803 a combination of survey questions concerning the use of alcohol and drugs hours of study each day and the popularity of the greek system
6044804 do you like sitting next to a student who has a pistol in his backpack
6044805 guns put the power to kill literally at your fingertip
6044806 when im with you i want to listen to boyz ii men
6044807 we want this to be a way for students to connect with the community
6044808 it would be available for anyone to use and we hope would kindle an interest in nature in the community
6044809 its going to be a little bit different since its a different building
6044810 consistency in performance is probably the key to being successful i think our team last year probably didnt play with a lot of consistency in performance we didnt finish games we didnt finish the season we probably played one complete game and that was the tennessee game we were inconsistent up and down played up to the good teams down to the bad ones we were inconsistent within games had big leads and werent able to keep them i think those two things finishing and consistency in performance are probably the two things that were the biggest focal points for us in the off season to try to improve on
6044811 we have nine seniors on the team and even though we have good leadership in that group our improvement is going to depend on how our young players progress because we lack depth at several positions were fortunate to have a very good recruiting year but with a young team we must identify or establish an identity as a team these young players and how they respond to the challenges in the sec is certainly going to go a long way to determine how much success this team can have and how much this team will actually improve and we really wont know that until we get out there and play the games
6044812 we need to earn the respect we need to earn it so thats that we need to do thats what well work to do thats what were trying to do
6044813 julio jones has been everything i thought he was going to be its not often when a guy comes in on that high of pedestal from the end of high school and he comes in and hes as fast as i thought stronger that i thought i mean hes been everything that i thought hes got a lot of promise and potential and i look forward to him and star jackson looked great hes really got the concepts of what were trying to bring on the field
6044814 i havent felt this good about a group that came in in a long long time like seriously i hope that we can compete for the sec west this year but even if its not when im here i mean those guys that just came in are going to get it done because theres too much talent thats going to be on the field at one time not to be able to and coach sabans going to bring the same focus every year that he brings and those guys are going to get it done one way or another
6044815 im looking forward to the challenges of coaching in the sec conference i know the players and the coaches are the best in the country the fact that if you get to the championship game youre competing for the sec championship and then you have a chance to compete for the national championship is great and that is certainly what all of our goals are
6044816 as far as our football team goes the strength of our team starting out would be our offensive line and our defensive line thats where we have the most experience back thats where we have the most size and athletic ability and the skill of those young men to play their position
6044817 the whole situation the timing was bad theres no question about that if it could have played out any other way i would have loved to see it play out a different way but with the falcons and with arkansas it was really the only way that it could play out and im extremely happy to be the head football coach at the university of arkansas
6044818 its that time of year were excited i was really excited till i got up this morning you guys picked us to win the west you all are never right that puts me in a bind i dont know what im going to tell my team
6044819 tony franklin is a one direction guy he understands this offense hes worked with it hes tweaked it he knows how to practice it he knows how to recruit for it he knows how to game plan for it
6044820 the 08 is where were at were not defending were not dealing with rankings this is a brand new year if were defending come see the trophy its in our trophy case were not defending it its there we got a brand new team
6044821 i have great respect for the university of alabama the history they have presented to college football the competition that they put on every time they take the field i promise you that any fun and entertainment that i have with supporters is very respectful
6044822 my whole problem is you have a group of guys again that had very little success the last three four years and they havent experienced a bowl game they didnt experience winning an sec game last year so those are the obstacles that were trying to really work hard with
6044823 we want to win we want to win right now i think it would be unfair to say okay were going to rebuild just kind of gradually i think its unfair for your seniors
6044824 i think we have a chance to do that this year i dont know if were good enough but i know this every year prior to now we have played as good as we could play when i sit back and look at our team we have played as good as we can play but our goal is to win the conference championship
6044825 this is the southeastern conference theyre going to be close the blowouts back when i was playing in alabama the game over at halftime 35 to nothing you sit over there and drink water eat popcorn the rest of the game those days are over games are going to be decided probably by seven points or less and its going to come down to somebody doing something right or wrong at the end of the game thats just the way it is
6044826 we have a very good team coming back however the way im breaking this thing down and im sharing with our team youre going to read this quite often so our teams going to hear it quite often seven wins comes from talent you start mixing in a little discipline up to eight or nine wins somehow if you can develop a little leadership on your team not necessarily seniors but leadership to get you off the field on fourth down defense make a big play at the end of the game to win thats when you start having great things happen for your program
6044827 i think well be much more mature as far as preparing every week this year and getting ready for every team we play i think our leaders will be much better this year at really helping the young guys evolve and get ready to focus week in and week out every team we play
6044828 i think it will be a very big game to say the least it could be a top few teams in the country playing that game with the right to play in the sec maybe national championship for the winner of that game they got a great team theyre coached very well theyre a huge rival of ours i think that increased that much more this past year thats just going to i think fire us up that much more
6044829 our goal is always set to win the eastern division our goal is always set to try to win the southeastern conference from that point you dont know if youll get in the national championship game or not quite frankly its hard to set a goal that you cant control
6044830 defensively we should be the best defensive team that ive had at kentucky our defensive front is outstanding our secondary our linebackers we have depth competition and experience
6044831 we were one of the teams that everybody used to think they could put an automatic w up next to as they went into the season its not that way anymore
6044832 offensively we got a new quarterback tommy beecher tommy has been there all three years he was one of our first guys we signed the first year i got there hadnt played much yet but hes ready
6044833 im excited about this team and about getting back to work and seeing where we can go with this team id a lot rather be playing for the sec championship in december than to be picked first in july in birmingham so well see if we can make that happen
6044834 as i said to all the other groups this is not the place for that kind of thing there are great fans that have great passion about the southeastern conference that are not interested in that kind of bs and i would have some other choice words if there werent so many cameras in here
6044835 if he stays healthy and continues on the path that hes on hell certainly be one of the best players that tennessee has had in a long time and one of the best players that has played in the country in a long time
6044836 the thing is our coaching staff has invested a lot into this program theyve worked extremely hard we want to see it be successful were hoping we can get it done i think we made strides towards that i think we were extremely close last year a couple games go either way were in a bowl we think its always going to be tough because were in the sec and the teams we have to play but were also confident that we can compete with anybody on our schedule
6044837 georgia why is russia in georgia id better call my sister in atlanta to see whats going on hell maybe i ought to get down there
6044838 not that georgia the country of georgia thats near russia
6044839 i knew that i just wanted to see if you fools knew it

6044850 life is like a bicycle to keep your balance you must keep on moving
6044851 i have an m d from harvard i am board certified in cardiothoracic medicine and trauma surgery i have been awarded citations from seven different medical boards in new england and i am never ever sick at sea so i ask you when someone goes into that chapel and they fall on their knees and they pray to god that their wife doesnt miscarry or that their daughter doesnt bleed to death or that their mother doesnt suffer acute neural trauma from postoperative shock who do you think theyre praying to now go ahead and read your bible dennis and you go to your church and with any luck you might win the annual raffle but if youre looking for god he was in operating room number two on november seventeenth and he doesnt like to be second guessed you ask me if i have a god complex let me tell you something i am god

6044864 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters

6044867 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6044935 if you are not a christian you are going to hell
6044936 i tell you the truth no one can enter the kingdom of god unless he is born of water and the spirit
6044937 does not mean your are going to hell if you are not catholic it means basically that salvation is possible only through jesus and his one holy catholic and apostolic church even if
6044938 in this one and only church of god from its very beginnings there arose certain rifts which the apostle strongly censures as damnable

6044946 but if every one of us can be called special doesnt that make us all the same
6044947 baby have you been watching springer instead of animal planet
6044948 but you figured out how to change the channel and watch something else
6044949 well yes all that one has to do to change the channel is stomp on the remote control and you must admit that we have three very good stomper cats in our house
6044950 that is very true we do have three very good stomper cats in our house
6044951 remember that time we watched that show that had those aspca people rescuing abused animals
6044952 yes i member you were crying and i was crying and ozma and ariel were trying to turn the tv off the rating was pg but it wasnt rated right and we all got very sad
6044953 do you remember that there are other cats outside we saw those on animal planet
6044954 yes some cats and many dogs live outside they cannot come inside it would be very bad if we let them inside our house there might be biting
6044955 there are more cats in this world than just you and ozma and ariel if i could take care of all of them kali i would but i cant i can only take care of three cats
6044956 i dont know why people do that maybe their owners meant well when they took them in but somehow lost the ability to care for their pets and rather than help their pet find a good home they kept the pet hoping their home would get good again many pets are treated very well
6044957 so why us why did we get lucky why did we get you and not be on tv
6044958 i dont know sweetie it is something i cannot explain to you but i can tell you that when i say that you are special i mean that you are special to me when i built my life and i took ariel and ozma i asked for them when julias mother decided to help your mother have kittens she asked for you and when i brought you home i chose you
6044959 but that doesnt make me special to anyone other than you
6044960 sweetheart those other people dont really matter yes what people think of us is important but when you get down to the real substance of living those people dont really count what counts is who you love and who loves you all creatures die in the absence of someone caring about them thats the thing that makes you special that and a supreme fighting style combined with a very cool red spot on your head and a nose that has three colors

6044964 do you see what i see question of the day
6044965 stop making up problems just to justify your inability to fit into our society
6044966 have you ever stopped to think about how many portable electronic devices you use the topic probably doesnt come up until you head out on a business trip or vacation thats when you spend equal amounts of time packing clothes and your gadgets lets see centro canon sureshot digital camera ipod regular cellphone bluetooth headset and maybe if you are really needing more than email and basic web access a portable computer now do the math thats six types of charging devices or put another way thats six devices needing charging okay so lets fast forward to your final destination you enter your hotel room and the outlet hunt is on seems like a lot of hotel rooms were built in the day where youd have maybe one or two devices max and grounded outlets 3 prong were reserved for the bathroom yikes lets look at a different scenario what if you are renting a beach house you could run into a similar problem regarding grounded outlets with the kitchen becoming a possible alternative to the bathroom

6045239 at this moment in time i would say that i have recovered 95 from my fall at knockhill but i will be back to full fitness in time for first practice on saturday
6045240 i really love the cadwell park circuit and as always my sole intention for going as quickly as i possibly can around there will be to get back to the mountain i cant go over it enough i know that i gave the airwaves ducati team a lot of work to do after knockhill so i want to repay them here this weekend with some results to really celebrate about
6045241 to set up a new team in the extremely competitive british f3 championship takes real guts and resolve

6045252 todos sabem que os dois jogos seguidos que temos em casa ser o decisivos para definir nosso futuro no campeonato
6045253 the positive sentiment has been created by a weaker euro and a drop in the oil price sappi and holmen announced capacity shutdowns last week and that has also boosted the shares
6045254 upm is a strong buy i am most positive on upm because of their asset structure they own forests and very good energy assets and pulp producer metsa botnia shares so thats a good thing behind the papermaking
6045255 scas valuation is also quite low at the moment price to book is very attractive
6045256 we definitely need more consolidation and capacity closures something will have to be done this autumn
6045257 there are still big uncertainties to tackle theres a connection between gdp growth and demand for paper grades now that the macroeconomic picture has become more uncertain that weighs on the negative side but the realization that the european economies are doing weaker than expected has started to boost the dollar against the euro and that is positive for european papermakers and the shares have reacted to that
6045258 if the dollar continues to strengthen that will help every cent helps
6045259 the more bearish view is that economic slowdown will leave this sector under pressure also this year im a little more on the macro driven cautious side
6045260 overall factors at the moment are more favourable than a half year ago
6045261 the whole industry has experienced enormous cost inflation in the last three years but now the dollar is strengthening and that is bringing the oil price down which is absolutely good news for norske skog and other european companies

6045276 franks portrait of the conservative movement however sacrifices complexity to caricature
6045277 instead of carefully dissecting the many failures and missteps of the bush administration from its handling of the iraq war to hurricane katrina and its penchant for favoring political loyalty over expertise mr frank tries to extrapolate its many stumbles into an object lesson about the wickedness of conservative governments in general

6045279 beginning in the 1970s the cheap beer that had long been synonymous with the blue collar heartland began a steep decline with sales by 2001 dipping to fewer than a million barrels a year 90 percent below the beers peak but in 2002 pabst noticed a sudden sales spike driven by an unlikely demographic countercultural types bike messengers skaters and their tattooed kin in hipster redoubts like portland ore had taken to swilling the stuff when asked why they would praise pabst for its non image for the fact that it seemed to care little about selling
6045280 pabsts campaign was designed to push beer without appearing to push it to the extent that it conveyed any branding message at all it was hey we dont care if you drink the stuff
6045281 pabst blue ribbons anti capitalist ethos is as walker puts it a sham the company long ago closed its milwaukee brewery and now outsources its operations to miller its entire corporate staff is devoted to marketing and sales not brewing you really couldnt do much worse in picking a symbol of resistance to phony branding walker writes but pbrs fans dont care in the new era of marketing image is everything
6045282 twenty fragments of a ravenous youth by xiaolu guo is a little novel less than 180 pages

6045284 but twenty fragments resembles a chekhov story in containing under its brief chatty surface an enormous world here is modern china struggling to belong to the 21st century while still tied to fascism and communism and here is a universal story of a young woman figuring out who she is and deciding despite the machinations of bad boyfriends and noisy neighbors what she really wants
6045285 some folks read travel books to get a sense of a place before they go others hope to learn about foreign lands theyd love to visit but fear they will never see i read troost because hes willing to navigate his way around countries that hold little or no appeal for me as travel destinations there is almost nowhere on this earth for example that i have less desire to visit than china now thanks to troosts hilarious and cutting narrative i dont have to and if thats not worth 22 95 i dont know what is
6045286 weve seen these isolated reports about people having connectivity issues with 3g and edge and frankly i have those issues on a variety of phones
6045287 we have already made many improvements to mobileme but we still have many more to make
6045288 we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour
6045289 i heard yesterday thursday that martin was on the transfer list and told robbie if he was available we would be interested but we would have to look at the price
6045290 i spoke to robbie again and we now have permission to speak to martin he charlesworth has said he is listening to all his options and has had a few teams interested
6045291 the chairman was away so i will talk to him tonight but it will come down to what fee elgin are looking for as we cannot compete in the 10 000 bracket he is a proven scorer who is quick and knows where the goals are he is very direct when he gets sight of the net
6045292 i will look to talk to martin again face to face this time and tell him our thoughts on why he should join forres mechanics
6045293 he has also worked with a number of our players in the past so hopefully that will also help you have always got to look at players like martin charlesworth because he is the kind of player you need if you want to improve and that is our aim
6045294 and aim to make it a priority to meet with individuals to discuss any community concerns that they have i would encourage members of the public to get in touch with me at the forres police office or in person when they see me in the area on foot or cycling
6045295 i will be based in the forres police office as there is no suitable accommodation in either kinloss or findhorn
6045296 anyone wishing to speak to me can reach me there however i would emphasise for emergencies they should call the service centre or 999 as i wont be in the forres office all the time
6045297 i will be able to switch either days or nights to allow me to fit in with community issues
6045298 it would not only be community council meetings i want to get involved with any community group who want me to attend i think it is very important that i do that as it will allow me to build up contacts and trust with the various parts of the community
6045299 hopefully once we get to know each other ill be able to pop in there any time i can and get involved in school events

6045306 profundamente religioso acredito que seja um percentual relativamente pequeno n s temos uma mocidade esp rita bem atuante mas mesmo assim n o profundamente religiosa ela freq enta algumas atividades de final de semana mas profundamente religioso seria aquele que estivesse em contato quase a todo momento com a religi o ou com trabalhos assistenciais que os esp ritas desenvolvem

6045322 the fixed income markets are starting to lose faith miller said
6045323 typically when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy individuals to determine cognitive impairment
6045324 however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
6045325 we know that level of performance on tests of memory attention and executive function predicts dementia however this study showed for the first time that the degree of variability in performance across neuropsychological tests measured within a person improved the prediction of dementia above and beyond ones level of performance on each test alone
6045326 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period which on average was 3 3 years
6045327 this figure is in line with what wed expect for the incidence of dementia in this population
6045328 we are honoured that such a prestigious and reputable society as the esa has chosen to partner with lww
6045329 lww already publishes many of the leading textbooks and journals in anaesthesiology and we look forward to working with the esa so that together we can expand our international content offerings in this important field

6045331 theres more of a tendency to invade the central nervous system and infect neurons and brain stem regions within the individual
6045332 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
6045333 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
6045334 appropriate nondiscriminatory treatment to all transgender and gender variant individuals
6045335 this trend underscores the need for psychologists to acquire greater knowledge and competence in addressing transgender issues
6045336 psychologists who work with clients with gender identity issues are not of one mind on this issue
6045337 accordingly if there were evidence showing the gid diagnosis to be similarly harmful and discriminatory against gender variant transgender or transsexual people there would be a precedent for a resolution discouraging psychologists from using this diagnosis

6045340 i had a race plan but it went out the window i was in my own world people said did you know sanya had gone off very hard but she was in lane seven and i couldnt see her
6045341 all i had to work off was the russian girl outside me who i knew would go off very hard and at 200m i was annoyed with myself that i had left myself too much work
6045342 i dont really care what people think or say they can say what they like
6045343 no why should it be spoiled im very happy with what ive done
6045344 she seemed ok as she got off the plane but as she was walking through the terminal she just broke down she seemed really upset
6045345 if you want to be unhappy think only of yourself if you want to be happy think only of others
6045346 while global temperatures show an upward trend since 1860 dimming and cooling started to outweigh the effects of global warming in the late 1940 s then starting in 1970 with the clean air act in the united states and similar policies in europe atmospheric sulfate aerosols declined significantly the epa reports that in the u s alone from 1970 to 2005 total emissions of the six principal air pollutants including pm s dropped by 53 percent in 1975 the masked effects of trapped greenhouse gases finally started to emerge and have dominated ever since
6045347 according to new calculations the impacts of methane on climate warming may be double the standard amount attributed to the gas the new interpretations reveal methane emissions may account for a third of the climate warming from well mixed greenhouse gases between the 1750s and today the ipcc report which calculates methanes affects once it exists in the atmosphere states that methane increases in our atmosphere account for only about one sixth of the total effect of well mixed greenhouse gases on warming
6045348 non radiative climate forcings than policy actions that focus on co2 make good sense
6045349 radiative forcing of climate change expanding the concept and addressing uncertainties
6045350 a recent comprehensive united nations environmental program unep report released on august 12 2002 indicates that a 2 mile thick toxic umbrella dubbed the
6045351 variations in solar luminosity and their effect on the earths climate
6045352 but does the specific percentage attribution really imply much for the future i e does it matter that co2 forced 40 or 80 of 20th century change
6045353 but isnt the evidence clear that we are currently experiencing an unprecedented level of temperature increase and that has risen in line with co2
6045354 but does the specific percentage attribution really imply much for the future i e does it matter that co2 forced 40 or 80 of 20th century change
6045355 it is true that heat could be going elsewhere i e melting ice deep ocean heating but most of these would actually suppress a warming signature it is hence plausable that the equlibrium response of the planet to the forcings already present is higher than the observed temperature increase
6045356 each one is specified as independently as possible with uncertainties of course and run through the model
6045357 if you throw it all in together it does a good job for the 20th century
6045358 we cant arbitrarily scale them to get your preferred response that would indeed be pointless
6045359 moreover our estimate of 0 27 c mean surface warming per century due to land use changes is at least twice as high as previous estimates based on urbanization alone7 8

6045361 geologic co2 sequestration predicting and confirming performance in oil reservoirs and saline aquifers
6045362 bp and edison plan california power plant with co2 sequestration
6045363 lcg february 15 2006 edison mission group emg a subsidiary of edison international and bp recently announced plans to build a hydrogen fueled power plant in southern california that would generate electricity from petroleum coke with minimal carbon dioxide co2 emissions
6045364 successful sequestration project could mean more oil and less carbon dioxide emissions
6045365 while there are numerous large commercial co2 enhanced oil recovery operations around the world none of these has undertaken the depth and extent of research that we have
6045366 storage capacities quoted are based on injection costs of up to 20 us per tonne of co2 stored
6045367 in a breakthrough study published today in the online edition of science scientists explain why aerosols tiny particles suspended in air pollution and smoke sometimes stop clouds from forming and in other cases increase cloud cover
6045368 this is very important site cause it helps one to understand what the word

6045371 another series of ccsm3 experiments is underway which will provide data for an upcoming ipcc assessment report data from these experiments will be made available after ccsm3 results are submitted to the ipcc

6045373 empirical evidence for a nonlinear effect of galactic cosmic rays on clouds
6045374 the mixing ratio of a gas is numerically equal to the pressure exerted by the gas denoted for co2 as pco2 in 2005 as i write this the pco2 of the atmosphere is reaching 380 atm
6045375 had it not been for this reduction in methane emissions from wetlands atmospheric levels of methane would most likely have continued rising
6045376 this suggests that if the drying trend is reversed and emissions from wetlands return to normal atmospheric methane levels may increase again worsening the problem of climate change
6045377 the emissions that caused this past episode of global warming probably lasted 10 000 years by burning fossil fuels we are likely to emit the same amount over the next three centuries
6045378 what is causing the drop in co2 as the earth cools from the interglacial warm period to the glacial coldest period
6045379 do the models take into account gas law deviations and other non linearities
6045380 some currently unknown process causes antarctica and the surrounding ocean to warm this process also causes co2 to start rising about 800 years later
6045381 the national weather service reported that 9 inches of rain had fallen
6045382 within a half hour there were chunks of ice i can only assume from exit glacier flowing down exit glacier road
6045383 i have written on the impacts of climate change upon day to day weather patterns in these pages during the past year and will have more comment on this one when i have the time was going to allude to this aspect in my entry last night but couldnt have quickly done it justice
6045384 tom dang of the national weather service said the low pressure system that caused the storm moved in on the jet stream from the aleutian islands pulling in tropical moisture that had welled there
6045385 within a half hour there were chunks of ice i can only assume from exit glacier flowing down exit glacier road
6045386 floods pound highway waterfalls on tuesday wash over the richardson highway running through keystone canyon north of valdez floodwaters severely damaged a stretch of the highway closing the road and blocking valdez from the rest of alaska
6045387 lake superior s water level is currently 11 inches lower than it was a year ago while lake michigan huron is 1 inch below last year
6045388 there is now stronger evidence than ever of human induced climate change
6045389 our climate is expected to continue to become warmer this will result in significant reductions in lake level exposing new shorelines and creating tremendous opportunities for large scale restoration of highly valued habitats
6045390 we can try to be positive about climate change really positive
6045391 if it continues to be hot once you lose that meter of water over the top we get an entirely natural new shoreline along a lot of the lakefront if we manage it right things could look a lot like they did when the first white settlers arrived
6045392 there is a lot of opinion among scientists who study the great lakes that we need to get the public to start thinking what are things going to look like
6045393 further you give a forcing of 0 15 w m 2 to land use changes is this number simply a basic surface albedo difference forcing which does not include feedbacks such as increased cloud cover over vegetated land or increased biochemical production as opposed to sensible heat production by biomass is a precision of two significant figures appropriate
6045394 co2 levels appear to have risen steadily only since the 1920s
6045395 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
6045396 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
6045397 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
6045398 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
6045399 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
6045400 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
6045401 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
6045402 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
6045403 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
6045404 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy
6045405 which ensures that the device can only be read when the owner is pressing the switch
6045406 software application testing is an incredibly dynamic field and we are seeing significant changes and advances regularly
6045407 utests model could very well be indicative of where the future of software testing services are headed
6045408 with pressures surrounding faster time to market customer control of testing environments and rapidly remediating application defects it makes sense to provide a saas based on demand model to effectively address these concerns
6045409 there are around 75 000 professional testers worldwide and we are honoured that around 10 to date have joined our community
6045410 we are distraught at the thought that any consumer or customer of ours would have been in any way harmed
6045411 we are taking all the steps we possibly can to re establish that confidence the 500 people employed at the plant will not be laid off

6045414 we have crews engaged to deliver supplies to those in need and others on standby ready to go at a moments notice if called upon to go in and provide relief
6045415 weve been called on to provide relief before air mobility is a unique asset for our nation
6045416 our airlift capability also allowed our nation to keep its promise to georgia
6045417 when georgia needed its troops at home we were able to quickly provide the lift to get them there

6045420 over the last two seasons we have got off to a poor start then after five or six games weve picked up again
6045421 but this year weve done one or two things differently over the summer
6045422 everything is geared up towards the players and trying to make us improve as a team were all in it together and ive got a good squad now at the club
6045423 its hard for me as the manager because i have good players who cant even get on the bench but thats for me to worry about
6045424 the objective of this exercise is to bring our unique abilities together in a common cause defense of the panama canal and the region
6045425 the importance of the panama canal to the worlds economy and the stability enjoyed by the region make them both attractive targets to those who would do harm to either
6045426 the protection of the canal and maintaining stability in the region is truly a worthy goal and one whose achievement benefits all
6045427 lt sterett was born in baltimore in 1778 and it is fantastic to be in a town with such great nautical history
6045428 he was a brave naval hero at a time when the navy was a fledgling force he is an incredible individual and we welcome his spirit on board
6045429 i never thought id get to come to maryland on board my ship and see my local maryland citizens
6045430 we wanted to become part of cg 31 and carry on the tradition of the sailors who cruised before us
6045431 this commissioning flag was from the vietnam era ships ceremony
6045432 normally the flag is supposed to go the commanding officer but the signalman who raised it kept it
6045433 he said he would be honored if we flew his flag
6045434 there is a great line of history here and this is just another artifact of that history
6045435 to know that another quartermaster or signalman raised this flag up many years ago is very exciting to me
6045436 being so new to the navy its an honor to be a plank owner many years from now i can say i was here when the ship was commissioned i could also say when i was 20 i raised the commissioning flag
6045437 we have a stronger hull as well as improved isolation systems
6045438 this makes it easier to isolate chill water firemains or anything else we need to shut off
6045439 we can use circuit boards and software that are industry standards today
6045440 it keeps us modern and more sophisticated it also allows us to bring the latest and greatest technology to the navy

6045443 at the end of the day the role of the department of education is limited we need the districts to do the job
6045444 the regents will continue to focus on high school reform
6045445 our final goal is to have all students in all schools reach proficiency
6045446 there is no magic pill and we continue to very cautiously look at data
6045447 but we did a curriculum revision prompted by the fact that a segment of our population was not getting the courses they needed to prepare for the test

6045454 o naturalismo como fundamento tico desastroso para a sociedade a m dio e a longo prazo e por isso bom que o presidente da rep blica chame a aten o do parlamento para que reveja alguns dos crit rios para que os dois c njuges sejam respeitados nas suas decis es e que os filhos sejam um elemento a ter em conta nas decis es pessoais

6045484 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6045485 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6045486 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6045487 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6045488 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6045489 mccain views this as the one decision that he has total utter nonnegotiable control over
6045490 im so thankful to god that there is going to be a dollar store in centerville i have prayed for this for at least two years

6045492 the ranking sorts by the number of gold medals earned by a country in this context a country is an entity represented by a national olympic committee the number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals if after the above countries are still tied equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically

6045495 it should not make us forget the stakes in this conflict that are as high for europe as they are for the united states
6045496 if the aims are just are the tactics being used to achieve them correct
6045497 is not a lot in an immense country with poor communications experience has shown however that it is difficult to do more
6045498 negotiations to exploit divisions in the rebel factions that are controlling the south of the country
6045499 what is regrettable is that these decisions were made without national debate almost on the sly
6045500 they were not well received by public opinion which saw in them an alignment with washington and also a futile threat to soldiers lives not without reason as the ambush has demonstrated
6045501 we should ask ourselves whether this force is uncovering the violence or creating it
6045502 they seem to be paying a forfeit to their great american ally for not participating in the iraqi adventure

6045509 they have agreed to extend the due date for charges related to the damaged boxes until nov 15 which does allow the insurance companies for these residents time to process the claim and provide residents with funds for which to pay that due
6045510 we dont regret the eoc activation were quite relieved that it fizzled out
6045511 it was a great tune up for the county if citizens had concerns they dont need to have them

6045522 you dont have any idea what it means to them to be able to contest a final these guys heart and soul is in it and i knew that i had a special bunch when i went down there all these guys want is a chance of winning the liam mccarthy and they have it
6045523 i have the medal and im holding it but its so surreal its a blessing its going to hit me maybe in the morning and im going to cry thanking god
6045524 he was just looking out to see what was going on when they opened fire and he was hit three times there was no reason for this he wasnt doing anything
6045525 they looted the main shop and then started shooting people
6045526 he had gone to see if he could find any food it was a risky thing to do maybe he shouldnt have gone out but he had to feed his family they killed him because he was a georgian and a young man
6045527 they came in two cars usually a military jeep at the front and a minibus at the back its usually young guys in their early 20s they behave like theyre on a hunting trip

6045530 the russians invaded so they have to take responsibility for what happened on occupied territory this is another srebrenica
6045531 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6045532 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6045533 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
6045534 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6045535 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6045536 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6045537 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up

6045540 we as members of the public are the ones who buy these products from the street corners while ignoring the genuine ones in the shop next door thus encouraging the pirates that there is a market out there for their products but the question remains who are we hurting at the end
6045541 seeing that our books have not been audited for the past three years we could not detect that she had given herself the increase we also found that certain companies in the town were not paying rates and taxes while 42 votes were overspent without council approval by around n 500 000
6045542 if the records are clean it will be back to normal however if there are irregularities that warrant further steps we will take them it must be clear that the suspension is not a punitive action it is just to freely collect the information
6045543 we need to ask ourselves whether we are qualified to be called councillors

6045555 it was the most impressive athletics performance ive ever seen in my life
6045556 i certainly expected him to win i cant say i expected him to win that fast or separate himself from the field so much
6045557 the fact he could have run even faster shows how great it was it was an incredible performance
6045558 he has incredible speed and an incredibly long stride that affords him the ability to cover more ground with every stride the way no one else can
6045559 its unfortunate what has happened in the sport its being addressed
6045560 fans are going to make up their own minds if they believe the only way he can do that is doping they will believe that
6045561 im giving you another reason why he could do that
6045562 when you see somebody do something that physiologically no one else has been able to do you are going to see some amazing times thats the explanation i have for that
6045563 he has been working on his start and the first part of the 100m proved he has worked on that hes going to have to turn the corner a lot better and run the corner better
6045564 he is an incredible athlete he would be a world class 400m runner near 43 seconds
6045565 whether he could run under the world record that would be uncertain because some other elements come into play endurance and strength
6045566 it will be a great race jeremy is going to win but it will be a great race
6045567 merritts strength is the fact hes very fast he has to have a strategy that takes that into account
6045568 jeremy is not as fast but the key is he has speed endurance other athletes cant match once he gets that speed pace he can run that speed all race long thats his weapon that takes a different strategy than someone who has superior speed
6045569 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks in short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue
6045570 yesterday they said they had no problem with parliament opening and today they have a problem i have no comment on that
6045571 all inquiries regarding the conduct of officers and staff were investigated
6045572 the conduct of members of the police service whether on or off duty affects public confidence and the public have the right to expect the highest standards from their police service at all times
6045573 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6045574 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6045575 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
6045576 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
6045577 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
6045578 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
6045579 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
6045580 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
6045581 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
6045582 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
6045583 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
6045584 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
6045585 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent
6045586 we just believe that its time for us to look at other options for our kids as opposed to corporal punishment
6045587 we think theres more effective ways most of our principals have chosen not to use it even though its been in the book were trying to create some consistency
6045588 with this latest update to its licensing rules microsoft is knocking down barriers to virtualised deployments which should help further accelerate the adoption rates

6045624 now go back to making your movies about women who love to handle big guns that shoot hundreds of people to death
6045625 it will help both the nato alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6045626 missile defense of course is aimed at no one it is in our defense that we do this
6045627 missile defenses including an interceptor base in poland provide a necessary and critical capability that can be used to defend both nations and other nato allies from long range missile threats
6045628 which provides that an armed attack against one nato country shall be considered an armed attack against them all
6045629 the negotiations have sometimes been tough but they have never been unfriendly
6045630 they have sometimes been difficult but they have always been purposeful
6045631 i can tell you that generally ratings are higher than for any olympic games before
6045632 in the aftermath of the salt lake city problems i dont use the word scandal anymore we were able to clean house
6045633 she hit her spots really well and she capitalized on the fact that we were trying so hard
6045634 its more like that internal want if thats the right way to describe it youre so close to getting to that game that you want to be in you want that win and youre that close you could just feel us want it want it and want it
6045635 i felt like i was doing the home run trot around the bases when bustos gets a hold of one you know its out it was a great kind of exclamation point on the day
6045636 like i was telling coach you dont even feel it hit the bat you just feel the motions before it but you dont feel it you just see it
6045637 you watch michael phelps kick butt in the swimming pool and you watch our basketball team dominate
6045638 i would hope the ioc wants the olympics to be about giving everything you possibly have and if you happen to win by a lot thats what makes the olympics so beautiful
6045639 as much as a close game like this is fun to watch i think its the sport itself that should remain
6045640 we came here prepared for the 20 inning game the 16 inning game the 14 inning game and the five inning game
6045641 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6045642 given the sensitivities that have developed around this matter a court would not like any party to be uncomfortable
6045643 the zuma cases have nothing to do with the issues which are before your lordships today
6045644 i am here only at the request of the court i have no interest in this case
6045645 theyll see us as a different proposition than the all blacks and theyll identify some things that they think will work for them ive got no idea what they are but they will have some plans for sure
6045646 in the present case the mdc has not consented to the convening of the parliament
6045647 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the mou and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks
6045648 by stepping in at this stage are you not usurping the functions of parliament
6045649 is acting for private sectional interests and that it may not do
6045650 they are carrying out narrow sectional interests of a party not of the public
6045651 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace

6045658 let me tell you something about the columbus egg and quickpwn
6045659 weve had a few participants come forward and wish to participate in the program weve had numerous phone calls and traffic to our web site as well
6045660 what were immigration officials smoking when they came up with that idea
6045661 heres somebody an immigrant who spent thousands of dollars going through a horrible trek through the desert and jeopardizing their own life just to get here and here they think theyre just going to go home because we said they can they didnt ask for our permission to come why would they ask for our permission to go home
6045662 was designed so we could give individuals the opportunity to comply with the law and to remain out of custody to make arrangement for themselves and their families
6045663 we didnt achieve what we set out for and that was the leadership of the city of kankakee
6045664 no one is very excited about nickey yates for him to go door to door i dont see people getting excited i believe the 2005 vote total are misleading
6045665 i believe at that time people wanted to see a change and nickey was the benefactor of that i believe hes misreading his popularity
6045666 don st germaine is irrelevant to me im not going to get into a squabble with him
6045667 ive got nothing to talk to them about his blessing doesnt matter this is about me not him
6045668 there are some good things taking place in this city i certainly think though that there are some things that can be tweaked
6045669 every now and again you need to shuffle the deck you need fresh ideas after a while its time for fresh new ideas
6045670 the change will not affect existing customers and new customers can still claim 12 months backdating if they apply before october 6 the changes are part of a wider package of measures to make claiming benefits simpler and more automatic and increase take up
6045671 i think on balance this represents a good package it is a trade off that is worth having
6045672 where is bethlehem why was samuel sent there tell about samuels visit to the house of jesse
6045673 the lord was his shepherd he leadeth him beside the still waters he restoreth his soul
6045674 as the hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee o god
6045675 while we focus squarely on the sparkling economic giant the cultural superstar and regional superpower in the dark margins of our spectacular new india our problems continue to fester and spill over
6045676 even god will not be able to save this country
6045677 wir hatten keine munition mehr um uns mit anderen waffen als unseren famas sturmgewehren zu verteidigen
6045678 frankreich ist ein aufrichtiger freund und wichtiger unterst tzer afghanistans und wir sind zutiefst traurig und schockiert
6045679 die soldaten haben mit mut gek mpft und verdienen respekt
6045680 man kann hoffen dass die bedrohung in dem ma e abnimmt wie die afghanischen truppen die sache in die hand nehmen aber ein risiko besteht
6045681 es geht nicht nur um frieden in der region sondern mit dem terrorismus auch um die sicherheit hier in frankreich und europa
6045682 wer nicht edathys meinung ist ist in seinen augen ein nazi diese hetze geh rt zum ein mal eins linksextremer propaganda jemand mit solch einem beschr nkten weltbild kann jedoch nicht vorsitzender des innenausschusses des deutschen bundestages sein das fass ist bergelaufen edathy muss zur cktreten
6045683 wenn es darum geht vermeintliche sicherheitsgewinne zu produzieren haben cdu und csu m gliche kollateralsch den f r die freiheit selten im auge
6045684 n o teve de maneira alguma o objetivo de coincidir com a decis o do tribunal
6045685 viniendo de un pasado m xico americano es bueno porque no muchos americanos logran hacer algo como esto
6045686 siento que estoy viviendo el sue o americano estados unidos es la tierra de las oportunidades y yo estoy contento de representarla
6045687 esto es lo que dije que iba a hacer me puse mi meta y entren duro s lo junt las piezas y realmente cre en mi mismo y lo hice
6045688 retiro inmediato de las fuerzas rusas a las l neas que manten an antes del brote de las hostilidades y el regreso de las fuerzas georgianas a sus bases habituales
6045689 hoy en esta sala ha habido otro intento de voltear las cosas y retratar a los agresores como la v ctima
6045690 hay una clara expresi n de propaganda en detrimento de un trabajo pol tico importante serio que debe realizarse en el consejo de seguridad
6045691 me parece que es una acci n que si bien desde abril se ten a noticia causa sorpresa dado el car cter de las relaciones que el presidente calder n ha tratado de establecer con su hom logo el presidente hugo ch vez
6045692 seguir golpeando a otras empresas mexicanas si hay una ruptura de relaciones m s fuerte
6045693 se o apetite financeiro de andrei tivesse sido satisfeito bem poss vel que ele estivesse agora jogando no emirates stadim
6045694 wenger esperto como uma raposa e sempre diz uma coisa antes de fazer outra ele quer andrei mas o arsenal o nico dos grandes clubes ingleses que n o paga grandes sal rios
6045695 quando tivemos um a mais em campo faltou dar aquele pique a mais voc n o corre porque acha que o companheiro pode te cobrir precisa correr uma equipe que vem aprendendo e tem o direito de errar em determinados momentos
6045696 tem que existir competitividade se n o vai haver acomoda o e onde h acomoda o n o h trabalho
6045697 o sonho do chelsea acabou porque o real madrid n o vai nem mesmo conversar sobre uma transfer ncia imposs vel avan ar nas negocia es
6045698 na pr xima temporada n s iremos resolver esta situa o desde que as pessoas mostrem bom senso
6045699 n s conseguimos chegar a essa zona de classifica o at antes do que esper vamos pois a meta era alcan la at a quinta rodada do segundo turno por isso temos que aproveitar esses duelos aqui no rio de janeiro para nos consolidarmos nesta posi o depois do cruzeiro teremos pela frente no rio vasco e n utico todos s o advers rios complicados mas precisamos ganhar
6045700 precisamos de um resultado positivo contra o cruzeiro para que a gente possa se firmar nesta quarta posi o e buscar at v os mais altos
6045701 isso acontece devido entrega dos jogadores a dedica o deles as dificuldades das partidas e o empenho nos jogos em que conseguimos os resultados s vezes tem um pre o
6045702 mostrei a todos o que temos de fazer aquilo que acho importante para conseguir o objetivo que vencer no engenh o n o tem m gica e sim trabalho e o conhecimento que temos do grupo em fun o do advers rio n o vejo tanto problema assim
6045703 n s n o pensamos em ficar fora da libertadores mas a realidade de que estar amos fora se acabasse hoje o campeonato por isso temos que melhorar bastante vamos brigar pelo t tulo mas se n o acontecer precisamos conseguir a classifica o para a libertadores
6045704 enquanto houver esperan a temos de pensar no t tulo porque temos a possibilidade de consegui lo
6045705 n o vamos l para se fechar atr s assim seremos massacrados se for para perder vamos perder jogando de igual para igual
6045706 there is definitely some problems with the fccu they have sold some vacuum gas oil vgo in the last few days
6045707 it is down since the last few days and it will take some more time to come up
6045708 unless the shutdown lasts for at least two to three weeks i dont expect this to move the market
6045709 supply is still aplenty and now the chinese are not importing
6045710 there is a very high probability that it will happen in the next three months
6045711 otherwise nothing has changed really i expect the see saw movement to continue for sometime bad news from the international markets would be negative for us and the positive trigger would be if the government steps ahead with reforms
6045712 there is no silver lining here that can take the markets further
6045713 its been almost a month since the government won the trust vote and we havent heard any announcement of major reforms which is a big disappointment for foreign investors
6045714 wir hatten keine munition mehr um uns mit anderen waffen als unseren famas sturmgewehren zu verteidigen
6045715 die kosten und die abgaben m ssen in dieser republik runter und nicht erh ht werden
6045716 wir wollen dieses geld zu 100 prozent in die infrastruktur stecken
6045717 bela karolyi feels that this blog is getting hosed by those damn dirty judges
6045718 i am stuck on 99 goals in italy and i would like to reach 100 in serie a but there is still a lot of time
6045719 i was so ignorant that i thought everybody outside of italy would live like in italy
6045720 i felt that pogatetz was the obvious choice as captain because he is a leader he is such a strong character and has lots of qualities hes an organiser on the pitch
6045721 he missed some of the pre season games but i knew fitness wise it wouldnt be too much of a problem with him
6045722 he got a cut in the first half but there was never any question that he would not be back out for the second half
6045723 the main thing for england is you need players who can play under pressure and do it under the spotlight because you know there is a lot of criticism waiting from the public
6045724 youve got to deal with that that is the hardest obstacle we are going to get over as a team playing under that intense pressure
6045725 some players can do it better than others that is just how it is we need england to get over that psychological barrier
6045726 its a process we might not go out there on wednesday and win 6 0 and have everyone saying we can be world champions we have to be realistic and build on our confidence
6045727 playing for chelsea and playing for england are two completely different things international football is different
6045728 i wouldnt say any one player lacks confidence we need to improve our mentality as a team we are doing that were not burying our heads in the sand we are trying to play and get the ball down we need to stay cool and calm
6045729 its pigeon steps the world cup isnt for two years we need to improve slowly so when we get there we are better physically mentally and technically
6045730 as a group its something we need to improve on we are doing things to improve we need to go out there and be free results help that theres no science to it you need the results to breed confidence
6045731 weve had a bedding in period and we are all looking forward to winning some points
6045732 it just seems a bit ridiculous to me players are off from may 11 to august 16 but now weve got these international games three days after the start of the new season
6045733 this incremental investment is motivated by strong customer demand for integration of suse linux and windows
6045734 cross platform interoperability is something that we all want and need to achieve but its difficult to accomplish this
6045735 the pragmatic approach microsoft and novell are taking to address this complex challenge including ip assurance through engineering as well as offering tangible support and training programs will make it easier for us to develop a path forward
6045736 die aktuelle vcd auto umweltliste zeigt dass viele fahrzeuge auf dem markt sind die einen akzeptablen verbrauch haben und bei l rm und schadstoffen gut abschneiden autok ufer haben also die wahl wenn sie umweltschonend und sparsam unterwegs sein wollen
6045737 w hrend es gerade mal ein deutsches fabrikat unter die top ten schafft dominieren neun pkw aus deutschland klar die umweltbesten kompaktautos
6045738 wir hatten das fahrzeug in unser umweltranking aufgenommen weil uns die daimler ag verbindlich zugesichert hatte dass der diesel smart ab oktober endlich serienm ig mit einem geschlossenen partikelfilter gegen krankmachenden dieselru ausgeliefert wird
6045739 diese mogelpackung entspricht nicht dem stand der technik und unterl uft den notwendigen schutz der gesundheit insbesondere in ballungsgebieten niemand sollte den diesel smart ohne vollwertigen partikelfilter kaufen

6045764 removing infrastructure bottlenecks is seen as a good business opportunity by private players the sector is emerging as a potential employment generator with its share set to leap further
6045765 we envision it being the most comprehensive guide to a horror publishers books ever done it will be bursting with pictures and information to help delirium books collectors collect as well as inform the reader all about delirium books
6045766 we should have waited for two weeks after the july 5 trials to name a final team to the games because one of the athletes who did well at the trials was definitely not at his best but we only realized this later
6045767 paul koech who was fourth at the trials ran the seasons best in europe after the trials but we had declared that was the final team at the trials we should not have done and we shall not do that again
6045768 it was a fluid situation and we did not know how to wiggle through it because the strongest steeplechaser this season was beaten at the trials and we were not ready to take the flak again but let the top three at the trials represent us at the olympics
6045769 the problem was who to drop among kemboi kipruto and mateelong who finished in that order at the trials with koech coming in fourth

6045811 we increasingly want to get our retail presence out in the other countries
6045812 teesdale school has a good record in anti racism and multicultural education
6045813 i am therefore surprised that the governing body has appointed someone who was a candidate for the bnp and i am sure that many parents will be concerned as to whether this is consistent with the pastoral approach the school has taken to its students
6045814 anybody who is doing appointments at schools would have to make sure that the person was able to implement its policies and all schools have to have an anti racism policy
6045815 we were aware of mr walkers political beliefs from day one theres no evidence that he used his time at teesdale school as a political platform
6045816 weve been pleased with the teaching he has carried out for us
6045817 he solved a very difficult position where we were struggling to staff particular courses and he has turned that around we have much to be grateful to him for
6045818 ive really enjoyed my time at the school and i think ive done some good work

6045846 in just one year senator imoke has changed the sports paradigm of the state phenomenally
6045847 not only is calabar rovers back on track fifa have given the state the nod to host the fifa under 17 world cup next year while for the first time in the history of this nation we all witnessed a grand football fiesta in nigeria parading the current uefa and premiership champions manchester united and portsmouth football club of england all these are very vibrant indicators that senator imoke is determined to redress the decadent which had eaten so treacherously into sports in cross river
6045848 this country needs people who match action with their words and senator imoke is one such individual he is so passionate about our youths and their development through the channel of sports and that is why we are all supporting his return
6045849 come friday we will have a dance all those detractors will be made to eat the humble pie because with what senator imoke has done for sports within this short tenure all cross riverians are convinced he will do more for our teeming youths in future
6045850 were very happy with their performance today they have shown that despite everything when the chips are down the players are ready to deliver for their fatherland
6045851 im also very impressed that for once money has not been a major issue the players have settled down to do the job on the field showing how patriotic they can be i hope that they continue with this attitude right up till the final which i believe they have a very good chance of winning
6045852 however my advise to them is that they should not let the win get to their heads because they still have a major task ahead which is to win the gold medal
6045853 yes revenge will be on our minds but right now i want to savour the moment of our win tonight i will be thinking of the final match later
6045854 brazil is a very strong side we were lucky that we took our chances and dont forget they also hit the woodwork twice however i must say on the balance of play i think the better team won
6045855 we are going for the gold i have confidence in this team
6045856 we wanted to change the game a little and make it faster so we decided to give connie jantjes a chance australia play a fast paced game so the coach wants to play more with ball in hand
6045857 jongi played well when he got the chance against argentina two weekends ago and with bryan injured we felt we should give him another chance to prove himself at this level
6045858 we felt danie needed extra time to recover from his injury so that he is ready to play for us at ellis park if he is needed
6045859 schalk has always won a lot of ball for us in the past
6045860 but we do need to be more accurate in the breakdown situation
6045861 we still have a chance in the tri nations and we want to go out and play positive rugby
6045862 we thought wed grow five times not 20 times thats a nice surprise for traffic but maybe not such a pleasant surprise for the cost structure
6045863 we had already positioned ourselves with mainstream and healthy content from day one
6045864 if youre purely user generated then to be honest you may have a lot of racy content and brand advertisers are very wary and uncomfortable
6045865 we would need to do high definition hd to have an online subscription model
6045866 generic content is the scourge of this sector so their ability to sign up original content deals is key
6045867 its major challenge is how to increase the user experience and add user interactivity to its services a video on demand like business is not the key selling point of video sharing and user loyalty for such services is not high youku cannot effectively grow merely by adding more content it needs to think of offering more services to compete with other online video companies

6045951 the time span was two years and the offences took place whilst you were a valued and trusted employee of charlie miller

6045962 in relation to foreigners holding demonstrations in beijing in support of tibet independence competent authorities have the right to handle these things according to law
6045963 id also like to emphasize that in china activities that support tibet independence will be strongly condemned by the chinese people and will not be welcomed

6045976 consumers need real protections against unscrupulous builders who build shoddy homes and the trcc has never provided homeowners with that kind of protection
6045977 we were created to help consumers and builders and remodelers to resolve differences thats what weve been doing
6045978 was never meant to be a true regulatory agency with a clear mission of protecting the public
6045979 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity

6046019 one of the mightiest men of prayer of the last generation was george mueller of bristol england who in the last sixty years of his life he lived to be ninety two or ninety three obtained the english equivalent of 7 200 000 00 by prayer but george mueller never prayed for a thing just because he wanted it or even just because he felt it was greatly needed for gods work when it was laid upon george muellers heart to pray for anything he would search the scriptures to find if there was some promise that covered the case sometimes he would search the scriptures for days before he presented his petition to god and then when he found the promise with his open bible before him and his finger upon that promise he would plead that promise and so he received what he asked he always prayed with an open bible before him

6046091 matty derbyshire got a good run of goals when he went to wrexham and kicked on from there i am sure jamie has seen that and theres no reason why he cant do the same
6046092 he has settled in well with the lads here and has the confidence to express himself and once he gets that first goal im sure that will set him off
6046093 i think once he gets his first one which will not be too far away he will get confidence from that and kick on
6046094 its early days we have only played three or four games and we are still learning about how each other plays
6046095 once we get on the same wavelength a bit more i think we can be an effective partnership we are probably only about 50 per cent at the moment and there is a lot more to come from both of us
6046096 its not an easy league because its quite physical it was probably a shock to him after the level of football hes been used to youve got to compete physically in this league and hes getting to grips with that

6046101 the first two games have been disappointing but its important not to get too low
6046102 we have a point to prove on a couple of fronts
6046103 firstly theres the two results then the palace game from the back end of last season is still relatively fresh in the mind as well
6046104 its important that we dont get too down on ourselves because weve not become a bad team overnight
6046105 we just need to try to address a couple of things
6046106 this is why people cant get carried away in pre season
6046107 its all about getting fit and thats all that matters it went well and we came through without any injuries
6046108 the two results are the most important thing and they havent gone our way
6046109 but weve got enough characters in the dressing room to recover
6046110 my priority was to play for burnley and then focus on northern ireland
6046111 i wasnt expecting to be called up so quickly after only playing a few games but the manager nigel worthington has phoned me three or four times while ive been out to keep me informed on things and to follow how my rehabilitations been going and hes decided to have a look at me
6046112 he hasnt spoken to me on my own as such he just said he was pleased to have me back and its business as usual
6046113 its nice to be back and good to see everybody again
6046114 there are a couple of new faces but the majority are the same
6046115 you get quite pally with a lot of the lads because you spend so much time together on internationals living in each others pockets for a few days
6046116 its a good game to have and even closer than a lot of home games we have in the league
6046117 im not expecting to start because im still just coming back from the injury im just happy to be in the squad
6046118 if im not starting im just hoping to get on and get another cap and then its just a case of building from that

6046788 the nation pays tribute to the memory of your 10 comrades
6046789 they fulfilled their duties to the fullest and it cost them their lives which reminds us that being a soldier is a job like no other
6046790 the cause is just it is an honor for france and its armies to defend them
6046791 reinforced with quick reaction forces close air support and mobile medical teams
6046792 15 to 20 percent of democrats or democratic leaning independents may not support
6046793 17 to 19 percent of white democrats and democratic leaning independents will resist voting for obama because he is black
6046794 this appears to be a sensible package of measures and will provide a welcome shot in the arm to the construction sector north of the border
6046795 it is encouraging that ministers have taken up the suggestion that they accelerate the spending of their capital budget for new social rented housing as this will provide much needed work for housebuilders over the coming year
6046796 with 15 000 jobs already lost and new build starts in scotland down by almost 50 in the last quarter this is welcome news indeed
6046797 we welcome the scottish governments decision to bring forward the allocated funding and give a key role to housing associations this gives local authorities greater flexibility and recognises that housing associations are best placed to meet the needs of the affordable housing sector
6046798 the snps credit is low after disappointing first time buyers by failing to deliver on its promise to provide 2 000 grants and now deliberately setting out to mislead the public that they are providing new money
6046799 we wanted to provide installers with a simple and effective way to address this problem
6046800 that aid in producing the highest quality of sound in cinema

6046802 we are now bringing our technology to the home theater marketplace
6046803 we are a good fit because our plasma consoles look like high end furniture pieces
6046804 based on our research our competitors are not emphasizing style in their plasma console designs we have very nice finishes and pay attention to the fashion aspect of these consoles as well as function
6046805 have not seen anything like this and the system serves a great purpose to engage customers with a new option
6046806 outstanding performance aside the foxl has so many uses and is so convenient its like an audio swiss army knife everybody who listens to music should have one of these
6046807 right now we are working to make sure our datastream output will work effectively with all the different media servers on the market
6046808 we have two big lifeguard chairs kind of a beach theme
6046809 we cant let them climb up on the high chairs but were going to be showing them how they mount all the hardware thats normally used for mounting underwater pool speakers theyll see what the speaker looks like and what the finished installed product look like the speakers will be in normal displays not underwater we cant have people putting their heads underwater
6046810 we try to be really out of the box in what we do with trade show displays
6046811 ninoy aquino day former senate president ours is to keep lighting the beacon light of freedom for those who have lost their way ours is to articulate the fervent hopes of a people who have suddenly lost their voices ours is to adopt the solid stance of courage in the face of seemingly hopeless odds so that hope no matter how dim or distant will never vanish from sight

6046855 ill be taking nearly 50 000 steps its going to wear on your muscles quite a bit more youre gonna be much more fatigued in a shorter period of time
6046856 many of the athletes and surprisingly some of the chinese athletes said this course is going to be very very difficult
6046857 its going to be very hard on the athletes who are already out there struggling for up to four hours
6046858 with elite athletes that are pushing themselves to the edge they will be prone to developing heel pain arch strain mid foot strain as people come forward forefoot pain

6046869 shes a lovely mare but things have gone wrong for her like wet tracks and bad barriers
6046870 ive always said she needs a mile or even 1900 metres to show her best
6046871 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6046872 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6046873 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6046874 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6046875 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6046876 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6046877 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6046878 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6046879 i dont know how many times were going to say no
6046880 i think if you get the kind of reforms that im talking about then it might be a good trade off
6046881 we are excited to add this unmatched technology to our saas applications and force com platform

6046888 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6046889 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6046890 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6046891 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6046892 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6046893 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6046894 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6046895 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6046896 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6046897 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6046898 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6046899 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6046900 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6046901 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6046902 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6046903 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6046904 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6046905 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6046906 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6046907 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6046908 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6046909 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6046910 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6046911 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6046912 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6046913 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6046914 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6046915 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6046916 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6046917 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6046918 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6046919 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6046920 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6046921 butterfly glitter of brenden the old brenden year capetown the youtube face cronicles
6046922 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6046923 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6046924 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6046925 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6046926 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6046927 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6046928 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6046929 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6046930 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6046931 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6046932 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6046933 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6046934 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6046935 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6046936 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6046937 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6046938 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6046939 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6046940 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6046941 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6046942 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6046943 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
6046944 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
6046945 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
6046946 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6046947 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6046948 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6046949 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6046950 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6046951 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6046952 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6046953 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6046954 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6046955 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6046956 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6046957 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6046958 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6046959 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

6046962 in der causa bad saag welches finanzreferent walter zwick verkaufen m chte muss schnellstens mit dem land verhandelt werden

6046964 der gemeinderat ist an den beschluss gebunden wonach bad saag nicht an privatpersonen verkauft werden darf welche schriftlichen und vertraglichen zusicherungen gibt es dass das bad seinen ffentlichkeitscharakter nicht verlieren wird
6046965 mich wundert es nicht dass p chter badeg ste und b rgerinitiative ver rgert sind schlie lich versprach walter zwick in der gemeinderatssitzung vom 28 09 2004 dass ein verkauf an private nicht in frage k me nun sind ernsthafte verhandlungen zu f hren ich werde bei dem n chsten treffen zwischen vertretern des landes der sig und dem finanzreferenten walter zwick beiwohnen um die angelegenheit einer positiven l sung zuzuf hren

6046968 eines ist jetzt schon klar die controllingsysteme der kabeg werden zu hinterfragen sein

6046983 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6046984 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6046985 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos

6046987 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6046988 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6046989 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6046990 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6046991 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6046992 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6046993 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6046994 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
6046995 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
6046996 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
6046997 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
6046998 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
6046999 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
6047000 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
6047001 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
6047002 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
6047003 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6047004 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6047005 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6047006 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6047007 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6047008 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6047009 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6047010 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6047011 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6047012 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6047013 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6047014 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6047015 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6047016 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6047017 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6047018 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6047019 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6047020 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6047021 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6047022 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6047023 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6047024 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6047025 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6047026 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6047027 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6047028 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6047029 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6047030 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6047031 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6047032 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6047033 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6047034 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6047035 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6047036 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6047037 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6047038 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6047039 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6047040 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6047041 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6047042 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6047043 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6047044 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6047045 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6047046 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6047047 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6047048 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
6047049 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
6047050 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6047051 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno

6047058 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6047059 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6047060 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
6047061 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

6047088 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6047089 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
6047090 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6047091 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
6047092 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6047093 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6047094 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6047095 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6047096 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6047097 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6047098 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6047099 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6047100 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6047101 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6047102 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6047103 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6047104 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6047105 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6047106 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6047107 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6047108 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6047109 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

6047167 ainda bem que o presidente da rep blica teve em conta o maior bem das pessoas e uma consci ncia tica cr tica da leviandade com que muitas vezes o parlamento produz leis

6047184 the funding i am announcing today will ensure that the special constabulary can grow and continue their outstanding work
6047185 but there is concern that there was a costly campaign a few years back that produced very little only five or six recruited
6047186 so from a federation point of view its important that the government learn the lessons of previous campaigns on recruitment
6047187 policing is about building up a rapport and links with the local community so its about meeting nice people as well often the victims of crime
6047188 weve seen more specials more police community support officers and more police officers as well this is not about either or its about building the policing family

6047265 john mccain has begun rallying dispirited republicans behind him while democratic rival barack obama has made scant progress building new support leaving the presidential race statistically tied
6047266 obamas favorable rating has slid from 59 to 48 since the june poll at the same time his negative rating has risen from 27 to 35 the bulk of that shift stems from republicans souring on obama amid ferocious attacks on the democrat by mccain and his allies
6047267 more than eight out of 10 voters say mccains patriotism is strong compared with just 55 percent for obama
6047268 overall mccain has a slight edge on the question of honesty and integrity while more than three times as many voters say obama would change the way things are done in washington
6047269 i will let no one question my love of this country
6047270 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell sen mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6047271 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment
6047272 where are john mccains writings exploring the vexing moral issues of our time where are his position papers setting forth his careful consideration of foreign policy the welfare state education americas moral responsibility in the world etc etc etc john mccain graduated 894th in a class of 899 at the naval academy at annapolis his father and grandfather were four star admirals in the navy some have suggested that might have played a role in mccain being admitted his academic record was awful and it shows over and over again whenever mccain is called upon to think on his feet

6047304 if i think about too much it might mess me up
6047305 shes not tall big or fast but shes tricky with the ball shes had great skill work
6047306 during breaks in practice shes doing extra juggling off to the side she puts in 110 percent all the time
6047307 when i go up against someone it just comes i guess
6047308 its fun you just forget about everything else when youre on the soccer field
6047309 if i wasnt doing the extra work i wouldnt be getting touches on the ball and i like playing against more advanced players
6047310 the best way to describe her is that shes everywhere
6047311 you cant have just one player mark her you have to play zone
6047312 ma i blitz delle forze dellordine che leggo sui quotidiani non dovevano aver eliminato il problema dellabusivismo commerciale

6047315 were trying to get a list of names to see if people are interested in serving on a core committee
6047316 will help the board make a decision narrow down options
6047317 were trying to get a variety of people in each area served by a triway building
6047318 people know that weve been pretty conservative in the past
6047319 theres not much chance of something like starting over happening
6047320 like we are when we make any other financial decision
6047321 im glad we have community involvement at the level were going to have
6047322 im glad district residents are going to get a lot of say in what we do
6047323 take a shot at putting triway administrators and coaches in the tank
6047324 it was nice to see them duking it out and competing
6047325 theyre going to have to work hard and compete against one another from here on out everything gets a lot bigger so it was nice for them to come and get their feet wet
6047326 tangible goals such as occ and regional goals will be set later right now were just worrying about the things we need to do to get better every day
6047327 i have 10 seniors and nine juniors so that tells you right there the experience that we have
6047328 the team with the veterans and the senior leadership they really help our younger ones and its nice coming here because i can get everyone in the same race and we can line up a pecking order
6047329 the girls have been working extremely hard all summer they had organized running together so i was expecting to just get a lot better
6047330 i just think he came back out because he knew he was a really talented runner
6047331 they both know the game really well and have both been sort of coaches on the field
6047332 ive been learning about how other people play because a lot of soccer is learning how youre teammates play and them learning how you play
6047333 just getting in the groove with everybody its been a little tough but its coming around now
6047334 just teaching them where to make their runs and where i like to pass
6047335 its about me learning where they like to run and then we just work together and figure out what works best
6047336 ive just been teaching them how to move and how to fall back when i go up
6047337 just how to mark up and see what needs done
6047338 its fun to get back into it we got some decent players and it will be interesting to see if we get it to jell
6047339 the other kids have started to imitate their approach to practice
6047340 thats your leadership role and theyve stepped out and taken hold of it
6047341 we have a long way to go yet but its been fun getting back into it
6047342 weve been planning on relocating for a couple years but just havent found the place
6047343 one reason were moving is because were trying to get away from that whole thing thats been going on up there to get away from the problems and troublemakers who would frequent that place
6047344 were trying to focus more on the restaurant and not so much the bar
6047345 there are certainly questions in my mind regarding a substantial sized nightclub on our citys midsection with more than 5 000 square feet and ample parking going to a 1 200 foot bar downtown
6047346 id like to have a better understanding regarding the scope and change of the business i dont think its out of the realm of reason that we have a better understanding
6047347 what youve done is invoked section 4303 292 of the ohio revised code which governs grounds for refusal of transfers
6047348 i believe i heard one of you say you would like to have an explanation from the owner applicant of her business plan that is not one of the bases for successfully objecting to the transfer of a liquor permit
6047349 i look at this from the standpoint of what i will be presenting to the hearing officer that will satisfy them that this city council has probable cause to believe this transfer should not be permitted

6047355 we were all ready to make some really hard decisions
6047356 were at the bare minimum now its a relief to know we dont have to go to the point where were damaging the kids education
6047357 to finally have that tension gone from the building frees us to do our job to the best of our ability
6047358 theres a lot of competition out there for a childs attention
6047359 kids still love to open a book i know that if i can get a child to finish one book in a series they will read that entire series whenever you have that happen you feel like youre doing your job
6047360 i think as a person you improve every year its that way for a school too
6047361 this is the second year that the school has been named a school of promise by the ohio department of education it would be a shame to see it close i wouldnt want to work anywhere else
6047362 we had an active discussion with the students and they were concerned
6047363 they were worried about overcrowded cars and kids trying to sneak more kids in the car than the law allows

6047372 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile attacks from countries like iran or north korea
6047373 were talking about a missile defense system that couldnt possibly be aimed at the russian nuclear deterrent
6047374 russia has thousands of nuclear warheads this is for small missile attacks of the kind that iran might launch

6047383 that was one of several recent policy shifts for obama as he positions himself for the general election battle but zogby said the changes could be taking a toll on obamas support particularly among democrats and self described liberals
6047384 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters zogby said obamas support among democrats fell 9 percentage points this month to 74 percent while mccain has the backing of 81 percent of republicans support for obama an illinois senator fell 12 percentage points among liberals with 10 percent of liberals still undecided compared to 9 percent of conservatives

6047428 women who get drunk are more likely to be raped than women who do not get drunk no this does not excuse rape men who take advantage of women by raping them drunk or sober should be severely punished for this wicked treacherous action however stupid the victim may have been but it does mean that a rape victim who was drunk deserves less sympathy
6047429 its all the mans fault and women take no responsibility for anything
6047430 it is not the same as them drunk driving and hitting someone
6047431 walking out in front of a car and getting hit
6047432 women who get drunk are more likely to be raped than women who do not get drunk no this does not excuse rape
6047433 men who take advantage of women by raping them drunk or sober should be severely punished for this wicked treacherous action however stupid the victim may have been but it does mean that a rape victim who was drunk deserves less sympathy
6047434 botched job police pension fund or from the briefs who wax lyrical and long in court on cause and justice whilst picking up the legal aid giveaway
6047435 of course she is culpable just as she would be culpable if she crashed a car and injured someone while drunk or stepped out into the traffic while drunk and was run over getting drunk is not something that happens to you it is something you do
6047436 getting drunk is not something that happens to you it is something you do
6047437 someone called bridget prentice a one time teacher who now has the banana republic title of justice minister actually said last week that a victim of rape is not in any way culpable due to alcohol consumption
6047438 men who take advantage of women by raping them drunk or sober should be severely punished for this wicked treacherous action however stupid the victim may have been
6047439 it does mean that a rape victim who was drunk deserves less sympathy
6047440 over 5000 people were killed in the terrorist violence in northern ireland some people peter hitchens might think it was worth granting concessions to the ira in order to stop the violence
6047441 of course she is culpable just as she would be culpable if she crashed a car and injured someone while drunk or stepped out into the traffic while drunk and was run over
6047442 this is flatly untrue and she must know it is of course she is culpable just as she would be culpable if she crashed a car and injured someone while drunk
6047443 getting drunk is not something that happens to you it is something you do
6047444 i always lock up my car and dont leave the keys in the ignition
6047445 i buy expensive security for my car and my house so as to protect them best from thieves sure id like to think i could leave my front door open and the ignition keys in but if my house was burgled and my car stolen then id deserve less sympathy than my neighbour who took better care
6047446 there are far too many reasons why a woman might cry rape especially in this hysterical age that to ruin a mans life at the onset of a possible case by revealing only his name to the press
6047447 nn nnoooo iihh duuunnotd wandd to hhave sssex wwithh yuuu
6047448 this sets a precedent for morning after regrets being validated legally
6047449 99 99 of the time one or both of them are drunk both are stupid and both are quite willingly having sex
6047450 if you are a victim of crime you can sometimes get financial compensation from the state these days
6047451 why should the tax payer fund huge payouts that no private insurance company ever would an insurance policy against being raped if such a thing existed would almost certainly contain a clause preventing a claim in the event of the policy holder being under the influence of drink
6047452 you would allow a rapist who drank to plead diminished responsibility yet you claim the victim has greater responsibility cant have it both ways boyo
6047453 i can provide you with some statistics however check them theyre easy to find approximately 10 25 of rapes are reported
6047454 thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also
6047455 99 99 of the time one or both of them are drunk both are stupid and both are quite willingly having sex
6047456 by peter hitchens hare brained logic a woman who is raped by her dentist while shes under anaesthetic deserves less sympathy too
6047457 using the flawed logic displayed in this article one could blame the government for handing out drivers licenses to those poor blokes who get killed behind the wheel of a car
6047458 let me leave you with this scenario if it was a male who was raped by another male would the state dream of cutting the victims compensation based on alcohol consumption
6047459 ive read your article most carefully peter hitchens a drunk man or women should be able to rely on the common decency of the community around them and the common decency of thought which you dont have the courage to grasp your attitude is morally defunct shame on you
6047460 thank you peter hitchens for reminding us to return to our cooking and sewing back home where we are far more certain to be safe
6047461 i can provide you with some statistics however check them theyre easy to find approximately 10 25 of rapes are reported not 6 of these lead to a conviction and dont tell me that all the others were false conviction rate between 0 5 and 1 5 wheres the injustice now
6047462 if i claim that there are 100 000 violent crimes committed by black people would it be fair if i could only substantiate 5000 the home office tells us that it investigates 12 000 rapes a year but only 600 5 can be substantiated does this mean in the first case 95 000 got away with it no it means there was no case to answer
6047463 here are few statistics of my own in the uk it is estimated that are over one million women with borderline or severe personality disorders in the usa that figure is estimated to be about three million the majority of reported rapes come from amongst this group of people time and time again sometimes from the same women
6047464 do you not think that the massacres there had something to do with why serbia was bombed into submission

6047475 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years they are never held accountable
6047476 the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of the armed mexican being unaware that they violated us sovereignty
6047477 as i recall a few years back a mexican soldier shot a 50 calibre
6047478 particularly galling is the fact that the mexican military often pulls these stunts in humvees donated to them by the american taxpayers although they were apparently on foot this time we note that border patrol agents have historically driven worn out junk vehicles
6047479 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at homeland security they are in charge
6047480 every american should be offended and outraged by comparisons between our dedicated public servants risking their lives every day to enforce our immigration laws and the nazi secret police no matter who is making the comparison that such a vile statement was made by a member of congress is truly reprehensible and irresponsible
6047481 it seems as if the folks in washington dc are telling the border patrol agents and the american people that were on our own when it comes to foreign soldiers cops and criminals who come into our country from mexico
6047482 what will it take to get the senate and house of representatives to pass a veto proof immigration bill that will have some teeth in it
6047483 russias actions in georgia will have consequences russias failure to keep its word and withdraw troops from georgia risks the countrys standing as part of the international community that is not the future the united states or europe want but it is the future russia may get
6047484 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be one of the most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism the claims of georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for russias invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers and the continuing presence of russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region the war that began in georgia is no longer about that country alone it has become a question of whether and how the west will stand up for the rights of free people throughout the region
6047485 the urgent problem is for us to get ready for this governors hearing
6047486 traditional notions of fair justice demand that we allow the state police to complete their investigation

6047497 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
6047498 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6047499 i would have liked to see it go much slower
6047500 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6047501 those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk
6047502 you can only study a vaccine for so long before you license and use it in a population where it has enormous value
6047503 our hope and belief is that this is a remarkable vaccine that will have huge impact on women
6047504 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
6047505 some of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care im not against vaccines but in canada and the u s women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer
6047506 this initiative was seen as a good use of resources that fits with the governments health priorities and political priorities
6047507 if we do this quickly and badly we could cause more deaths
6047508 when you get a letter saying this is what you need to do to protect your girls of course you do it
6047509 i chose to get vaccinated because my dreams dont include cervical cancer
6047510 i understand that the information i provide will be used by merck or those working on behalf of merck for market research purposes

6047515 the immunity of gardasil will not last that is dangerous to assume
6047516 well worry about whether boosters are needed down the road
6047517 gardasil continues to be safe and effective and its benefits continue to outweigh its risks
6047518 her parents are scientists they know better than to assume gardasil caused her disease
6047519 you inevitably find adverse events that you wouldnt have suspected
6047520 cervical cancer is a worthwhile disease to prevent in a country that has the resources
6047521 are you really going to say a girl cant start school because she hasnt had this vaccine

6047524 the observance of one minute of silence at each school
6047525 reflect pray meditate or engage in any other silent activity
6047526 taking the bible and teacher led prayer out of schools is apparently not enough for these plaintiffs who now want to ban even the mention of prayer in texas schools texas schools are upholding the american ideal of the free exercise of religion by allowing students to voluntarily choose to pray during the moment of silence at the beginning of their school day what offends these plaintiffs is that students might actually believe that there is a higher authority and a higher law to which they shall be held accountable isnt that really freedom

6047531 though the owners of the trademark have no objection to your use of the name the chronicle the owners do object to the use of the words chronicle and christian together for the designation of a religious news publication because of the confusion created and infringement on the registered trademark

6047533 as christians we are cautious about situations which require legal activity

6047538 the bush administration will soon propose regulations to protect healthcare professionals from being forced to participate in immoral practices astonishingly abortion proponents vehemently oppose this they are against the right of doctors to choose not to do abortions
6047539 federal laws protect the right of healthcare providers not to participate in abortion or other controversial practices but the laws are ignored recently two medical associations passed guidelines that could require doctors to commit or refer for abortions
6047540 planned parenthood and some media are trying to frame the new regulations as an attack on contraception
6047541 abortion advocates are causing a ruckus about a rule that simply requires health agencies to follow the law and not to discriminate against people with moral beliefs against taking an innocent life
6047542 secretary leavitt provided an excellent explanation on his blog its been flooded with negative comments from abortion advocates demanding that health providers do whatever a woman demands
6047543 as patients we depend with our lives on health providers to be moral but if ethical professionals with strong consciences are forced out of the profession patients will suffer the most
6047544 anche dell nella mischia a breve il mini inspiron 910
6047545 the interest rate freeze is good news but its just a respite the economic uncertainty is not over yet hard pressed consumers and homeowners should see the reserve banks decision as second chance for them to get their finances in order not a sign that things are on the up and they can start spending again
6047546 there has been enormous pressure on tito mboweni not to put up interest rates again for fear that it will push even more people over the edge into over indebtedness and insolvency
6047547 so we really are not out of the woods yet particularly as house prices are continuing to stall and food and energy costs are still up despite the oil price fall consumers need to focus on getting their finances under control reducing their spending if possible and staying far away from debt because the next interest rate decision might not be so positive
6047548 one possibility is that a suboptimal immune system may predate the onset of both respiratory disease and mental disorders
6047549 it could also be that some combination of environmental and genetic risk factors lead to the co occurrence of respiratory disease and anxiety disorders
6047550 may have implications for prevention or early intervention with groups at high risk for anxiety disorders

6047569 in a year where a number of shows made it to the final animated discussion the four nominees presented shows which combined outstanding material and performance and offer something comedic for everyone
6047570 the newcomer nomination list reflects the extremely talented crop of new performers we are delighted to see two highly impressive women amongst the three nominees
6047571 to have insured nearly a half million people in less than two years is nothing short of remarkable
6047572 the significant reduction in free care through the health safety net provides further evidence that health care reform is having its intended effect
6047573 we appreciate the efforts of all parties but will need to ensure that we can sustain the effort going forward
6047574 based on what i could gather i didnt see any real significant savings from energy costs by going to a four day workweek at least across the board

6047578 i would say that the javafx platform looks very good it has a lot of potential
6047579 it probably should have been announced three four five years ago
6047580 technically javafx enables me to leverage the java skill set and java technology that i am more comfortable with to deliver a compelling ria solution because synergy between javafx and java is excellent and the fact that javafx is built on the java platform means that i can ensure that i have one of the best and supportive platforms to work in in addition javafx will enable me to be more productive in making it easier and quicker to create ria solutions

6047582 javafx script the language of javafx doesnt replace swing the core java gui toolkit but provides an alternative way of programming that hopefully will bring java technology to the masses
6047583 javafx takes that momentum and the advantages we have with java but makes it much easier to create rich interactive and immersive experiences
6047584 it matches the way they think about interfaces in their head and is very intuitive
6047585 the update provides a much faster loading process for the applets
6047586 the platform promises a lot of new apis and new abstractions to make the harder things simpler and the simpler things very easy
6047587 it is hard to imagine what management system creates such

6047771 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
6047772 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
6047773 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
6047774 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
6047775 we all had some bad news today our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
6047776 there are those who stay at home and those who go away and it has always been so everyone can choose for himself but he must choose while there is still time and never change his mind

6047784 the lord is with you while you are with him if you seek him he will be found by you but if you forsake him he will forsake you

6047816 they stepped in our soil and so they started occupation of our lands and so we very peacefully with flags and transparence are going to the russian soldiers to show we are united and so we are not going to surrender
6047817 the withdrawal has not yet started and in that situation everybody has to be aware of the risk that any even minor incident may have consequences and it may unleash a chain of events that would be difficult to control

6047851 paul is excited about going on tour initially he wanted to go it alone with just his band and road crew with family flying out every now and again but now he wants nancy to be with him all the way
6047852 he says he had the time of his life on the road trip with nancy i think it really sealed things for him he enjoys her company so much

6047854 i did a scene with brad in the back of a taxi and it was only a few days after he had married jennifer i chatted to him for hours giving him advice about the three stages of marriage
6047855 stage one is perfection blind love stage two is the difficult stage because you start to despise everything about her if you can deal with the baggage you can possibly get to stage three a harmonious marriage

6047866 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
6047867 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
6047868 americas future depends on the health of our country the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs our analysis shows that we are not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
6047869 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority
6047870 this suggests that arsenic would play a role in the development of diabetes
6047871 but there clearly needs to be additional research conducted because our study has certain limitations we are conducting those studies now but thats going to take a few years
6047872 this is a good base for future research but its a small sample size and doesnt look at dose response
6047873 in terms of magnitude people in taiwan and bangladesh are exposed to at least 10 times higher levels compared to people in the u s
6047874 we were interested in investigating if arsenic exposure at low and moderate levels could be related to diabetes
6047875 when we adjusted for diabetes risk factors and for markers of seafood intake we found this moderate to strong relationship between arsenic and the prevalence of diabetes
6047876 there are still many americans with arsenic in drinking water at levels above safety standards
6047877 this reinforces how important it is that all drinking water is below this standard the good news is that we can actually do something to eliminate arsenic from water

6047887 this confirms what a lot of recent studies have found no benefit of taking vitamin b supplements to reduce the risk of heart disease and it raises a few red flags
6047888 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events
6047889 there is no evidence that individuals should take b vitamins to decrease the risk of heart disease and there may be some evidence that they shouldnt
6047890 the observational data was great but the interventional studies were negative
6047891 we have been optimistic about the role of antioxidants such as vitamin b in preventing heart disease yet many of these large trials have shown that there is no benefit
6047892 but at this point it is certainly hard to recommend extra supplements when we dont have proof of benefit
6047893 what we can recommend is a diet with fruits and vegetables that have antioxidant vitamins in them

6047897 yunus implemented a model that became a success we want to learn from someone who has tried and tested a model
6047898 its not just a function professor yunus is the highlight but we hope to take real issues we hope to be able by converging to move the industry forward and i know certainly that those who come will learn and be better off for coming
6047899 when he yunus comes and shares his experience well be able to take the ones we can implement in nigeria there is nothing we can do with a foreign model that will not take nigeria as a country into consideration the nature of our people the way we do business here our history and experience with community banks
6047900 were pretty happy that we came up with rather realistic tumor sizes although this is a very basic model it should give researchers a tool to use when deciding if a particular secreted protein would be a good biomarker
6047901 early cancer detection is a very challenging but important goal for the cancer field this modeling work enables a very deep understanding of the problems that will have to be solved for blood based cancer biomarkers to be successful in this effort
6047902 the original finding is that grapefruit juice markedly boosts the amount of drug that gets into the bloodstream
6047903 if this study holds true in future research you are going to have to warn people in a similar fashion
6047904 a glass is better than a sip it helps dissolve the tablet
6047905 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit of silver coated endotracheal tubes
6047906 consequently silver coated tubes should not be viewed as the definitive answer for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and until additional data confirm the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of these devices their issue should be restricted to high risk patients treated in icus with benchmark value based infection rates that remain above institutional goals despite implementation of a comprehensive strategy of usual preventive measures to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia
6047907 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
6047908 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
6047909 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment
6047910 medicare web site is somewhat difficult for people to use
6047911 when e health tools are designed designers really have to think about a broad and inclusive group of users and what their needs and abilities are
6047912 we really have to think who we are designing these web sites for what their needs are and what their capabilities are
6047913 we cant assume that everyone has a sophisticated level of computer skills
6047914 without that information we question the usefulness of the study
6047915 cms has worked to organize and format these tools in a consumer friendly manner by conducting both qualitative and quantitative research of the web site tools with multiple audiences
6047916 the information gathered from testing is used to make improvements to the web site our research is ongoing and the web site continues to make enhancements on an incremental basis
6047917 it would be nice to have an administration more committed to people understanding what their rights are
6047918 the administration could provide better quality services with more accuracy
6047919 in fairness its also true that congress and the bush administration has made so much of medicare so complex that even folks with the best of intentions are going to be misdirecting consumers
6047920 its absolutely true that the complexity that president bush has brought to medicare during his two terms in office has been unfortunate
6047921 this is an interesting merger in that the new company will be a supplier to all the big mobile companies except motorola

6047924 this technique is really the first time that cancer surgeons can see structures that are otherwise invisible providing true image guided surgery if were able to see cancer we have a chance of curing it
6047925 above and beyond the prediction made by performance on neuropsychological tests if you take into account the degree to which the individual varies in their cognitive abilities theres an independent risk of dementia
6047926 the investigators found that relatively brief measures of memory and executive function reassessed annually would allow physicians to predict of dementia before the patient scores in the clearly impaired range
6047927 this study brings us one step closer to a simple safe and reliable test of dementia risk
6047928 because when you think about it logically the reason were living longer is because were healthier and if were healthier at any given age then were less likely to be disabled
6047929 all the nursing homes will choke as more and more people spend much more time disabled
6047930 but in reality that hasnt really worked out to be the case
6047931 this is very good news that i can give to some very old people
6047932 i can tell my elderly patients that their chances of being able to take care of themselves 10 years from now is the same as it is now
6047933 as i like to say the older you get the healthier youve been
6047934 so getting to 100 really is a survival phenomenon and people who get there necessarily have to have been disability free not only in their early 90s but pretty much for the vast majority of their lives

6047945 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes

6047984 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him

6047988 thats happened to me twice in my career and believe me its disappointing but wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reason to come back or wanting to come back to prove someone wrong or wanting to come back from what happened this offseason
6047989 the only reason i came back was i wanted to play its as simple as that
6047990 believe me i wanted to win the game but i give them a tremendous amount of credit and respect
6047991 thats over and done with obviously its a new year and a lot of things have changed
6047992 im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league and were just trying to get better this week
6047993 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
6047994 if im going to come out here and practice i want to play the whole game thats just my mentality will that happen no were going to be smart about it and whatever eric wants to do we havent really talked about it
6047995 for the most part its the things that people dont see that weve got to get on board with in a hurry
6047996 sight adjustments audibles things like that whats the easiest way for me to get to those is it using a term thats already in place or maybe coming up with a new term and not to mention changing it up and having more than one term for a lot of things i mean its a work in progress and i think thatll be the case all year long
6047997 in our 2 minute drill today we made some real good plays a lot of signals were given today some things that i had recommended maybe we try
6047998 we kind of just turned it loose today we did good on a couple and didnt do quite as well on the other ones the good thing is that it was practice we can go back and look at it on film and make the corrections
6047999 i said well theres no substitute for game type situations the 2 minute drills red zone situations third down situations you cant do them all in one day but were trying to throw those in

6048001 we work in the public service but that doesnt mean they can treat us like servants rather than workers there comes a point when you have to say enough
6048002 they are constantly looking for ways to attack our conditions by the back door which is bad enough but to expect people to take a pay cut as well is just too much
6048003 i saw the other week that they have cut the city bonuses because of the credit crunch but bankers on hundreds of thousands can afford cuts we cant afford to lose money
6048004 the strike has more public sympathy than usual because everybody is under the same pressure the government says it cant do anything about recession but it can it decides where to spend money and it has decided to get workers to make sacrifices
6048005 i think some in the union leaderships have been a bit too close to labour which is all well and good but it should about representing us not keeping in with gordon brown
6048006 were not on strike for a pay rise inflation means we are on strike to stop them cutting our wages today should be enough to get a decent offer but if its not then we all need to come out again
6048007 the strike has had a massive impact across the city many offices are shut down completely and others are running on an emergency staffing operation
6048008 the picket lines have gone well at the council headquarters 50 joined the picket line for many its their first picket line as well people have been joining the union in the run up to the strike and have come on the picket lines today
6048009 people on the picket lines have put a lot of work in and were really glad to be out across the city the strike has been overwhelmingly solid
6048010 the pickets have done a really good job of turning people away from work the strike has been solid across all three authorities in ayrshire
6048011 hardly anyone went into work and there were pickets at most council workplaces
6048012 people are angry about the derisory pay offer we have had and the fact that its for three years this will mean that everything is uncertain for people as we dont know what inflation will be next year
6048013 gmb unison and unite members have congregated outside st nicholas house the councils headquarters to have a bigger picket
6048014 there has been good action and a lively atmosphere in dundee with a lot of anger
6048015 no councillors crossed the picket line at the city chambers
6048016 there was a march of some 80 to 90 people to a lunchtime rally of around 200 strikers

6048019 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now

6048022 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6048023 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6048151 we knew we could win this match only by getting wickets we tried hard but dhoni and badrinath batted really well and their partnership took the game away from us
6048152 the important thing was to be consistent and bowl in right areas
6048153 as a spearhead of the attack it was important for me to provide early breakthroughs all the bowlers did well and kept pressure on their batsmen

6048162 hes a guy who had command of both sides of the plate and command of the strike zone

6048253 we take a dim view on things seen today and we were very close to revoking your license
6048254 we were not satisfied that your records of incidents were being recorded so this is a last chance for you
6048255 i am very disappointed by the decision all of the incidents shown were outside of my premises and i dont think it is fair that my door staff are expected to police the streets closing us at 2am will mean we will lose a lot of custom and it will be hard for us to make any money when we are only breaking even as it is now that fusion has closed and with us now having to close at 2am it will cause more problems for other late night bars in the town
6048256 hogs and heffers is being run a long way short of legally it is important that door supervisors sign in and there are the correct number present and are seen to be present
6048257 considering how much traffic travels along that route everyday its really not that bad
6048258 thousands of vehicles travel between england and scotland every day
6048259 i am amazed at the compliance rates to be honest especially given the complex contraflow system
6048260 the cameras measure speed over a distance not like static cameras people have to comply with the speed limit otherwise they get fined 60 and the usual three points go on your licence
6048261 the speed limit is there to protect the workforce as its a dangerous environment
6048262 the safety of road users and our workforce is paramount which is why the speed limit will be policed by speed cameras
6048263 we would be delighted if no motorists were caught speeding
6048264 our sole aim is to ensure everybodys safety and i would like to thank road users for bearing with us
6048265 i am a big believer in winning i dont intend to lose this election
6048266 i dont drink at all and that day i went into the red rum pub and started drinking fosters
6048267 i was taking to a fella who said i should try a double whisky
6048268 by the time the first race came around i had drank seven pints of fosters and six double shots of whisky
6048269 after the first race i went in for another pint and i think it was spiked
6048270 i didnt know where i was and my legs went
6048271 i thought i need to get home i was feeling really bad really ill
6048272 i have written to the race course apologising for my actions
6048273 i was right out of order i really am sorry
6048274 we dont have parking permits and the parking here is horrendous already with the school and the hotel
6048275 there are a lot of student homes so about five cars to one house its not just the customers where are the staff going to park
6048276 it is wrong there is a lot of traffic pollution already and theyll put the local shops out of business and that will change the infrastructure
6048277 i also feel for the people whose gardens are going to be overlooked
6048278 it would be better to move the planned new surgery onto that site instead of losing a green field that children can play on
6048279 no more than 10 to 12 vehicles would be using the car park at any one time
6048280 it is not anticipated that the car borne traffic that it will generate will be as significant as some residents perceive
6048281 everybody heres against it not sainsburys just the location stanwix isnt a village anymore its turning into just like anywhere else there are enough shops in this area weve got morrisons aldi and spar yet theyre desperate for it in the morton area
6048282 it isnt sainsburys that will finish us it is the shoppers themselves who choose where to go we have a very loyal clientele and will fight for as long as we can one man businesses are a rare commodity these days
6048283 the principle of the retail and residential aspect of the proposed development is acceptable

6048290 my brother stole as i believed it my four wheeler and instead of fighting like we usually would do i called 911

6048293 june is always an unusual month in the broadcast calendar because most programming is re runs and summer fare
6048294 however there are still a few big network program finales that dominate the ratings such as the 2 hour finale of lost which lead the top commercials for both total viewership and timeshifted viewership interestingly u s open final golf also placed high in total viewership but is nowhere to be found on the timeshifted viewership as the vast majority of viewing occurred live
6048295 what is particularly impressive is that every commercial in the top 10 for timeshifted viewing aired during the lost season finale in fact the top 86 commercials for timeshifted viewing aired during lost the rank order of the specific commercials continues to demonstrate the choices viewers are making about which commercials to watch the top 5 spots in timeshifted viewing were all for movies with the highest spot getting a 7 7 timeshifted rating the lowest spot from this lost episode got a 2 8 timeshifted rating approximately 64 lower than the audience of the highest rated spot
6048296 its a different field if you will but its no less important
6048297 its a privilege to represent this state particularly we have a great tradition here ted kennedy and going back to john quincy adams
6048298 the fact is john mccain still doesnt think it was a mistake to go to iraq barack obama knows that it was thats judgment
6048299 twelve billion dollars a month a month are being spent in place where there was no al qaida and there were no weapons of mass destruction and the place where there is al qaida and there are weapons of mass destruction pakistan and afghanistan they have ignored sufficiently that its now at great risk

6048308 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously

6048311 the leadership and organizational structure over athletics financial operations show signs of being overextended at a time when the football program is undergoing rapid growth and success
6048312 theyre basically diverting funds that were sold as sponsorships to pay for other things that are not on the books of the university
6048313 this is not the right way to spend public money the money should come to the university and then be allocated from there its inappropriate

6048319 they felt they could manage that amount of water over the next day or two its not a threat
6048320 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6048321 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6048322 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6048323 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6048324 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them
6048325 evangelical christianity is now tragically below the new testament standard worldliness is an accepted part of our way of life our religious mood is social instead of spiritual we have lost the art of worship we are not producing saints our models are successful business men celebrated athletes and theatrical personalities we carry on our religious activities after the methods of the modern advertiser our literature is shallow and our hymnody borders on sacrilege and scarcely anyone appears to care

6048337 our countries poland and the united states will be more secure
6048338 this is sad for europe sad for all in this densely populated continent
6048339 it is a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia
6048340 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6048341 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile attacks from countries like iran or north korea
6048342 were talking about a missile defense system that couldnt possibly be aimed at the russian nuclear deterrent
6048343 russia has thousands of nuclear warheads this is for small missile attacks of the kind that iran might launch

6048366 as such there is no reason that affirmative action cannot be afforded to black staff who otherwise remain disadvantaged thus enabling them to aspire to occupational equality indeed a system could easily be developed in such a way so that it does not work against the interests of white staff for instance by requiring them to resign and replacing them with black staff but also the process would not bar white staff from progression either
6048367 an affirmative action programme should not be defeated by the interest of those few white staff who temporarily lose some privileges surely it is a cost worth paying to achieve a much greater gain overall
6048368 of course there may well be a white backlash but police leaders must now stop the rhetoric of zero tolerance to racism etc and replace it with engagement towards affirming actions
6048369 of course in order to successfully implement lasting change black staff understand that they have to go beyond merely protest groups so again this becomes another call for police leaders to do the right and proper thing to undermine the current structure of relations within the service

6048376 our focus at the denver super rally will be to expand the debates beyond just two parties
6048377 its an issue of central concern to many americans and extends far beyond any one candidate it is a first amendment matter of speech petition and assembly during a presidential election for both the candidates and the voters
6048378 if tens of millions of americans could hear the nader gonzalez message through the presidential debates it would be a three way race
6048379 my apology to ralph nader for not demanding that he be included in the debates
6048380 i met with sean penn and we talked at length
6048381 he was very clear that he is not currently planning to endorse any candidate in the general election but that he has serious concerns about the state of presidential debates he did support kucinich in the primaries and saw how dennis was excluded from msnbc debates

6048387 exploration and discovery has always been more important to the human race than health safety and financial security thats why europeans didnt worry about spreading small pox to native americans when they trekked west across the north american plains and astronauts risk fiery death on space flights and u s voters are considering barack obama for the next president of the united states
6048388 the common cold is boring and having one or curing one doesnt do anything for anybody but blowing holes in the moons surface whether its to find water or just blast the hell out of something in space now thats cool almost makes me think twice about giving iran the bomb and watching them blow the shit out of everything down here
6048389 the aussies are doing something practical with science by curing the common cold a nasty nasal infection that has plagued humankind for centuries
6048390 science needs to spend more time curing and fixing things and less time blowing stuff up there are so many ills in todays world that need a cure it seems like such a shame that we dont spend more time focused on them do you like my lips and boobs most guys do theyre one of my contributions to beautifying the world and making it a better place and i didnt even use explosives to make them look this way a little science sure but no bombs see how science can be used for good

6048401 this scheme would be one of the largest biomass power stations ever built in the u k and would make a considerable contribution to helping the government meet its renewable energy targets

6048403 its more important than anything else as far as im concerned
6048404 we are the global authority on world records and our obligation is to provide the public with the most accurate information possible
6048405 according to our new guidelines leonid stadnyk does not meet the criteria for the evidence required to support his claim which is why we felt that it was only fair to rename bao xi shun whom we have measured in person
6048406 we still hope to hear from stadnyk and anyone else in the world for that matter so we can travel to meet him and officially measure his height
6048407 it is nice to realize that you can compete against your own wife
6048408 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6048409 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6048410 given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6048411 it is very unhelpful and difficult to see why ian jnr is stirring things up apart from trying to remind people he is still here but he has overstepped the mark and his position on the board must be very suspect
6048412 clearly ian paisley jnr hasnt learnt anything from the history of the last 40 years this is the type of corner boy approach to politics we have come to expect from paisley og junior what unionist leaders and in particular the dup need to demonstrate is theyre prepared to share power with nationalists and republicans on the basis of equality rather than appealing to lowest common denominator
6048413 some people shoot from the hip others from the mouth it seems there are two groups of people who want to drive us back into the past the ex provo dissidents and people like ian paisley junior who are still fighting their rearguard action against accountable policing in a shared society
6048414 there is no support among law abiding people for shoot to kill in the past present or future it is precisely because we drew a line under that sort of so called policing that we were able to win such wide cross community support for a new beginning in policing
6048415 it is difficult to think of anything which would serve the dissident cause better than a shoot to kill policy it is also disturbing that we have anyone involved in policing at any level who cant work that out for himself
6048416 there are some crumbs of comfort that the weapons deployment has been botched or else more likely dissidents have been infiltrated and at the last moment the explosives undermined and therefore lives saved
6048417 however we cannot always rely upon infiltration and treachery within the ranks of the dissidents to undermine their activity
6048418 you got to be careful if you dont know where youre going because you might not get there
6048419 unhappiness is best defined as the difference between our talents and our expectations

6048425 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
6048426 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
6048427 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
6048428 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin

6048433 i find this boy sachin yardi brilliant he is a very good writer and a director he has narrated this story in such a way that the film provides a wholesome entertainment besides giving a message when the audience will watch this film their time will pass without their realizing it and todays cinema is about entertainment
6048434 the film is about how this prank played creates situations and incidents which are way beyond the control of the three characters tusshar kapoor anupam kher and rajpal yadav in the film i would also say that their journey begins in a house of 600 square feet and it ends up with them being talked about in the parliament and becoming national heros
6048435 i play the love interest of tusshar kapoor in this film and im playing dons mithun chakraborty sister in our relationship im more dominating one im the chatter box and i keep irritating tusshar that he is a looser and he cant do anything so in the process of the film he goes on to prove to me that he is not such a looser

6048443 the short summer break after the race in budapest has benefited everyone
6048444 now we are embarking on the remaining three european races and four overseas gps with renewed vigour our aim is to continue on from the good results of the first half of the season we still have a few arrows in our quiver and we aim to land one or other hit
6048445 the european grand prix around the port area of valencia is new to the programme this year
6048446 we are very much looking forward to the race and the city particularly as bmw has some close associations with valencia
6048447 the formula bmw racing center there serves as the training site for our up and coming young talent in the formula bmw series around the world
6048448 we are getting somewhere and now we know what is happening we can start prioritising which races we are going to save
6048449 in an ideal world we would save the three group ones the four group twos and hopefully the ebor as well
6048450 we also have the dbs sales race and the consolation race for that is being run at newmarket on saturday so we would also want to find a home for that before the sales next week
6048451 we have spoken to channel 4 about trying to secure coverage at newmarket and or newbury on friday they were already planning to cover racing on friday so it is a case of getting the cameras moved
6048452 it is also possible that we may try to find a home for one of the races next saturday if it makes sense from a race planning point of view to wait that long

6048455 since its inception more than 60 years ago pakistans government and military have with reason regarded india as a moral threat to the countrys survival
6048456 immediately after 9 11 president musharraf allied pakistan with the united states and helped it and nato remove the taliban regime from power thereby wrecking one third of pakistans national security strategy by dethroning a pro pakistan islamist and pashtun dominated afghan government
6048457 at least there has been a payback for pakistan 10 billion dollars in u s aid and the chance for islamabad to buy a new generation of f 16s
6048458 indias strengthening presence in afghanistan puts the pakistani government and military at least in a de facto manner on the same side as the taliban al qaeda and pakistans islamist pashtun organizations
6048459 the tribal agencies of pakistan like bajaur and north and south waziristan are kept by the government as a strategic pool of fighters
6048460 in 2008 alone according to our very conservative estimate the taliban have probably fired 30 million rounds from their kalashnikovs
6048461 hey im a member of the taliban please send hundreds of ak 47s and weapons to my village
6048462 the pakistani army is a very disciplined force and i respect that and there are no rogue elements in the army as is often claimed
6048463 nobody lost control pakistan is staging controlled chaos in order to undermine afghanistans development the pakistani army is very strong and when the government has achieved its aim it will immediately take control again of the tribal areas
6048464 margolis writes that on his subsequent trips to pakistan he was routinely briefed by succeeding isi chiefs
6048465 it still defends pakistan against internal and external subversion by indias powerful spy agency raw and by iran isi works closely with cia and the pentagon and was primarily responsible for the rapid ouster of taliban from power in 2003 but isi also must serve pakistans interests which are often not identical to washingtons and sometimes in conflict
6048466 bribing and arm twisting the subservient musharraf dictatorship into waging war against fellow pakistanis and gravely damaging pakistans national interests
6048467 the isi is trying to restrain pro taliban pashtun tribesmen while dealing with growing us attacks into pakistan that threaten a wider war india has an army of agents in afghanistan and is arming backing and financing the karzai regime in kabul in hopes of turning afghanistan into a protectorate
6048468 pakistans historic strategic interests in afghanistan have been undermined by the us occupation
6048469 washingtons bull in a china shop behaviour pays no heeds to these realities instead washington demonises faithful old allies isi and pakistan while supporting afghanistans communists and drug dealers and allowing india to stir the afghan pot all for the sake of new energy pipelines
6048470 the problem the indian side contends is that by talking to the new civilian government of pakistan it is no longer negotiating with those who have the power to decide between war and peace
6048471 is so far away from the structures the world deals with
6048472 they have to talk to the people who do control this
6048473 the official and other indian and american officials spoke on the condition of anonymity
6048474 in washington american intelligence officials hinted at a new shared worry for india and afghanistan
6048475 the foreign fighter problem in afghanistan and pakistan is growing and we consider non pashtun pakistanis such as elements of formerly kashmiri groups a part of that growing problem
6048476 there is no question that the west is important to the future of the democratic party
6048477 how many people think you are better off than you were eight years ago
6048478 they are going to say he is young and hes got a funny name and hes not patriotic enough weve seen this campaign before it works for republicans because it feeds into the real cynicism that people have about government
6048479 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
6048480 readjustment is not like a light switch that comes on automatically when they get home
6048481 its phenomenal for them to be home but they dont feel connected anymore
6048482 but im doing ok i have my life on track
6048483 i have a couple of buddies in iraq right now and i dont want them coming home to the same problems i had to face
6048484 some of these veterans are truly more afraid of going to college than they were of going to iraq
6048485 given what they have been through they have a very low tolerance for that sort of thing
6048486 the war is not over for them when they come home
6048487 its playing over and over in their minds society seems oblivious to that
6048488 one of the most important things we do is give them a place to get together with people who understand their feelings
6048489 most of them dont understand the idea of picking brains out of your boots things like that
6048490 a lot of these veterans end up going back to the war zone because they need that adrenaline rush and that sense of purpose and they miss the connection with their military buddies
6048491 this acquisition adds further breadth to mantech in the high end intelligence arena and strengthens our position as a leader in cyber security
6048492 the man suffered serious head and chest injuries his passenger was trapped for a while face down in the vehicle
6048493 all we could see was a big cloud of smoke the traffic is horrendous its all backed up way past cosford people are getting out of their cars and walking up and down
6048494 look heres me on a holiday youll never be able to afford ha ha ha
6048495 its been so long that i dont remember having two arms
6048496 i never had the time to sit around and worry about losing an arm
6048497 he was a wonderful neighbor who would do anything for anybody he was a very inventive man he only had one arm and had to learn how to skin that cat many ways we are really going to miss him
6048498 b g used to come in here every day ive known him all my life
6048499 b g got sick with pneumonia during that time and put her in a nursing home until he got well
6048500 he went back and got her and took care of her for years with that one arm he was there for her until she died you dont find many men like that anymore
6048501 i been knowing b g since i was born and im 67 now
6048502 he was a good friend of my husband and me and got to be a better friend the older he got he used to go out and eat supper with us
6048503 b g was a very faithful servant of society hill
6048504 although i didnt serve under him he left a legacy for us to build on he was an outstanding citizen who will really be missed
6048505 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
6048506 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
6048507 im glad david brought it up i think it has a big effect on him we used to play football together on the street
6048508 he saw at first hand the devastation that one night caused
6048509 that blade ruined my life and maybe kids will listen if it is david beckham who is telling them
6048510 just like becks football was my life i lived for nothing else when i wasnt at school i was kicking a ball i was as determined as david was about becoming a professional nothing else mattered
6048511 i was told by orient i had a big future in the game but i was stabbed before i could put pen to paper and it has haunted me ever since
6048512 it was 21 years ago but i remember that night like it was yesterday
6048513 i had been to a school disco with four friends not far from my home in chingford we left just before midnight
6048514 outside a load of youths a bit older than us had come to make trouble and were fighting with another group we walked by but one lad had been badly beaten and was lying in the road
6048515 he was in a really bad way we went and called an ambulance and went back to look after him
6048516 as we were standing i felt what i thought was a punch in the back that was the last thing i remember
6048517 i was out of it for over a week and woke up in a hospital bed i really wasnt sure what had happened and not long after i came round my world was torn apart
6048518 my family had been told id never walk again let alone play football my dad had to break the news to me it was the end of my world
6048519 it felt like someone had dropped a ten ton weight on my chest i burst into tears i thought to myself my life is finished i wanted to die
6048520 when i got home after nearly a year in hospital i couldnt stand the sight of anything that reminded me of football i ripped up my posters and threw away many of my medals and trophies for years id cry when i was reminded of my playing days
6048521 the guy who did this to me got six years and he was out in four but im left with a life sentence
6048522 now im happy to talk about what happened if it stops just one person from being stabbed
6048523 it worries me bringing up my kids in broken britain i know you can be stabbed for absolutely no reason that is really scary there seems to be a total disregard for lives
6048524 all things work together for good to those who love god
6048525 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that

6048544 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6048545 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6048546 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6048547 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6048580 georgian authorities have blocked most access to russian news broadcasters and websites since the outbreak of the conflict with moscow georgias interior ministry said the action was not anti democratic but russian broadcasts could not be allowed to scare our population georgian media private and state owned are generally under the sway of president mikheil saakashvili who promotes his country as a western style democracy however the countrys main opposition television station was shut by the interior ministry at gunpoint in november and some of its equipment was smashed up
6048581 within hours after fighting erupted russian hackers had established a site stopgeorgia ru that showed a list of georgian web sites targeted and which sites had been brought down and allowed visitors to download a simple program to enable their own computers to join the attack
6048582 what frustrates computer security experts is that the features that make the internet such an invaluable resource its openness and interconnectedness also make it easier for hackers to do harm as a staple of 21st century warfare cyberattacks will become increasingly sophisticated forcing governments and private industry to build ever stronger firewalls and other defenses experts said
6048583 internet access in one form or another is being driven into developing nations at an astonishing rate thanks to a combination of philanthropy and profit making pc manufacturers meanwhile already rely on developing markets in china russia india and brazil to drive both growth and profits any effective security policy will have to take such growth into account and plan accordingly at present technological dominance and superior infrastructure may give the united states a decisive edge but history teaches that this edge will inevitably degrade as other countries either catch up or as the threats themselves evolve
6048584 from a domestic perspective the most frightening thing about this whole georgian cyber attack situation isnt that were vulnerable to a similar onslaught of legions of cyber warriors government sponsored or not its that washington doesnt really know what its doing

6048631 coming from a person occupying the responsible post of a minister in a state the remark is deplorable and should be condemned by all the remark should be withdrawn immediately and the minister should tender an unqualified apology to the people of bihar

6048693 the management team of the american cancer societys new england division deserves high praise for realizing that growing their signature fund raising events and increasing their community based patient support programs is directly tied to the ability of their field staff to sell even though the word
6048694 sales training in a nonprofit is unique and catalytic management understood the nature of a nonprofit environment and translated that knowledge into training that will truly drive our mission
6048695 the program is a success because the society gave us full access to their teams before training to gain an in depth understanding of the environment in which the staff must sell the acs mission
6048696 this translated into interactive activity driven sales training that was focused exclusively on the needs of the new england staff as they market sponsorships to corporations and build partnerships for patient support programs at hospitals and clinics
6048697 not for profit organizations are facing an increasingly difficult environment in which to raise funds adopting and successfully practicing the art of selling is critical to their long term survival
6048698 we are pleased to support the new england division of the american cancer society as they continue to build and nurture a unique sales culture as part of their staff development efforts

6048747 in the present case the mdc has not consented to the convening of the parliament
6048748 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the mou and an indication beyond of zanu pfs unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks

6048750 were going to achieve energy independence and were going to do it by using every resource at our disposal to get the job done including new offshore drilling

6048829 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6048830 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6048831 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6048832 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6048833 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6048834 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

6048839 both games are epic rpgs in the same way as
6048840 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6048841 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6048842 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6048843 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6048844 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6048845 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6048846 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6048847 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6048848 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6048849 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6048850 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6048851 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6048852 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6048853 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6048854 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6048855 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6048856 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6048857 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6048858 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6048859 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6048860 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6048861 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6048862 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6048863 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6048864 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6048865 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6048866 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6048867 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6048868 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6048869 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6048870 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6048871 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6048872 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6048873 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6048874 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6048875 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

6048889 quelques d tails restent r gler en vue de lofficialisation du pr t
6048890 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6048891 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6048892 dans la mesure o les professionnels concern s nont en rien modifi leurs m thodes de travail et o les coquillages sont impropres la consommation humaine il appara t que ceux ci ont t atteints par un facteur exog ne constitutif de pollution
6048893 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6048894 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6048895 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6048896 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6048897 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6048898 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6048899 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6048900 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6048901 i will let no one question my love of this country

6048907 the welfare and quality of life of many pedigree dogs is seriously compromised by established breeding practices for appearance driven primarily by the rules and requirements of competitive dog showing and pedigree dog registration
6048908 all those who benefit from pedigree dogs have a collective responsibility to put aside vested interests and work together to ensure the health and welfare of the pedigree dog is protected
6048909 public attitude also needs to change so that the most desirable dogs are those which are fit healthy and well suited to the life they lead pedigree dogs need our help and they need it now
6048910 this is a man made problem that needs an urgent man made solution so lets work together and become the generation thats remembered for saving the pedigree dog

6048913 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6048914 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6048915 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6048916 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6048917 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6048918 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6048919 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6048920 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6048921 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6048922 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6048923 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6048924 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6048925 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6048926 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6048927 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6048928 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6048932 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6048933 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6048934 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6048935 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6048936 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6048937 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6048938 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6048939 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6048940 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6048941 who are open to doing something on the production side
6048942 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6048943 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans

6049013 martial arts student cheng jianghua only saw the army barracks he stayed in and the stadium where he performed at the spectacular olympics opening ceremony but his sacrifices were minor other performers were injured fainted from heatstroke or forced to wear adult diapers so the show could go on
6049014 cheng and 2 200 other carefully chosen pugilist prodigies spent an average of 16 hours a day every day rehearsing a synchronized tai chi routine involving high kicks sweeping lunges and swift punches they lived for three months in trying conditions at a restricted army camp on the outskirts of beijing
6049015 in the most extreme case beijing organizers revealed last week that liu yan a 26 year old dancer was seriously injured during a july rehearsal shanghai media reported that she fell from a 10 foot stage and may be permanently paralyzed from the waist down
6049016 while in beijing the constant exposure to the dizzyingly hot summer resulted in heatstroke for some students particularly during one rain drenched rehearsal that stretched on for two days and two nights
6049017 the students were kept on their feet for most of the 51 hour rehearsal with little food and rest and no shelter from the nights downpour as the shows directors attempted to coordinate the 2 008 member performance with multimedia effects students and their head coach told the ap
6049018 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
6049019 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time

6049065 we do think that flash is the technology being abused
6049066 because it does have a facility to put content into peoples clipboards
6049067 the attackers have somehow managed to insert malicious adverts into the system
6049068 if youre in an instant message conversation with someone and they say heres that link i was talking about youre more likely to believe its legitimate its very cunning
6049069 when i say taking over my clipboard i mean it appears on my clipboard and cant be removed
6049070 whenever i paste thats what gets pasted if i copy something else and then paste whatever i copied isnt actually copied and that string is what gets pasted
6049071 if someone replies to an e mail they paste from the clipboard and get the url maybe they catch it maybe not likewise with blog posts guestbooks comments facebook etc theyre hoping that when you paste you paste their crap and it gets through
6049072 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
6049073 first company to provide unified security management for both physical networks and virtual applications
6049074 strengthens auditing compliance and risk management with unified logging for the entire security infrastructure including virtual environments
6049075 many organizations mistakenly assume that their approach for securing virtual machines will be the same as securing any operating system and thus plan to apply their existing configuration guidelines standards and tools while this is a start simply applying the technologies and best practices for securing physical servers wont provide sufficient protection

6049077 it is not appropriate that the president entrust an important governmental post to a man who does not have the courage to admit to his mistake and apologise

6049080 theres as much likelihood of that happening as there being commercial space flights
6049081 when we saw him crying we knew it was over
6049082 the concern is that the crown needs to recognise that others have rights and they need to demonstrate how those rights can be accommodated so theyre in discussions with raukawa and also te arawa that have interests on the waikato river particularly ngati tahu from the reporoa area and we want to make sure that ngati koroki kahukura is a part of those discussions as well
6049083 counties manukaus population is going to be roughly a quarter european a quarter asian a quarter maori and a quarter pacific we can move towards that by making sure these sorts of innovations and opportunities are based out here in south auckland
6049084 it just made to me so much more sense sitting in the marae it was just so powerful and strong and i thought if we could have those programmes after school in the summer school holidays in the marae itself that would be a really great way of sending out a signal that maori people want things to change
6049085 it is a disgrace she has been ranked lower than two first time mps and she is an ex cabinet minister im shocked they have ranked her below those other three who have nowhere near her experience or mana
6049086 this kind of tongue in cheek aspect that comes with the t shirts horiwear being one of the good examples in turning what has always been a negative stereotype into a postive there was a lot more staunchness right down to your tribal t shirts when everyone has their te arawa or their ngapuhi or whatever so there was all that kind of pride
6049087 if we didnt have this the marae would fall to rack and ruin because all the marae makes at the moment is just enough to pay for the wear and tear of the buildings and the upkeep me and my wife work for nothing but everyone else gets wages but what we do is put the money back into the upkeep of the marae and thats just the way it is
6049088 prices went down a lot in both areas but they fell a lot more in los angeles
6049089 prices are declining very rapidly in california because of a large supply and low demand

6049095 it gives them a story in customer service they have something already but its not as sophisticated as this
6049096 note that this is not a product launch or announcement but is a demonstration of what we think an intel atom processor should do in a product targeting users who need the ultimate in mobile productivity
6049097 part of its success is due to microsoft helping it but part of it is also due to novells own efforts
6049098 i consider my rules much more readable and elegant than yours
6049099 we thought wed grow five times not 20 times thats a nice surprise for traffic but maybe not such a pleasant surprise for the cost structure
6049100 we had already positioned ourselves with mainstream and healthy content from day one
6049101 if youre purely user generated then to be honest you may have a lot of racy content and brand advertisers are very wary and uncomfortable
6049102 we would need to do high definition hd to have an online subscription model
6049103 generic content is the scourge of this sector so their ability to sign up original content deals is key
6049104 its major challenge is how to increase the user experience and add user interactivity to its services a video on demand like business is not the key selling point of video sharing and user loyalty for such services is not high youku cannot effectively grow merely by adding more content it needs to think of offering more services to compete with other online video companies
6049105 weve seen these isolated reports about people having connectivity issues with 3g and edge and frankly i have those issues on a variety of phones
6049106 we have already made many improvements to mobileme but we still have many more to make
6049107 we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour
6049108 get to know each other when they meet in person instead of having to deal with the nitty gritty details of building a relationship
6049109 ik ben op straat beroofd door drie mannen die met een mes op me afkwamen
6049110 tot nu toe zijn er maar weinig mensen die dit weten zelfs mijn ouders heb ik het niet verteld
6049111 ik kom niet graag op straat en zie mijn huis als laatste veilige haven als mensen mij onverwachts aanraken schrik ik
6049112 er zijn zichtbare en onzichtbare littekens die mij elke dag aan het voorval herinneren

6049115 de economische dynamiek zou de komende maanden wat ingetogen kunnen zijn

6049119 i think defence is the strongest position in the squad
6049120 if someone is doing well it just raises the competition
6049121 i know the reasons im not going to go and make them public
6049122 i will need to speak to one or two but as a team in general we need to roll the sleeves up get back to basics regroup and say right were not a good side
6049123 but were going to work hard to be a good side
6049124 its a huge blow to lose jody hes broken his metatarsal and could be out for three months
6049125 its knocked me back one but darren ward is still here thats something that will have to be addressed
6049126 hes playing today at wigan in a reserve game but with jody out that lessens his chance of going but it suits darren fine i would think
6049127 dan understands the game and can play he is an exciting player who puts a smile on peoples faces we will see how he does for the rest of the week in training and take it from there
6049128 dan arrived last weekend and has trained with us for the last three days
6049129 he knows how to play football but it is understanding coming to a different culture and a different country to play
6049130 i have to see if his size is suitable for our game as you have to be physical in scotland
6049131 die trainingsinhalte grenzen an k rperverletzung f nf minuten handstand und wer am ende die zeit unter schmerzen nicht noch herunterz hlt bekommt rger in form anderer qu lereien
6049132 we are getting somewhere and now we know what is happening we can start prioritising which races we are going to save
6049133 in an ideal world we would save the three group ones the four group twos and hopefully the ebor as well
6049134 we also have the dbs sales race and the consolation race for that is being run at newmarket on saturday so we would also want to find a home for that before the sales next week
6049135 we have spoken to channel 4 about trying to secure coverage at newmarket and or newbury on friday they were already planning to cover racing on friday so it is a case of getting the cameras moved
6049136 it is also possible that we may try to find a home for one of the races next saturday if it makes sense from a race planning point of view to wait that long
6049137 the short summer break after the race in budapest has benefited everyone
6049138 now we are embarking on the remaining three european races and four overseas gps with renewed vigour our aim is to continue on from the good results of the first half of the season we still have a few arrows in our quiver and we aim to land one or other hit
6049139 the european grand prix around the port area of valencia is new to the programme this year
6049140 we are very much looking forward to the race and the city particularly as bmw has some close associations with valencia
6049141 the formula bmw racing center there serves as the training site for our up and coming young talent in the formula bmw series around the world

6049146 kendra wilkinson has been offered her own reality show about starting her life over again when she moves out of the playboy mansion hugh hefner knows her time is coming
6049147 no question it is a lower level but if we dont do that a future board will say sorry we cant afford it
6049148 we have not found a way to resolve the issue without disadvantaging retirees
6049149 if we dont make a fiscally responsible decision now the overwhelming credit card balance will come due
6049150 im sorry to say i have little respect for the county leadership
6049151 you have lost the trust of the employees and retirees and you risk losing the trust of the public
6049152 it is not a popular comment but when we look at the unfunded liabilities
6049153 is not only fair but is on the generous side
6049154 most of the taxpayers that are funding this package do not get the same thing
6049155 load all the kids on an airplane and hope for the best trip
6049156 its not up to us to make a decision if your kid is in a gang
6049157 we cant have a presence of gangs on campus we have to be fair and equitable
6049158 now you are not talking about someones physical features that way
6049159 it makes it a nice and easy thing to do so theres no more well look at her
6049160 now its like navy blue shorts i cant wear something to school that i would have never ever associated with a gang
6049161 it is found to be effective in certain schools because it takes away that level of intimidation
6049162 but just because you see someone out there wearing red or blue doesnt mean they are in a gang
6049163 because our school color is red you cant just say you cant wear red
6049164 we look at the child as a whole are shoelaces crossed four times or red hair braids crossed four times we look at the whole thing and then we make a decision
6049165 when we get into that gray area that gives us another opportunity to make a parent contact
6049166 even if you are not connected to it there are kids who might think you are and it becomes an issue
6049167 the color thing represents violence and thats what makes me sad
6049168 of course you dont want to think that in this little town they have this problem but its a fact its everywhere
6049169 jesus agenda is far bigger than just one or two issues we have to care about poverty we have to care about disease we have to care about illiteracy we have to care about corruption in government sex trafficking
6049170 if obama ever establishes any kind of trust with evangelicals there will be a noticeable shift
6049171 it will not be huge but it will be significant
6049172 number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
6049173 the encouraging thing is that in 2004 we didnt have any part in the platform discussion
6049174 this time the party wanted us as a partner in the process they reached out to us and wanted to hear what we had to say
6049175 we do see throughout the nation this movement for locally produced food
6049176 this is a small way for the city to make it less onerous for people who want to produce their own eggs and to keep hens and rabbits
6049177 if everybody kept three chickens for every person in the household we would change the nature of this country
6049178 i dont know the noise level of 16 hens or one rooster i dont know the health effects if there will be flies and other insects
6049179 does that person coming from san francisco or another state want to have these animals next door and then do i have to go to my police department to enforce the code and how much time is that going to take
6049180 they were colorful a little bit of residual agricultural texture
6049181 there were some problems i dont know if the kids were chasing them or they were chasing the kids but we dont want kids hurt
6049182 we are not talking about commercial endeavors in backyards but being able to have your own homegrown eggs and it seems in keeping with some of the goals we have established in society
6049183 the issues are noise smell and people have different levels of ability to care for animals they have rights as well
6049184 i imagine the vandalism is a show of frustration from someone who feels powerless about the loss of access
6049185 theyre not stopping horses theyre not stopping hikers theyre not stopping walkers theyre just stopping bicycles
6049186 wasnt called for and will only add fuel to the wound

6049188 the war within a secret white house history 2006 2008
6049189 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers
6049190 this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
6049191 takes readers deep inside the white house the pentagon the state department the intelligence agencies and the u s military headquarters in iraq
6049192 based on extensive interviews with participants contemporaneous notes and secret documents the book traces the internal debates tensions and critical turning points in the iraq war during an extraordinary two year period
6049193 they knew our guys were in trouble and when the airbornes in trouble you dont leave them to die you go help them
6049194 its like one of the those movies out of like vietnam that you see with all these special effects and everythings on fire
6049195 smoke in the air and thats all you see is tracer rounds going back and forth just boom boom boom
6049196 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
6049197 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
6049198 the ground is so hard here because were in a drought and when the rain came down so fast it just flooded
6049199 todays bombing is very symbolic a pillar of the regime has been hit
6049200 i dont recall anything as big since the decade of the civil war
6049201 for extremists to target police is like hitting a symbol of repression it can help them rally a segment of the population
6049202 there were bodies scattered all over the road some corpses were completely charred you couldnt even recognize their faces
6049203 we support the government of algeria as best we can in trying to fight this

6049233 interest rate cuts and stimulus checks are helping ease the pain
6049234 but in the area stretching from the oilfields of texas north to the dakotas where the economy is holding up fairly well those government actions may prove unnecessary and even contribute to new bubbles
6049235 the housing market is holding up just fine the banks are making plenty of loans and employers keep adding jobs
6049236 retail spending in the middle of the country was strong even before the 600 tax rebates this spring and low interest rates and a tax provision in the economic stimulus bill are helping to goose already booming sales of farm equipment and pickup trucks the price of farmland in nebraska has doubled in the past three years primarily reflecting the boom in commodity prices the increase also reflects the impact of rate cuts by the federal reserve that enabled buyers to bid up land with borrowed money but if crop prices drop toward historical norms it could mean sharp decreases in land prices that would devastate some farmers
6049237 the biggest risk is the interest rates if they swing up higher it makes it much harder for a farmer to keep paying the debt

6049246 unlike their counterparts in the un contingent the nigerian soldiers had to fend for themselves
6049247 as they faced a threat of being declared awol in the various units of the army they protested peacefully for payment of their withheld entitlements it was at this stage that the sum of u 5 040 was reluctantly paid to each of them

6049314 and being afraid to take responsibility for things you have done and instead foisting upon the rest of us pathetic banalities because you dont have the courage to look at the world you have created
6049315 yes i think the fact is if you look at the amount of violence we have in games that young people play at 7 8 10 12 15 years of age if you look at the dehumanization if you look at the fact that we refuse to say that we are in fact endowed by our creator that our rights come from god that if you kill somebody youre committing an act of evil

6049330 its something weve been talking about although its not something we have taken any investment decisions on yet
6049331 its difficult to tell what an obama administration would actually mean if you had protectionism with manufactured goods that would affect countries such as china most but if you had agricultural goods protectionism that would be more damaging to latin america
6049332 obama is clearly seen as more protectionist and that would definitely be a negative for emerging markets
6049333 mccain would be seen as more hardline in terms of foreign policy particularly regards the middle east
6049334 you might expect to have a lower oil price with obama in the longer term and the question will be whether that would offset any protectionism
6049335 india at the moment is not so exposed to the us
6049336 they have to say things like that to win the election
6049337 the sceptical case has been ignored by the press till now and i think youll find it very strong people are finally coming to terms with it now
6049338 it seemed the situation got beyond stupid and our decision makers need to be reminded that the science has changed since the last 10 years
6049339 the ipcc is a un bureaucracy less than half of the 2500 involved are scientists most are bureaucrats the ipcc is reluctant to consider causes of global warming other than human ones the fact that temperatures havent risen since 2001 means that their politics are becoming untenable
6049340 co2 is not pollution co2 is beneficial to plants and doesnt seem to have a significant effect on the earths temperature i agree that the government should be regulating the earths pollution but its a different question than global warming
6049341 co2 is good for plants we humans have been digging co2 out from under the desert in saudi arabia and efficiently distributing it across the planet plants need carbon to grow in fact they need it more than water satellite data shows that over the last 2 decades the amount of plant biomass on the planet has increased by 6 percent so increasing the co2 levels is helping feed the planet not only is co2 not pollution but it is beneficial to all plants and most animals on the planet
6049342 the last 7 years has seen a period of flat temperatures with a small downward bias its too early to say temperatures are dropping even in the last year they have dropped a little were looking here for temperature trends which typically exhibit themselves over 5 years or so so i think its safer to say that temperatures have levelled out since 2001 the correlation with solar activities are very interesting bear in mind that they are only correlation and nothing has been proven however the late appearance solar cycle 24 suggest the next 24 years or so might be a little cooler
6049343 the sun affects the earths temperature in two ways firstly there can be changes in solar eradiation meaning the amount of heat pumped out by the sun people have observed slight variation over the decades secondly and probably more significantly the sun effects cloud formation on earth through solar magnetic effects high energy cosmic rays strike the earth and help create clouds and those clouds had a cooling effect on the earth but the suns magnetic shields us from some of those high energy cosmic rays so when the sun is active the earth gets less high energy cosmic rays so there are fewer clouds and it gets warmer the sun has been pretty active in the last few decades this theory still hasnt been proven and is just at the stage of correlations there are probably half a dozen likely influences on the global temperature and at this stage i dont know of any good evidence to know which are the important ones except to say that because the signature is missing we can pretty much rule out carbon emissions
6049344 its important to see that solar activity does not correlate with nasa giss temperatures because they come from land based thermometers and are corrupted by the urban land heat effects however solar activities correlate very well with satellite temperatures right up to 2008
6049345 its quite possible that we humans have no effect on temperature and all were seeing is natural variation bear in mind that it was warmer in the medieval times 800 years ago and it was a couple of degrees cooler in the 1700s when they had a mini ice age humanity generally flourish when it is hotter so personally i regard a little bit of heating as a good thing
6049346 we dont know what causes global warming except that we now are pretty sure that carbon emissions do not cause it therefore taking measures to decrease our carbon emissions wont have any significant effect
6049347 many of the crucial issues in global warming are pretty simple well within the grasp of any educated citizen such as the prime minister you only need a high school education to be able to read a temperature graph and to see that the temperatures have been flat since 2001 you only have to be vaguely aware of the debate to notice that the alarmist are offering no actually evidence only results from computer models these are things that any political or journalist should feel confident in doing i urge our prime minister to spend a little more time investigating the issue himself instead of just relying on the advice of peoples whose jobs depend on the belief that carbon emission cause global warming
6049348 this issue will get sorted out because its an issue of science no amount of human arguing and can affect the actual effects of global warming and it will be another 2 3 decades of research before we will probably have a definitive answer as to what causes global warming stay tuned

6049378 these together with fiscal discipline and transparency can make a lot of difference to the poor communities a nation like nigeria with its huge energy resource has every prospect to transform the lives of not just a few but of all of your people
6049379 we have a strong regulatory regime and we dialogue about fiscal and other matters we believe that there is every prospect of any country working well with iocs for the benefit of the people of the country and not just the iocs i think there are things we can learn from one another and maybe after the meeting we can think of some steps forward so that we can work in collaboration that will be in the interest of both countries

6049411 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6049412 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6049413 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6049414 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6049415 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6049429 i think we have gelled nicely as a team not just the attack that is why we are having success
6049430 it was just a minor change but it seems to have helped the boys come together nicely as a team
6049431 it was only a matter of time before colin became comfortable playing the outdoor game i think he is more comfortable playing closer to the goal as that is just like the indoor game in which he has been one of the best players year after year
6049432 i would say our style is definitely influenced by that the majority of our goals are assisted and within five yards of the net
6049433 having an all canadian attack is unique and i think each guy contributes in their own way
6049434 moving casey up to midfield has been huge when he comes flying out of the box its tough to stop him and this forces slides which creates offense
6049435 as simple as it is it is unstoppable i think we have a unique style unlike any other mll team
6049436 when we share the ball on offense things can get pretty fancy and fun to watch
6049437 our offense functions by putting pressure on the weak points in opposing defenses
6049438 we dont rely on pre selected individuals to create draw and dump situations like most offenses ive seen
6049439 we have taken some heat for our penalty minutes this season
6049440 you cant allow easy goals in this league and its my opinion that shooters need to pay for their shots if this ruffles some peoples feathers oh well i dont like the idea of my goalie holding his pipe as an attackman dives in and around his knees
6049441 while it certainly isnt illegal in the mll shooters should know that their chance at highlight reel goals comes with a price
6049442 lends to a run n gun style of lacrosse the way this game and this league is supposed to be played
6049443 it gives fans a chance to see two contrasting styles of goalie play that have produced solid results and it gives us two different looks as a defense
6049444 levin a righty is an experienced keeper that is a solid communicator and doesnt unravel during tough stretches queener a lefty has unbelievable quickness that allows him to literally catch up to shots along with an energetic personality that is contagious stylistically speaking i think the fact that they are close to polar opposites is an enormous advantage as it seems to take an offense some time to adapt to the switch
6049445 at strategic locations just make sure not overdo some are even using anchor texts which is also an effective method
6049446 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6049447 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6049448 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
6049449 you can double quit rates with a telephone quitline and a free patch
6049450 older smokers are motivated to quit and that quitlines and pharmacotherapy greatly increase the odds of successfully quitting
6049451 what we dont know is how much money this really saves if saving money is your goal
6049452 if you just look at it from a strict budget perspective its not going to save medicare a lot one way or another
6049453 no credible evidence that airborne products taken as directed will reduce the severity or duration of colds or provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places
6049454 twelve billion dollars a month a month are being spent in place where there was no al qaida news and there were no weapons of mass destruction and the place where there is al qaida and there are weapons of mass destruction pakistan and afghanistan they have ignored sufficiently that its now at great risk
6049455 im smart enough to know that in this new way that congress works you very rarely get the slot where you can bring a bill that has your own name on it to the floor
6049456 usually youre trying to attach something to something else to get it passed
6049457 take my photo again and i might strangle you with the camera strap
6049458 restricts a persons freedom of choice of private health care systems or private plans of any type
6049459 we just think that health care reform has to have the rights that we lay out in our initiative as protected
6049460 health care reform can be built on top of these rights
6049461 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
6049462 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your head to be professional
6049463 its tragic and im very sad what happened to those young boys
6049464 i dont think our troops should be there there is no solution for this country
6049465 its a shock an emotional blast but after one two or three days until after the ceremony tomorrow the people will forget
6049466 in my mind there is no question about the need to be in afghanistan its about september 11th its a pity for these men but it can be seen as the result of a war it happened once for us it happens many times for american soldiers
6049467 we were asked to come up and give a general overview on the oilsands and canadas role in the world of energy in general which we did
6049468 they were exercising curiosity basically saying wow this is neat
6049469 its astounding to me frankly the calibre of these individuals to just seem to arrive quietly in our community
6049470 browse through history using daily maps of historical news events and milestones
6049471 hey while browsing the internet one day i found this very funny webcomic you should totally check it out
6049472 the nation pays tribute to the memory of your 10 comrades
6049473 they fulfilled their duties to the fullest and it cost them their lives which reminds us that being a soldier is a job like no other
6049474 the cause is just it is an honor for france and its armies to defend them
6049475 reinforced with quick reaction forces close air support and mobile medical teams
6049476 r eputation in a community arising before the controversy as to boundaries of or customs affecting lands in the community and reputation as to events of general history important to the community or state or nation in which located
6049477 t rustworthiness in reputation evidence is found when the topic is such that the facts are likely to have been inquired about and that persons having personal knowledge have disclosed facts which have thus been discussed in the community and thus the communitys conclusion if any has been formed is likely to be a trustworthy one
6049478 i hid near him if i feel frightened ill always run to him tonys a friendly giant but i wouldnt mess with him
6049479 dannii was really shaken by the whole experience so it was decided to have a few more heavies on set just in case something as traumatic happened again
6049480 producers appreciate things get heated on occasion but they never anticipated things would kick off quite as much
6049481 it was quite eye opening to say the least for fellow judge cheryl cole who had never seen a confrontation quite like that on the show before
6049482 she gave dannii a kiss and a cuddle afterwards to make sure she was ok but was trembling quite alot herself
6049483 a nun seeking god through the monastic way of life under a rule and a superior
6049484 i try and read the blog everyday and have pointed it out to other faculty who have their students read it for class it is truly one of the best things in the blogosphere
6049485 i think there was a rather remarkable shift in some of the ways data was interpreted
6049486 we believe it needs to be in a fire resistant enclosure which it is
6049487 i dont know any hospital in the country that doesnt have hanging hazards
6049488 it is a serious event and were taking it seriously
6049489 we are very concerned that an incident like this would have occurred our deepest concern is about patient care
6049490 disciplinary actions have been taken to emphasize that attentive quality patient care is the essential responsibility for every employee
6049491 we know this is do or die no one can beat us when we play together were our best friend or our worst enemy

6049498 to be a kashmiri was to value what was shared far more highly than what divided
6049499 i love the indian people as i love none other and my heart and my mind have long been laid on the alter of the motherland
6049500 after a study of some forty years and more of the great religions of the world i find none so perfect none so scientific none so philosophic and none so spiritual as the great religion known by the name of hinduism the more you know it the more you will love it the more you try to understand it the more deeply you will value it

6049512 i am totally overwhelmed with the response we have had this year
6049513 yes it was a dummy you all saw it it was for the baby that is coming
6049514 i dedicated the goal to gianinna and to all my family watching at home i miss them a lot
6049515 im very proud of having a son in law who can score two goals against brazil and then gets fouled in the box for a penalty
6049516 i had very hard moments but now i wake up every morning lucid and willing to call my daughters im great
6049517 you think how music has changed in the last 50 years and we would have none of that mixture of music and culture if the likes of the bnp had their way
6049518 so we thought rather than do the event in sheffield we would do it in rotherham and say to these people we dont want you here we dont want your fascist shit

6049534 negotiations to exploit divisions in the rebel factions that are controlling the south of the country
6049535 what is regrettable is that these decisions were made without national debate almost on the sly
6049536 they were not well received by public opinion which saw in them an alignment with washington and also a futile threat to soldiers lives not without reason as the ambush has demonstrated
6049537 we should ask ourselves whether this force is uncovering the violence or creating it
6049538 they seem to be paying a forfeit to their great american ally for not participating in the iraqi adventure
6049539 la sensazione di amarezza per unopportunit persa sapevamo sarebbe stato difficile farcela durante la partita lottando palla dopo palla stavamo mettendo le fondamenta di un buon risultato ma alla fine non siamo stati capaci di premere sullacceleratore quando era necessario gli stati uniti giocano sempre ad alto livello anche quando non sono in ottima condizione dal quarto set hanno cominciato a esprimesi bene avvantaggiandosi dei nostri errori e sfruttando le loro potenzialit che hanno usato per aggiudicarsi le ultime due frazioni
6049540 abbiamo fatto bene noi e gli u s a nei primi tre set poi i nostri errori si sono rivelati fatali ancora non riesco a capacitarmi di come possa essere successo una partita che non sar facile dimenticare
6049541 avevamo vissuto unesperienza analoga ad atene nel 2004 sono trascorsi quattro anni e siamo nuovamente state eliminate nei quarti la tristezza tanta
6049542 nessuna di noi sa cosa sia successo fatto che dal quarto set in poi non siamo pi riuscite a giocare come avevamo fatto in precedenza

6049580 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt

6049726 im smart enough to know that in this new way that congress works you very rarely get the slot where you can bring a bill that has your own name on it to the floor

6049729 the agreement is not a cartel nobody is forced into anything we just recommend that licensees dont sell beer for less than 1 or bottles for less than 1 50 and that there is no need for drinks promotions at weekends
6049730 its up to licensees though but they are all in business for a reason so selling cheap alcohol makes no sense
6049731 in the mid 90s licensees were offering crazy deals and the city was carnage we dont need to go back to that
6049732 if self regulation is illegal and there is no legislation in place then licensees can lower prices as much as they want that will lead to more violence or sexual offences if that happens out in the street we cant take action against licensees

6049750 i can be cheated but one cannot cheat the people i can walk tall before the people we have taken the decision to withdraw support to the koda government for the people and were appreciated for it
6049751 it is the last alternative and comes only after a party invited by the governor fails to form a government but now the governor has asked the koda government to prove its majority in the floor of the house after that we will stake claim
6049752 we dont pass on the entire burden onto the consumers every time the atf prices go up so it is highly unlikely that we will reduce the airfares this month but it also depends on the quantum of atf price reduction
6049753 even if atf prices are reduced we will hold on to the current fares for a month if the prices come down next month also then we will reduce the fares
6049754 we would fix the passenger fares in a day or two after the atf price revision
6049755 just last week we introduced lower advance purchase fares and various special offers for example on the delhi mumbai sector if as expected the atf price is revised downward in the coming months then we would expect to see some additional fare reductions
6049756 we received a letter last week from the lieutenant governor appealing to us to take steps to increase security around religious places during the festival season especially on occasions when there are large crowds
6049757 the letter said that terror outfits are making religious places their easy targets and steps should be taken to ensure security at temples mosques and gurdwaras
6049758 we have increased the demand for security personnel this year and have asked for 3 000 police staff including women cops round the clock on janmashtami
6049759 its good that people have understood the problem caused by the economic policies of the central government and have supported our call for the strike it was a total shutdown
6049760 the trade union movement by the left parties will further continue in the country

6049762 no that is not true we have not pulled out of the champions trophy but we have advised the icc about our considerable concern and we have made sure that they understand that we will not go anywhere which is not safe we are waiting to hear from them later this evening

6049764 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe
6049765 reports appearing in the media about the police probing how monica got a role in the reality show were baseless
6049766 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6049767 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6049768 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6049769 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6049770 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6049794 the jetport commission feels that the county council is not willing to listen to the advice of the commission on matters affecting the aeronautics the operation of the county jetport and the jetport facilities
6049795 we feel that we cannot work under these conditions therefore as of this date we must give our resignation
6049796 we understand that we are only an advisory committee and have no decision making power
6049797 however we ask that the council give us the opportunity to present our recommendation before making a decision to act on matters concerning the jetport
6049798 without open communication between the council and the board you might as well do away with the jetport advisory commission
6049799 as pilots we feel that we have a good idea of what improvements are needed to move the jetport forward
