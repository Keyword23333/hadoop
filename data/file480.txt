4800053 therefore the federal government through the ministry of interior is vicariously liable for the circumstances that led to the deaths of these nigerians and must pay damages and compensations for the aggravated losses suffered by the surviving family members who have lost their bread winners and for the victims of the recruitment stampedes who sustained various degrees of injuries during the recruitment exercises into the nigerian immigration service
4800054 why should the chairman of a panel set up by the ministry of interior display this brazen attitude of biasness even before the panel submits its findings to the federal government

4800075 preserving the territorial integrity of georgia will not be possible without preserving the territorial integrity of serbia in kosovo and metohija province
4800076 it is unacceptable to recognize the unilateral independence of kosovo province from serbia and at the same time keep repeating the territorial integrity of georgia must be respected when it comes to south ossetia and abkhazia
4800077 if we all respect the territorial integrity of serbia in regards to its kosovo province then we are also going to honor the territorial integrity of georgia but if someone doesnt respect serbias territorial integrity and sovereignty over kosovo and metohija then they better shut up about the territorial integrity of georgia
4800078 hello im john mccain of arizona and ive come for your water
4800079 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
4800080 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
4800081 i wonder if he is running for president of the united states or for something in arizona when he makes those statements
4800082 im really kind of surprised that someone running for president that needs to carry the state of colorado would make a statement like that
4800083 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body

4800086 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up
4800087 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
4800088 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue

4800139 we didnt get off to a great start with them scoring early in the game and they are a great side
4800140 but once we got a grip of the game we gave a decent account of ourselves although they had about 20 opportunities and we probably only created one or two ourselves
4800141 we had a few problems down the right side and they capitalised on that but once we sorted out the problems we performed a lot better
4800142 i am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo impressed i read and reread sections just poring over the word pictures i really really really like this aspect of the writing on this one i shall return to the story now and see what happens but i can tell you now this is word wise dont know about the plot definitely the best

4800146 i am sceptical about socialism in general i dont see that socialism offers some kind of new theoretical plan so to speak for the better organization of society we have the same kind of problems that is crime and personal alienation that are to be found in the capitalist world but our society represents an extreme case with maximum restraint maximum ideological restrictions and so forth moreover and very characteristically we are also the most pretentious that is although we are not the best society we pretend that we are much more
4800147 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately

4800151 hello im john mccain of arizona and ive come for your water
4800152 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
4800153 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource

4800158 we did not want california to gobble up all of the water supply on the colorado river and they would have done that under the doctrine of equitable apportionment
4800159 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up
4800160 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
4800161 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
4800162 it is impossible to transplant a heart successfully after irreversible stoppage if a heart is restarted the person from whom it was taken cannot have been dead according to cardiac criteria removing organs from a patient whose heart not only can be restarted but also has been or will be restarted in another body is ending a life by organ removal
4800163 on any given day between 2 2 and 10 6 children will die with about half on life support systems
4800164 a childs death can be anticipated and considered within a family centered end of life care plan which can include the possibility of donation after withdrawal of life support and subsequent circulatory or cardiac death
4800165 the appropriate period of observation after the cessation of cardiocirculatory function and before the declaration of death has not been established we initially used a 3 minute period after loss of cardiac function this time was based on a recommendation of 2 minutes in the critical care literature after the first donation the ethics committee recommended a period of observation of 1 25 minutes to reduce the risk of injury from warm ischemia
4800166 this bold experiment is pushing the boundaries and raising many questions
4800167 were trying to deal with a very difficult situation where children die waiting for transplant and parents of other children want to donate
4800168 the whole issue is whether the infants from whom the hearts were taken were dead it seems very clear to me that they were not
4800169 i think its illegal and if its illegal what were talking about is the physicians causing the death of the three patients and that would be homicide its immoral i think it should be stopped
4800170 the definition of brain death requires the complete absence of all functions of the entire brain yet many of these patients retain essential neurologic function such as the regulated secretion of hypothalamic hormones some have argued that these patients are dead because they are permanently unconscious which is true but if this is the justification then patients in a permanent vegetative state who breathe spontaneously should also be diagnosed as dead a characterization that most regard as implausible
4800171 others have claimed that brain dead patients are dead because their brain damage has led to the permanent cessation of functioning of the organism as a whole yet evidence shows that if these patients are supported beyond the acute phase of their illness which is rarely done they can survive for many years the uncomfortable conclusion to be drawn from this literature is that although it may be perfectly ethical to remove vital organs for transplantation from patients who satisfy the diagnostic criteria of brain death the reason it is ethical cannot be that we are convinced they are really dead
4800172 this creates the paradox that the hearts of patients who have been declared dead on the basis of the irreversible loss of cardiac function have in fact been transplanted and have successfully functioned in the chest of another again although it may be ethical to remove vital organs from these patients we believe that the reason it is ethical cannot convincingly be that the donors are dead
4800173 will die from vital organ donation who would not otherwise die as a result of the withdrawal of life support
4800174 surely definitions should not be changed simply to make hearts available
4800175 a good case can be made for letting those whose values support such a definition choose to have it applied to them
4800176 it is great to see meier doing well we are all routing for her and wish her the best of luck in representing not only her country but nicholls as well

4800505 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4800506 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4800507 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4800508 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4800509 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4800510 we would have liked to move ahead with the project

4800571 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4800572 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4800573 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4800574 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4800575 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4800576 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4800577 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4800578 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4800579 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4800580 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4800581 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4800582 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4800583 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4800584 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4800585 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4800586 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4800587 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4800588 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4800589 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4800590 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4800591 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4800592 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4800593 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4800594 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4800595 all ive got to do is look at the prescription and authorize it and its done
4800596 in the old days we always had issues where patients would take the prescription probably go home and leave the prescription in a drawer for a few days a few weeks maybe never fill it
4800597 there is going to be a lot less dispensing errors and a lot less medication errors both on the doctors side and the pharmacists side
4800598 i dont have to wait around or bring the prescription or come back time is key
4800599 things get pretty hard and hectic at around 100 200 000 so its definitively not a game you play to stress down

4800603 today we are trying to help the people with the critical diseases that need help to define their disease and provide any kind of help we can to them
4800604 this is very important because rawah is so far from the central government and even the central government doesnt have the equipment needed for some of the specific treatment s today we can help identify what type of special treatment the people need and try to help them
4800605 our role here was to facilitate the medical engagement by providing the supplies and the security for the area
4800606 it went well the people were able to come and get some basic medication and they have been given the chance to go get some water and some basic hygiene equipment
4800607 the plan is we are going to try to help the people that are not able to get medicine and the critically sick patients who cannot receive the treatment
4800608 it has been very successful we are trying to keep record of the people who are critically ill and the ones who are not so serious
4800609 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces
4800610 georgia is a member of the united nations and south ossetia and abkhazia lie within its internationally recognized borders

4800612 a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
4800613 i knew i wanted to go in with supreme confidence in my abilities and not doubting myself one second thats what i did and i wrestled the match of my life and it was awesome
4800614 it was a tough race we tried to ignore the fact that we havent had a medal yet as a country and just focus on our two kilometres
4800615 we can come off the water knowing we had a great race
4800616 i won a match to get the bronze and youre losing a match to get the silver
4800617 democracy is not just about voting it is also about protection of minorities
4800618 the old pier is still over in the south shore where the trolley used to come out from syracuse and turn around and the ferry used to come in and pick up the people and bring them out here
4800619 i think we found the foundation of old hotel where that was
4800620 it had seen several different phases over the years of usage it had been heavily vandalized in the late 80s early 90s and it was decided that for safety reasons that the island would be closed to the public
4800621 after awhile they took and they destroyed the prism up on top of the lighthouse and they threw the batteries off and they kind of destroyed it so they locked it up and kept people out
4800622 we did some cleanup work took care of some hazardous trees that were on the island cleaned up some trails and this spring got it open to the public
4800623 at this point its a small piece of tranquility on the western edge of oneida lake
4800624 if they do something every year maybe well get some picnic tables out here and fireplaces and portable toilets and get it so everyone can use it
4800625 at this time we have no other plans for it

4800702 for many people chinas performance here is something of an eye opener
4800703 coming into the games we felt china should be viewed as the favorite not only because its competing at home but also because of the significant investment being made in developing what will ultimately be one of the most sophisticated sports systems ever built
4800704 having her coach for america is an honor for china
4800705 its a different era from the cold war its globalization people are more open and chinese mindsets have changed too
4800706 the war for gold medals is raging at the beijing olympics and the americans are losing
4800707 this olympic games has seen the most world records broken and has the highest television audience turning it into a leader of happy good times
4800708 i think well be leaving here very much with a smile on our faces
4800709 were going to run out of adjectives here soon to describe what michaels doing
4800710 a very special moment in sports history is being written before our eyes
4800711 oh no then he will tell his mummee and daddee i am stuck in the toilet
4800712 with climate change and the opening of the northwest passage were seeing increases in all those areas
4800713 our scenarios are focused on the types of marine disasters that could potentially happen with a sharp increase in naval activity in the north
4800714 when we starting planning for the exercise it was the other government departments that came to us and said these are the types scenarios wed like to be able to exercise

4800718 making love to customers is not a campaign but a lifestyle
4800719 making love to your customers is not something that you can do for a certain amount of time it is a company commitment you cant run this like an ad campaign customers will sense when it is over and leave you over exceeding expectations means treating your customers better than any other company relationship your customer has ever had

4800722 the good thing that i can really say about our offense and im speaking for myself is that you had guys that came in late myself
4800723 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4800724 we dont want to have any doubts about the decision and the integrity of fina
4800725 they say this is how it happened and we assume everybody was treated equally in the race
4800726 were satisfied with the silver medal it would have been nice to win gold but we only wanted silver for this race
4800727 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4800728 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4800729 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4800730 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4800731 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4800732 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4800733 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers

4800741 it has come to our attention that representatives of hamed ehadadi an iranian basketball player may be contacting nba teams to discuss the possibility of signing mr ehadadi to an nba player contract
4800742 we have been advised that a federal statue prohibits a person or organization in the from engaging in business dealings with iranian nationals
4800743 i am sure he will play there this season because he has played great at the olympics he is a talented player he is ok for beginning in the nba after practicing a few years you will see that he will be one of the great players
4800744 the iranian basketball federation supports him to play in the best situation for his basketball career
4800745 we would like for him to go to a place where he will play not sit on the bench thats very important for our basketball and also for him
4800746 i just couldnt live on one healthy foot anymore let alone try to skate
4800747 weve tried everything to avoid surgery because we knew it would mean missing a chunk of the season but nothing worked
4800748 i am pretty upset it probably wont set in till i get back to the athletes village
4800749 i may be in need of more races but that is no excuse perhaps i could have done more training and performed in more races
4800750 i just tried to keep my rhythm my hamstring feels good it is just one of those things
4800751 at the same time i gave my best and everyone knows i did i just ran out of time
4800752 i pushed all the way to the finishing line but my mechanics werent what i wanted them to be i couldnt get them where i wanted them to be
4800753 i was feeling more confident in every round but it just didnt come together
4800754 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
4800755 i dont have good finishes at those race tracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
4800756 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
4800757 it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4800758 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
4800759 it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
4800760 the first thing i need to know is how much fuel do we need to save
4800761 you cant tell the driver to save fuel with five laps to go in the race the information has to be fed to a driver as soon as that run starts
4800762 look were on the edge here the only way to save fuel is to go slower you de accelerate sooner youre off the throttle sooner youre on the throttle later and youre on the throttle less aggressively
4800763 by the way you still have to make reasonable lap times in most cases
4800764 were just trying to get better and we did definitely improve on road courses
4800765 but these bigger tracks we still are it seems like always about two or three laps less than what everyone else is im not a fan of the fuel mileage races i like the fastest car winning i dont think the fans like a crew chief race i think they like to see a drivers race
4800766 it depends on what side of the fence you are on man
4800767 if you are on the winning side you are happy dont matter how
4800768 i feel a little bit bitter but i did my best and i dont have any excuse because i tried hard
4800769 as soon as i saw i had covered the field and i knew i would win i was very happy and i started to celebrate
4800770 i wanted to put the pressure on from the start and i could do that with the first round throw i was really happy to get a personal best
4800771 it was an amazing feeling it was a very long exciting and nerve racking competition because you can never put your guard down with the belarussians up against you
4800772 i went to hug my sister and niece i was so happy to share the experience with them
4800773 i just arrived in beijing the day before yesterday and was not accustomed to the beijing climate and time
4800774 frankly we expected a good performance from valerie and in fact my coach predicted she would throw 20 50 unfortunately my physical condition didnt allow me to compete with her but she really deserves this win
4800775 i cant begin to imagine the me i would be without you

4800784 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4800785 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4800786 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4800787 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4800790 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4800791 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4800792 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4800793 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4800794 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4800795 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4800796 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4800797 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4800798 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4800799 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4800800 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4800801 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4800802 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4800803 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4800804 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4800805 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4800806 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4800807 summarized as i went there and i saw this or we tried this and we think it is good

4800809 the final will be tough but i will do my best
4800810 the russians are good and i have a lot of respect for maria mutola also and i congratulate her for reaching the final
4800811 im now ready for the challenge i will sit down with pamela jelimo and see how to approach the final we normally sit down and discuss our races but before that i will just relax try and have some fun and not think too much about the final
4800812 i tried to use as little energy as possible but i had to move in front because i was afraid of being locked out by the pack
4800813 i will share some strategies with janeth before the final which will of course be very tough but we are prepared for it
4800814 my coach had said it would be good for me if i lost when he said that i was fired up
4800815 i said im going to go for it and when i saw that finish i said wow
4800816 im quite happy with my performance if anybody ever told me that i would finish fifth in the final of the olympics i would have taken it as a big joke
4800817 i still have some time on my side and no one should write me off by the time the london olympics come round i will have hit my peak
4800818 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4800819 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4800820 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4800821 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4800822 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4800823 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4800824 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4800825 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4800826 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4800827 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4800828 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4800829 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4800830 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4800831 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4800832 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4800833 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4800834 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4800835 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4800836 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4800837 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4800838 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4800839 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4800840 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4800841 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4800842 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4800843 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4800844 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4800845 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4800846 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4800847 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4800848 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4800849 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4800850 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4800851 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4800852 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4800853 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4800854 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4800855 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4800856 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4800857 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4800858 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4800859 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4800860 who are open to doing something on the production side
4800861 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4800862 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4800863 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4800864 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4800865 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4800866 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4800867 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4800868 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4800869 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4800870 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4800871 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4800872 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4800873 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4800874 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4800875 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4800876 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4800877 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4800878 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel

4800901 during one whirlwind weekend early in 2004 greg swann helped me and my husband find just the right valley home because we had never lived in the desert we werent sure what we wanted or needed in an arizona house but later commented that it was the perfect place for us our avondale home was cozy and comfortable yet offered lots of room for company was located in a great neighborhood admired for its gorgeous landscaping especially the backyard and provided easy access to work shopping hiking trails and church because of gregs expertise research and tenacity by sunday afternoon we narrowed our choices to a house that had only been listed a few days he not only gave us his undivided attention and energy for the weekend he also educated us on the idiosyncrasies of the desert and points of interest around the valley two and a half years later when my husband was informed of yet another job transfer one of our first thoughts was we need to call bloodhound realty we knew selling our home would be more difficult than buying it because the real estate climate had morphed from a sellers market to a buyers market and we knew bloodhound would work hard to create interest in our property that they did despite the fact that 48 000 other homes glutted the multi list we received an offer within two weeks but thats not the end of the story after the movers packed our belongings and we checked into a motel in our new city expecting to stay two days until both houses closed the glitches began too numerous to mention we wont go into the gory glitch details however i will say that cathleens calm demeanor as well as her determination to stay in constant contact with all the entities involved and to work through the problems got us through a tough time cathleen and greg are friendly and capable intelligent and efficient they are quick to answer phone calls and e mails no matter how mundane or ignorant the questions or comments best of all they are both genuinely great people bloodhound realty is the best

4801007 we have very good evidence of links between osama bin laden al qaeda operatives and what happened on september 11
4801008 proof had to be delivered that the september 11 terror attack came from abroad
4801009 i have seen absolutely powerful and incontrovertible evidence of his osama bin ladens link to the events of the 11th of september
4801010 there is no evidence presented in the dossier that directly links bin laden to september 11
4801011 there was no doubt of bin ladens responsibility for the september 11 attacks before the tape was discovered
4801012 the american translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it
4801013 the reason why 9 11 is not mentioned on osama bin ladens most wanted page is because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
4801014 bin laden has not been formally charged in connection with 9 11
4801015 the fbi gathers evidence once evidence is gathered it is turned over to the department of justice the department of justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury in the case of the 1998 united states embassies being bombed bin laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury he has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9 11 because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
4801016 we havent heard much from him i e bin laden and i wouldnt necessarily say hes at the center of any command structure and again i dont know where he is i ill repeat what i said i truly am not that concerned about him

4801025 i was not involved in the september 11 attacks in the united states nor did i have knowledge of the attacks there exists a government within a government within the united states the united states should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between islam and christianity that secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks the american system is totally in the control of the jews whose first priority is israel not the united states i have already said that we are not hostile to the united states we are against the system which makes other nations slaves of the united states or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom

4801093 those gleams of light in space gave us life light bring us joy our flowers blossom under the grace of light without it we would have never come to existence we have become the guardian of this light i want to be the spark which gives light to raise the fountain of life i wish to cause righteousness to prevail to destroy the wicked and evil to prevent the strong from hurting the weak to go forth like the sun over the blackheaded minded people to enlighten the land and to further the welfare of the people their collective will for peace coupled with the unsullied forces of love will destroy your somber heart today is your judgment day father
4801094 as the holy one then i acknowledged when at life birth i beheld you i was rewarded by love and good deeds evil to evil a good destiny for the good
4801095 weve got to get wins from here on out it doesnt matter if its against a friend or someone else
4801096 i just wish the outcome was a little bit better but i was happy with the outing
4801097 im not picking on anybody im not mad at anybody but verlanders had a tough year
4801098 you dont count on something like that from a guy like that
4801099 hes locked in and when theres a man on base it seems like he turns it up a notch
4801100 you just prepare yourself the only thing you do different is vary your work in between starts ive never had a problem with pitch counts
4801101 we feel terrible for izzy we have to move on but hes an important part of what weve done
4801102 there are some signs there of what he does and does well
4801103 im seeing the ball well and im focusing on that
4801104 it sounds kind of cliche but its true when you can keep it that simple you kind of allow yourself to play kind of get out of your own way
4801105 tonight everyone was just dead we just didnt do our jobs
4801106 hes got electric stuff throwing 97 and 98 mph its hard to hit 97 even if you know its coming he had everything working today
4801107 thats the good thing about being a reliever youre going to get another chance
4801108 it feels good to go out there and nail down the victory
4801109 pedro did everything we could ask of him given the stage of his career hes in
4801110 for me its all about executing a game plan and making sure i have a good command of my pitches
4801111 with the mets theyre the type of team that can get on you and before you know it things can snowball
4801112 more standardization more central counterpart activity cleaner resolution in the case of a problem and better transparency
4801113 im close its just that the abdominals are tough youve got to be careful with them
4801114 everything i threw was right over the middle of the plate thats definitely not the way i wanted to come back
4801115 we have a pitcher here he has four pitches and he can throw them for strikes
4801116 brad has been in one of the most consistent zones that hes been in in a long time
4801117 hes got a history of being somewhat streaky but this has been consistent day to day to day
4801118 if we get down and we dont come back were not champions and were not men
4801119 i just happen to get one i could handle and get it over the fence
4801120 our offense has been shut down and im still trying to figure out why
4801121 but i think before the season is done well go on a hot streak
4801122 we want him in there because hes one of the leagues elite offensive players but lets make sure hes all right for the long haul
4801123 it feels good you cant lie having a night like that in front of family and friends
4801124 coming home is great but thats icing on the cake right there
4801125 when youre playing in front of 50 family members and everybody is expecting something its kind of like a playoff atmosphere almost
4801126 tomorrows going to come pretty quick so you have to bounce back
4801127 we have another tough one tomorrow and one on sunday as well then weve got a pretty tough road trip so weve got to turn the page pretty quickly and find that fire again
4801128 i like the way these kids get after it for nine innings
4801129 im happy for the team this has been a difficult place for us
4801130 i felt this was my best start since ive been back
4801131 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
4801132 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
4801133 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
4801134 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
4801135 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
4801136 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
4801137 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
4801138 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
4801139 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
4801140 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
4801141 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
4801142 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
4801143 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
4801144 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
4801145 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
4801146 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
4801147 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
4801148 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
4801149 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
4801150 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
4801151 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
4801152 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
4801153 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
4801154 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
4801155 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
4801156 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
4801157 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
4801158 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
4801159 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
4801160 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
4801161 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
4801162 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

4801173 in no way reflects the policy or opinion of the united states military
4801174 recognizes cgsc faculty for published writing contributions that enhance the mission of the college
4801175 the us army command and general staff college educates and develops leaders for full spectrum joint interagency and multinational operations acts as lead agent for the armys leader development program and advances the art and science of the profession of arms in support of army operational requirements
4801176 belief in god is a foundational factor once you do away with god as a given truth all other things are immediately affected by that for instance once god does not exist you suddenly have no reference to greatness outside of yourself and no revelation outside of yourself the greatest thing in life suddenly becomes something or someone else like yourself perhaps
4801177 strikes deep into the power of sin and renders it ineffective
4801178 only my goodnatured ness can help me contribute to the betterment of my unit or team when i realize that sin is an agent i can more quickly identify my own tendency to corrupt a group and bring havoc to what needs cohesion and team confidence my sin can also make my agenda more important than my units agenda and thus lead to unit failure
4801179 ive seen individuals from all economic levels and situations fail to get situated philosophically and religiously ending up wandering in institutions like our military just when you need that inner source of clarity and direction it fails to surface and when you could have made a difference for your team you fail
4801180 i was told because i cant put my personal beliefs aside and pray with troops i wouldnt make a good leader
4801181 look there is simply no other way to say it but to speak the absolute brutal truth here general petraeus has shockingly abrogated and noxiously defiled the sacred oath he took to protect and preserve support and defend not a parochial biblical worldview of the new testaments gospel of jesus christ but the united states constitution which includes a specific beacon provision which boldly proclaims absolutely no religious test in clause 3 article 6 by so very prominently and universally endorsing chaplain mccoys book with its unadulterated promotion of christian religious supremacy and concomitant excoriating and denigrating of the veracity integrity and character of the hundreds of thousands of united states military personnel who freely elect to follow no religious path petraeus unlawfully fashions his own de facto religion test in direct contravention of americas most cherished and beloved governing document his command leadership role thus has become terminally freighted and compromised with this disgusting vile unconstitutional christian religious tyranny and exceptionalism at precisely the same time we are at war with islamic fundamentalists framing americas iraq and afghanistan combat efforts as a modern day crusade the monumentally detrimental national security risks attendant to petraeuss actions of constitutional defiance justify the swift forfeiture of his titular position of military command and further cry out for his immediate punishment by general courts martial under article 134
4801182 under the rubric of free speech and the twisted idea of the separation of church and state there has evolved more and more an anti christian bias in this country
4801183 being christian should bring goodness to our culture but the way it is being censored in our society you would think that to be a christian is to be a wicked torturous warmonger who wields religion over the heads and hearts of local governments to establish more wicked rules of right and wrong for everyone to obey without question where is this wickedness since when did christian become evil
4801184 i will not proselytize from other religious bodies but i retain the right to evangelize those who are not affiliated

4801200 i am relaxed you just have to focus on the dives
4801201 apa alasan memilih teknik perminyakan ketika mau mendaftar di perguruan tinggi
4801202 ketika mengisi formulir pendaftaran saya tidak ragu membuat pilihan pertama dengan cepat saya mengisi formulir dan memilih teknik elektro pilihan yang sudah ada sejak sma saya senang belajar matematika dan fisika dan selalu dapat nilai bagus pada dua mata pelajaran ini jadi saya tidak begitu banyak berpikir membuat pilihan pertama tapi ketika mau membuat pilihan kedua saya agak lama berpikir tidak punya alternatif
4801203 waktu itu di desa informasi semacam itu tidak ada minim lah informasi tentang self assessment jadi agak lama saya mempertimbangkan pilihan kedua sementara keinginan kuliah di bandung sangat besar bahkan sudah terpikir yang penting kuliah di bandung
4801204 waktu itu ada juga berita kalau rating pilihan pertama dan kedua berdekatan maka kalau tidak lulus testing pada pilihan pertama kemungkinan besar gagal pada pilihan kedua jadi saya ingin menghindar dari hal ini
4801205 ketika hasil ujian masuk perguruan tinggi negeri diumumkan di koran saya diterima di jurusan teknik perminyakan sejak itu saya mengembara di padang pasir selama 14 tahun
4801206 pilihan pilihan sejenis ini memang paling menarik buat manusia banyak keputusan kita dimotivasi oleh uang judika malau
4801207 saya dapat banyak pelajaran dari kehidupan orang lain biografi otobiografi dan kisah nyata yang dilihat sendiri
4801208 biografi tentang john calvin martin luther penginjil hudson taylor billy graham abraham lincoln john f kennedy soekarno t b simatupang dan biografi lain pernah saya baca banyak inspirasi dan pelajaran yang dipetik dari kehidupan mereka
4801209 pengalaman orang bisa jadi contoh bagi kita maupun bagi orang yang hidup di masa mendatang
4801210 sejarah adalah guru yang baik kalau kita menghargai sejarah kita dapat belajar banyak bisa jadi bekal untuk menjalani hidup jadi bagaimana kisah hidupmu
4801211 baiklah saya cerita dulu secara singkat latar belakang keluarga saya lahir di medan pada tahun 1963 tapi dibesarkan di desa kurang lebih 19 tahun kehidupan di desa tidak jauh dengan kehidupan bertani semenjak sd sampai sma saya banyak bergulat dengan kehidupan bertani mencangkul menanam benih menanam padi merumput menyemprot hama padi dan memanen di rumah pun masih harus memasak mencuci piring menyapu rumah mencuci dan menyeterika pakaian
4801212 didikan keluarga relatif keras terutama dari ibu ia tidak sabar melihat kami malas kalau bangun pagi terlambat ibu langsung memanggil manggil dengan suara agak keras bahkan mencubit kaki kalau belum juga bangun begitu kerasnya suaranya sampai terdengar oleh tetangga
4801213 ibu tipe pekerja keras tetapi hasil kerja di sawah tidak baik hasil kerjanya harus diulangi merumput misalnya ayah harus mengerjakan ulang apa yang dikerjakan ibu
4801214 ibu mempunyai naluri bisnis yang baik hampir semua pembelian tanah atau sawah ia prakarsai bahkan penjualan sawah agar bisa membeli sawah lain pernah ia lakukan tanpa konsultasi dengan ayah
4801215 professi ibu adalah bidan ia punya balai pengobatan umum tulisannya tidak terbaca tapi ia ingat siapa yang punya hutang dan berapa
4801216 berbeda dengan ibu ayah tipe pekerja ulet dan rajin bahkan sering lupa untuk istirahat kalau kerja hasil kerjanya rapi apa saja yang dikerjakan selalu apik mulai dari merumput membuat kandang ayam membuat meja memasak menggiling cabe mencuci pakaian menyeterika pakaian tulisannya juga rapi ia punya administrasi dokumen yang baik oleh karena kerajinan dan kerapiannya ia sering dipercaya jadi sekretaris di gereja kumpulan sosial bahkan di instansi kesehatan tingkat kabupaten penampilannya rapi bahkan oleh para bidan dikira pejabat karena sering berpakaian jas mini anak anaknya tidak bisa meniru cara kerja ayah
4801217 ayah dan ibu rajin dan aktif dalam kehidupan gereja semasih di bangku sd bahkan sampai sma hampir tiap malam kami menyanyikan pujian membaca alkitab dan berdoa ketika orang tua berdoa saya dan adik sering mengantuk bahkan sering berdoa dengan satu mata terbuka dan satu tertutup
4801218 oleh karena pengabdian belasan tahun di gereja dua kali ayah mendapat penghargaan berupa salib emas satu dari gereja tingkat resort satu lagi dari gereja di desa setelah menjadi majelis gereja selama kurang lebih 30 tahun
4801219 adik hanya satu orang sempat ada adik perempuan tetapi tuhan mengambilnya ketika ia berumur 3 tahun itulah sekilas latar belakang keluarga
4801220 kehidupan sulit di desa memaksa mereka untuk berpikir dan berjuang keras untuk memperbaiki hidupnya ada yang berhasil dan menemukan hidup yang benar dan banyak juga yang berhasil tapi
4801221 substansi business excellence sebenarnya bukan hal yang baru ada yang menyebutnya dengan istilah kaizen business process improvement re engineering atau ubstansinya sama namun agar punya bayangan tentang business excellence ada baiknya kita beri definisi
4801222 untuk percakapan kita business excellence adalah adanya integrasi dari seluruh unsur unsur dalam sebuah organisasi
4801223 ada integrasi antara visi dan missi nilai nilai kepemimpinan sumber daya manusia kebijakan business process kepuasan kerja kepuasan pelanggan dan dampaknya terhadap masyarakat pimpinan perusahaan tidak hanya mementingkan hasil tapi juga bagaimana hasil itu dicapai tidak hanya mementingkan struktur organisasi tapi juga memberdayakan seluruh orang orang dalam organisasi untuk mencapai sasaran organisasi tidak hanya memikirkan biaya yang minim tapi juga memberikan ruang kepada karyawan untuk berkreasi mengelola sumber sumber yang ada untuk hal yang lebih baik termasuk keuntungan bagi semua pihak tanpa mengabaikan nilai nilai etis jadi secara menyuluruh ada sistematika bagaimana kita mengelola organisasi dengan kata lain tidak ada unsur unsur dalam organisasi diabaikan semuanya diberdayakan secara optimal untuk mencapai tujuan yang telah ditetapkan dan hasil yang lebih baik untuk kebaikan semua pihak atau stakeholder itulah business excellence yang kita maksud dalam percakapan kita
4801224 jadi business excllece mencakup semua hal yang menjadi bagian dari organisasi
4801225 di republik ini hal ini masih hanya sekedar wacana bahkan pemikiran untuk ke sana pun masih jarang terdengar di berbagai organisasi mengapa ada pemborosan biaya biaya yang terbuang percuma biaya biaya siluman atau kebocoran keuangan di sana sini itu karena pemahaman tentang business excellence masih minim
4801226 memang cukup menyedihkan jikalau kita tidak berusaha memahami makna business excellence tidak peduli terhadap organisasi dan tidak peduli dengan aktifitas yang terjadi dalam organisasi yang kita pikirkan hanya keuntungan sendiri tidak ada usaha usaha untuk menjabarkan keadilan atau berusaha meniti jalan kesana
4801227 jadi implementasi business excellence masih ibarat langit dan bumi begitu
4801228 pemahaman ini perlu tanpa pemahaman sulit kita menjabarkan konsepnya kita perlu memahami unsur unsur dalam business excellence dan relasi antar unsur yang satu dan unsur yang lain dengan pemahaman demikian ada kemungkinan kita dapat menjabarkan konsep itu
4801229 kalau orang tua sudah mati berapa banyakpun harta yang dimiliki anak orangtua tidak dapat merasakannya membantu orang tua hanya berarti ketika orang tua masih hidup
4801230 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4801231 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4801232 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4801237 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4801238 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4801239 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4801240 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4801241 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4801242 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4801243 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4801244 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4801245 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
4801246 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
4801247 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4801248 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4801249 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4801250 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4801251 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4801252 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4801253 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4801254 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4801255 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4801256 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4801257 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4801258 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4801259 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4801260 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4801261 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4801262 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4801263 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4801264 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4801265 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4801266 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
4801267 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
4801268 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4801269 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4801270 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4801271 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4801272 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4801273 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4801274 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4801275 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4801276 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4801277 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4801278 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4801279 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4801280 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4801281 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4801282 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4801283 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4801284 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4801285 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4801286 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4801287 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4801288 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4801289 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4801290 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4801291 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4801292 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4801293 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4801294 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4801295 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente

4801302 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4801303 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4801304 aktifitas di desa bisa dibilang monoton hampir tiap hari kecuali hari minggu saya harus ke sawah mencangkul membibit menanam padi merumput sawah menyemprot tanaman memanen sampai menjemur padi selain itu saya masih harus memasak mencuci piring mencuci pakaian menyapu rumah menyiram halaman di desa tidak ada istilah pembantu seperti di kota di kota anak muda dan remaja hampir tidak punya tugas seperti yang saya lakukan mereka punya banyak waktu untuk belajar ikut bimbingan belajar les musik olah raga liburan atau refreshing ke pantai atau ke tempat tempat hiburan kontras dengan kehidupan remaja di desa
4801305 pikiran untuk keluar dari desa sudah ada sejak di smp
4801306 ketika di smp sudah ada pikiran untuk keluar dari desa begitu
4801307 ya apalagi setelah kerabat yang merantau ke jakarta berceritera tentang kehidupan di jakarta terutama ceritera tentang itb ini sangat memotivasi saya saya semakin semangat dan rajin belajar kuliah di itb itu cita cita yang terselip dalam pikiran
4801308 saya berangkat ke bandung dengan menumpang kapal laut tampomas setiba di jakarta besoknya diantar saudara ke stasiun bis cilitan dan dari sana saya berangkat sendirian ke bandung
4801309 setelah diuji baru tahu apakah lulus atau tidak memang harus begitu lewat ujian kita baru tahu apakah kita sudah tahu atau belum
4801310 karena tidak punya harapan lulus saya kembali ke jakarta untuk seterusnya kembali ke medan agar nama saya di usu tidak dicoret karena terlambat mendaftar
4801311 beberapa hari sebelum berangkat ke medan masih sempat jalan jalan ke ancol dan berfoto di sana mungkin ini terakhir bagi saya datang ke jawa pikirku
4801312 nama nama yang lulus masuk perguruan tinggi diumumkan di koran saya membeli koran suara karya di bawah jembatan layang cawang saya membacanya tapi tidak begitu antusias karena merasa bakal tidak lulus hati tidak dag dig dug saya baca judul juruan elektro pilihan pertama nama saya tidak ada kemudian saya baca judul teknik perminyakan pilihan kedua nama saya ada saya tidak percaya saya menutup mata dan saya baca lagi nama saya tetap ada karena tidak percaya saya suruh saudara yang waktu itu bersama saya untuk baca apakah nama saya ada tanya saya ya jawabnya saya langsung meloncat loncat kegirangan di bawah jembatan cawang saya senang luar biasa bukan karena diterima di itb tapi karena saya berpikir bahwa saya tidak akan hidup di desa dan tidak ke sawah lagi
4801313 itulah salah satu peristiwa yang paling menggembirakan dalam hidup saya dan sejak itu saya meninggalkan desa kecuali ketika pulang kampung mengunjungi orang tua
4801314 ya keinginan untuk sekolah di smun 1 medan sebenarnya datang dari abang ayah amang tua dalam bahasa batak ide ini ia berikan di depan banyak undangan keluarga pada acara lepas sidi di rumah amang tua bilang sma harus di medan saya senang termotivasi untuk belajar dan kata kata itu selalu saya ingat
4801315 amang tua memang relatif berhasil hidupnya ia orang kantoran dan bekerja di kadin sumatera utara ia juga sudah punya rumah agak besar di medan jl mongonsidi i no 22
4801316 setelah lulus smp ayah dan saya berangkat ke medan untuk mendaftar di smun 1 kami naik sepeda motor saya mengisi formulir ujian masuk setelah mendaftar dan mendapat normor ujian saya sempatkan melihat laboratorium smun 1 medan saya akan sekolah di sini
4801317 setelah urusan pendaftaran selesai kami berangkat ke rumah amang tua tapi tidak bertemu dengan amang tua karena ia dinas ke luar kota kami hanya bertemu dengan isterinya inang tua ayah pun bicara tentang rencana ingin sekolah di smun 1 medan
4801318 sore itu itu juga saya mendaftar ke smun lubuk pakam dengan nomor urut no 537 dan setelah testing masuk smun lubuk pakam saya diterima dan masuk kelas i 1 mimpi sekolah di smun 1 medan hanya tinggal mimpi gara gara isu uang suap rp 50 000
4801319 uang suap sering membuat orang orang yang punya potensi tidak mendapat kesempatan untuk mengecap pendidikan yang bagus namun pendidikan tidak hanya semata mata soal mutu sekolah kerajinan keuletan dan belajar tekun juga sangat berperan ada orang yang lulus dari smu kota kecil tapi bisa belajar sampai ke luar negeri karena dapat beasiswa
4801320 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
4801321 ada beberapa hal yang dapat dipelajari dari semut jawab radot pertama semut tidak malas semut rajin tidak ada di antara semut yang jalannya pelan seperti bebek kedua semut punya budaya sopan bila bertemu sesama semut mereka bersalam salaman mungkin mereka mengatakan apa kabar dalam setiap perjumpaan mereka ketiga mereka mau bekerja sama semut melakukan tugas secara gotong royong untuk membawa makanan ke sarang mereka alam memang banyak memberi contoh kepada kita bagaimana hidup
4801322 semut atau binatang tidak dapat berpikir seperti manusia semut juga tidak dapat memahami manusia seperti kita memahami semut semut tidak punya akal perasaan atau kehendak semut tidak dapat memikrikann apakah jalan ini salah atu tidak semut juga tidak dapat merasakann penderitaan orang lain semut tidak mempunyai ambisi untuk menjadi yang terpandang
4801323 kalau semut tidak dapat mengerti manusia apakah manusia dapat mengerti tuhan
4801324 ada tiga kategori keberadaan allah manusia dan alam semesta dan keberadaan yang lebih rendah tidak dapat mengerti keberadaan yang lebih tinggi tetapi keberadaan yang lebih tinggi dapat mengerti keberadaan yang lebih rendah jadi manusia tidak dapat memahami tuhan
4801325 maksudmu tuhan dapat mengenal manusia tetapi manusia tidak dapat mengenal tuhan secara komprehensif begitu
4801326 ya satu satunya aternatif agar keberadaan yang lebih rendah dapat memahami keberadaan yang lebih tinggi adalah kalau keberadaan yang lebih tinggi menjadi keberadaan yang lebih rendah misalnya manusia harus menjadi semut agar semut dapat memahami bahasa manusia tapi itu adalah hal yang tidak mungkin kita tidak punya kuasa untuk merubah diri kita menjadi ciptaan lain menjadi semut misalnya demikian juga antara tuhan dan manusia tuhan harus menjelma menjadi manusia agar manusia dapat mengenal nya
4801327 kalau demikian apakah ada kemungkinan tuhan menjelma jadi manusia agar kita dapat mengenal nya apakah hal itu mungkin
4801328 maksudmu tuhan memperkenalkan diri nya lewat alam semesta bagaimana kita bisa tahu
4801329 langit menceritakan kemuliaan allah alam semesta menyatakan kemuliaannya bukan hanya itu saja alam semesta ini ditopang oleh allah dan ada hukum hukum yang mengaturnya ada hukum yang mengatur alam semesta ada hukum sehingga bulan bintang dan planet beredar pada orbitnya ini sudah diatur oleh tuhan sedemikian rupa dan ditopang oleh tuhan dengan kekuatannya yang tidak dapat kita lihat
4801330 kedua tuhan menyatakan diri nya lewat hati nurani kita hati nurani dalam diri kita adalah wakil tuhan hati nurani berbicara bila kita tergoda untuk membunuh berzinah mencuri berbohong atau menginginkan milik orang lain hati nurani akan meniupkan pluit kalau kita berbuat jahat
4801331 tentu saja hati nurani bisa juga padam bila tidak dilatih dan dipelihara namun demikian alam dan hati nurani ini tidak dapat menjadi acuan mutlak untuk menjalani hidup ini keduanya tidak dapat menjadi referensi yang akurat bagi kita karena kita sendiri tidak dapat lagi melihat segala sesuatu dengan baik dan benar
4801332 hati nurani kita tidak selalu dapat mengatakan apa yang baik dan benar hati nurani kita sudah terkontaminasi sehingga tidak dapat dijadikan acuan untuk membedakan apa yang baik dan benar
4801333 jadi hati nurani dan alam tidak cukup untuk menuntun kita menjalani hidup ini tidak cukup untuk menjawab seluruh pertanyaan atau persoalan persoalan hidup kita
4801334 kalau di eropah atau amerika utara hal ini sudah tidak umum lagi
4801335 apalagi di eropah dengan semakin terpinggirnya agama dari kehidupan orang eropah semakin sulit kita mendengar allah dalam percakapan pengembangan pribadi di amerika serikat mungkin masih kita dengar tetapi itupun bukanlah hal yang umum di kalangan kristen mungkin masih kita dengar di timur pun karena pengaruh barat jarang juga kita mendengar allah dalam pelatihan pelatihan pengembangan pribadi allah tersisihkan dari pelatihan pelatihan tersebut
4801336 sulit mengabaikan allah dari kehidupan kita pada faktanya kita selalu berhadapan dengan dia setiap saat udara yang kita hirup langit yang masih ada pada tempatnya dan dunia masih eksis sulit kita mengabaikan tuhan dari kehidupan kita
4801337 dari sisi agama sulit untuk tidak mengakui nya semua agama mengakui keberadaan pribadi yang lebih kuat dari manusia apakah itu agama hindu budda islam kristen dan yahudi pengikut agama ini sulit mengabaikan eksistensi tuhan jadi ketika kita membicarakan pengembangan pribadi tidak mungkin kita mengabaikan eksistensi tuhan
4801338 jujur saja tidak ada pengembangan pribadi tanpa pertolongan tuhan seluruh eksistensi manusia tergantung kepadanya jikalau seseorang dianggap mengalami pertumbuhan itu semata mata karena tuhan juga jadi tuhan tidak dapat diabaikan dari pelatihan pelatihan pengembangan pribadi
4801339 kalau kita mengakui tuhan kita tidak dapat mengabaikan tuhan dari topik pengembangan pribadi
4801340 sikap kita kepada tuhan berikaitan dengan allah seperti apa yang kita yakini apakah allah adalah allah yang absolut apakah allah eksis pada dirinya sendiri apakah allah hidup selama lamanya apakah allah dibatasi oleh waktu dan ruang apakah allah mempunyai personalitas apakah allah adalah pencipta manusia dan segala sesuatu apakah allah adalah penopang segala kehidupan apakah allah mempunyai kuasa atas hidup manusia apakah allah mempunyai petunjuk yang harus diikuti ciptaannya
4801341 bila kita mengakui bahwa allah adalah absolut pencipta allah adalah roh allah adalah penopang kehidupan manusia mempunyai kuasa atau hidup manusia allah eksis pada dirinya sendiri allah itu eksis selama lamanya tidak dibatasi ruang dan waktu maka mau tidak mau kita harus taat padanna kita harus menghormati allah dengan hormat setinggi tingginya kita menyembah dia dengan kata lain apa yang allah katakan atau perintahkan kita harus turuti dengan kata lain allah itu mutlak berkuasa atas kehidupan manusia tidak ada ruang untuk kita mengambil kemuliaannya
4801342 hampir semua pengikut agama khususnya agama agama islam kristen dan yahudi bersikap demikian
4801343 pelatihan pelatihan pengembangan manusia mengabaikannya jarang kita temukan allah dalam pelatihan pengembangan pribadi tidak ada keberanian untuk mengatakan bahwa pengembangan pribadi tidak dapat dipisahkan dari allah pengembangan pribadi tidak mempunyai makna apa apa bila tidak dikaitkan dengan tuhan
4801344 setiap pengembangan pribadi tidak dapat dipisahkan dari tuhan tuhan selalu memegang kontrol terhadap pengembangan pribadi apakah seseorang percaya atau tidak kepada tuhan tuhan tetap berperan dalam pengembangan pribadi seseorang tidak ada seseorang bertumbuh dan berkembang tanpa peran tuhan terlepas apakah ia yakin atau tidak terhadapnya
4801345 biasanya kalau kita sebut dengan pengembangan pribadi kita langsung membahas program tidak ada pembahasan tentang tuhan
4801346 memang kita dalam keadaan sulit yang besar di satu sisi kalau kita bicara tuhan setiap orang akan mencibir mereka tidak mau nama tuhan dibawa ke dalam diskusi hal itu masih dianggap sesuatu yang sensitif di barat barangkali hal itu masih mungkin oleh karena ada pengaruh post modern apa saja termasuk agama dapat kita bicarakan sebab bagi post modern tidak ada konsep yang mutlak jadi sah saja membicarakan apa saja
4801347 sepertinya tidak ada pilihan lain kita harus menyertakan allah dalam pengembangan pribadi
4801348 itu pilihan yang harus kita buat apakah kita mau melibatkan tuhan dalam pengembangan pribadi atau tidak

4801432 with a potential noise hot spot near windsor where the southern departures crossed over the path of the northern which produced an island of noise near windsor or possibly just to the west
4801433 the queen faces the same problem that millions of londoners face which is more problems from noise right overhead but the government might have picked on the wrong resident to place beneath an island of noise
4801434 these documents show that thousands of households may well have to have substantial noise insulation as a result of these plans given that the queen may be living in a noise hot spot her own home may qualify for double glazing and noise insulation
4801435 i am deeply concerned that this information was not revealed through the consultation process and was forced out through an foi request
4801436 support for adding capacity at heathrow is conditional on the government being satisfied that strict local environmental and noise limits set out in the 2003 white paper can be met
4801437 ministers have turned a blind eye in the obscene interests of costs these cases are not seen as a priority and most of them simply go to the bottom of the pile
4801438 the home office is turning a blind eye and allowing some of the most vulnerable people to be put in the care of people who by definition cannot have a criminal records check
4801439 there is potential for embarrassment if the immigration service is not seen to be actively addressing this issue
4801440 does not allow the immigration service to take any form of action
4801441 there is no deterrent factor for those involved in these activities
4801442 the severity of the reported incidents varies ranging from care workers not being suitably qualified to the abuse of clients within their care if this is allowed to continue without action all have the potential to be damaging to the public and media perception of the immigration service
4801443 this report exposes the governments big lie there are not enough resources to enforce immigration law because of budgetary constraints and activity is set to decrease not increase due to cuts in duties scheduled for weekends vitally important work wont be actioned and vulnerable people will be at risk
4801444 every visa applicant is now fingerprinted before they reach here id cards become compulsory for all foreign nationals from november and 10 000 on the spot fines are now in place for any illegal workers
4801445 the predominant nationalities identified working illegally within the care industry do not necessarily correspond with current national priorities for enforcement action
4801446 the big issue for me is getting the guns out of society
4801447 we continue to make clear our view that the best way to improve the situation in tibet is through meaningful dialogue between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama and his representatives without pre conditions
4801448 our chinese friends must understand the worldwide concern that there is about the question of tibet
4801449 i dont close the door to any option but i think its more prudent to reserve my responses to concrete developments in the situation i want dialogue to begin and i will graduate my response according to the response given by chinese authorities
4801450 the opening ceremony is part of the games and our position against a boycott of the games has not changed we do not believe in a boycott as a way of effecting change
4801451 we feel that political leaders are starting to change their attitudes
4801452 at that point the president of france t l visions would without a doubt decide not to cover the games

4801456 thats fine but youve got to understand that this is different this isnt real life
4801457 they can become obsessed with protecting the revenue and miss the bigger picture of creating a more productive and globally competitive tax system
4801458 some in the ato see the international tax reforms of the past six years as the devils spawn and talk about rescuing the system and saving the governments revenue flows
4801459 all three of her daughters including elisabeth mccutcheon a former volleyball olympian have also returned to the united states
4801460 you know what i do is sit on the sideline and fire up the boys
4801461 i think it was comforting just getting back in the normal rhythm of the team all teams have a culture and im certainly a part of ours so it was great to be back into the game and get going again
4801462 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states

4801464 we are dearly concerned with the use of terrorism this is a tragic loss of life his life was cut short
4801465 the current system would seem to favour the rich at the expense of paye employees and that is not fair and that is an anomaly which needs correcting i dont think such a change would mean charities getting less money quite the opposite
4801466 if paye people know they will be able to claim the relief back they will probably give the charity more or invest the rebate in another charity of their choice so in that sense everyone will win
4801467 we are already well behind the usa and probably a decade behind the uk in fostering philanthropy in this country we need to act now to remove the current restrictive climate
4801468 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true

4801484 for many people chinas performance here is something of an eye opener
4801485 coming into the games we felt china should be viewed as the favorite not only because its competing at home but also because of the significant investment being made in developing what will ultimately be one of the most sophisticated sports systems ever built
4801486 having her coach for america is an honor for china
4801487 its a different era from the cold war its globalization people are more open and chinese mindsets have changed too
4801488 the war for gold medals is raging at the beijing olympics and the americans are losing

4801502 it was an experimental airplane that we had a lot of fun building and flew occasionally

4801516 the korean police at the time were notorious for fabricating evidence that didnt exist

4801543 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4801544 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4801545 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4801546 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4801547 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4801548 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4801549 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4801550 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4801551 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4801552 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4801553 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4801554 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4801555 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4801556 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4801557 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4801558 i knew i wanted to write something that i was personally involved in something that happened to me and not someone else so i thought about what was significant in my life that i enjoy telling people about and a story started to form
4801559 i changed a million things and made a lot of it fictional but its about a playwright from buffalo like me whos excited about his first show the girlfriend is fictional but the real life star of greetings was problematic like in the play the director is very much like dennis zacek the artistic director of victory gardens theater in chicago who came out to new yorkand directed greetings like dennis the director in my play is very laid back nothing throws him with chaos going on all around him the only people causing problems for the playwright are the actors
4801560 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4801561 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4801562 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4801563 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4801564 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4801565 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4801566 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4801567 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4801568 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4801569 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4801570 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4801571 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4801572 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4801573 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4801574 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4801575 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4801576 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4801577 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4801578 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4801579 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4801580 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4801581 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4801582 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4801583 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4801584 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4801585 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4801586 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4801587 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4801588 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4801589 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4801590 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4801591 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4801592 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4801593 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4801594 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4801595 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4801596 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4801597 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4801598 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4801599 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4801600 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4801601 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4801602 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4801603 i just want to enjoy this moment because its a huge moment in my career
4801604 if iran had a nuclear weapon itd be a dangerous threat to world peace
4801605 so i told people that if youre interested in avoiding world war iii it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing a nuclear iran i take the threat of iran with a nuclear weapon very seriously
4801606 not only should we reject the use of force but also the mention of force as a possibility
4801607 i do believe there is a need for another security council resolution
4801608 in the past the need to get everybody on board including russia and china led to some compromises on the nature of the sanctions i hope this will not be the case this time
4801609 es muy dif cil en las dos condiciones parece que no va a llover pero tambi n es importante que est seca la pista en el warm up para elegir los neum ticos y mejorar un poco los tiempos

4801615 i want to say in the most forceful way i can i certainly hope so
4801616 what about the supplements and doesnt every weight trainer need at least some kind of protein powder
4801617 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4801618 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4801619 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4801620 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4801621 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4801622 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4801623 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4801624 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4801625 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4801626 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4801627 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4801628 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4801629 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4801630 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4801631 an intelligent woman with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned
4801632 he had a high position and the power to save her he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family
4801633 we all knew he was the only man friend of kim soo im he slept in the house many times the baby looks like the father
4801634 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
4801635 the korean police at the time were notorious for fabricating evidence that didnt exist
4801636 it was truly an emotional moment for me to hear him say it
4801637 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
4801638 came to her begging her to save her my mother
4801639 a very gentle kind of soul honest in his own way a very anticommunist and conservative christian
4801640 i just needed to be with someone who was in the courtroom with her
4801641 not only were these events alien to our region but they also brought into question in some quarters the integrity of sadc as an institution capable of promoting the rule of law and democratic governance

4801682 i heard that jay sorta said something about me at the wimbledon tennis match
4801683 i didnt see him say it i didnt hear no audio so i dont really know if he was dissing me if he said something about me
4801684 what people dont know about jay is jay is probably the most witty rapper that ever walked the face of the earth
4801685 hes witty hes clever his metaphors will be sitting right next to you and then hit you in the face so hard that you dont know what happened thats the type of rapper jay is i was molded by that part of him and added that to my own persona and my own marksmanship as an emcee
4801686 a legend man i respect his music but that doesnt really mean i have to respect him if hes disrespecting me the jay that was talking about me at wimbeldon under his breath or says anything about me is the jay that ill go at and thats just it jay the rap artist jay the legend jay from marcy projects that hustler turned dope artist turned probably best lyricist that ever lived i have respect for im not gonna add wood to a fire thats already burning out
4801687 i have a slew of producers and im starting to develop artists and getting more focused
4801688 this my third album and its time to focus on my folks and my label the camps on the album so were just learning each other growing as a family and were gonna do big things in 2009 and the years to come

4801692 you said it again you really dont know the right word do you
4801693 thats okay if you say it fast enough people probably dont even know youre saying it wrong
4801694 remember were selling a 2 cd version of this story to raise money for the uk childrens charity barnardos
4801695 unfortunately i was obstructed by two two slower cars at the beginning of the qualifying this cost me six seven tenths but i m looking forward to tomorrow we ve got a very good car for the race from position four we can again make it onto the podium
4801696 i watched the qualifying from the grandstands it was too bad that a couple of slower cars drove in front of alex s pr mat nose when you leave the pits you ve simply got to look into your rear view mirror still we re satisfied we re on second row and are going to attack we wanted to be closer to our team mates here or perhaps even a little in front of them and we managed that
4801697 in qualifying i lost seven tenths of a second in the last turn behind a porsche that cost us third place on the grid but the bigger problem is the fact that for two days the front wheels of our car have been locking while braking we ve definitely got to solve this problem before the race
4801698 after our fond memories of le mans the qualifying result is of course a bit disappointing we ve got difficulties coming up with good balance here the car doesn t absorb the bumps well enough we ve still got a lot of work to do
4801699 that the two peugeots are in front comes as no surprise and neither does the gap but that the aston martin lola is in front of us as well is a bit of a blemish but our two cars got stuck in traffic on fresh tyres when they finally had a free lap the tyres were already less than perfect in a 1000 kilometre race grid positions four and five are really not that bad though we re going to correct that tomorrow

4801705 she was extremely encouraging she was adamant that i stay she assured me shes going to be good
4801706 its been asked for alexi to be dismissed for a while it was time
4801707 im disappointed that ruud needed to leave i dont think he had enough time to do what hes capable of doing im disappointed he didnt have a chance to stick it out
4801708 i think that ruud didnt understand what he was getting into when he came over here
4801709 its a completely different ball of wax and i think he did a poor job
4801710 galaxy have made themselves the yankees we all check the paper to see what theyre doing it sucks for the galaxy fans but for everyone else it creates a sense of solidarity
4801711 look at the kings and look at the galaxy they can fill the seats and thats all that matters to him if a new owner came in wed be happy
4801712 two people lost their jobs because of our athletic shortcomings because our owners saw a lack of effort ive been here 10 years now and every time weve lost a coach thats been their reason why if aeg had the power to they would have come in here and got rid of 22 players
4801713 the unfortunate part is that in alexi weve lost one of our own he is a guy without whom this club would not be where its at i say that with 100 confidence because ive been here when this club had zero trophies in the trophy case he taught a lot of spoiled kids how to win i speak for the group when i say he was a good person
4801714 because thats what its all about its about enjoying playing soccer its not been enjoyable for the last couple weeks hopefully with this triumph today we move forward now
4801715 as a coach youre always going to take the fall when things go wrong
4801716 coaches understand that its just the way things go its not always fair a lot of time you get more credit than you deserve and a lot of times you take more heat than you deserve thats just part of it
4801717 we had a great pre season but this is a different level
4801718 it was a difficult game and it looked like the team that scored first would get the three points and that is what happened
4801719 we did not defend well from set pieces and that cost us the game
4801720 we have signed some new players and they are clever players and they now know what to expect and they have to believe in their abilities

4801725 if i had to leave tonight would you go with me
4801726 wow everything about the way that person looks is amazing
4801727 i stayed in another class today and they took very good care of me
4801728 so whenever she doesnt want to do something your just not going to do it
4801729 it doesnt sound to me that your being there made any difference
4801730 we explained everything to her i think she was just mad that she didnt get her way
4801731 no i dont think she was mad that she didnt get her way i think she was very frightened i think she is four years old and she didnt understand
4801732 this is not true gary groman uses the tradition of men who want to have sex with men to try and outdebate him
4801733 we do not appreciate being called gary grominites said one man who is out of the closed on his
4801734 your right gay people seriously im very very sorry for being mean to gay people throughout the world and calling them gary gromans
4801735 ooh hoh hoh who ho hoo i think it is is it really really you
4801736 are you on your way to work and unhappy about where youre going
4801737 i think youre the star of this great poem written by
4801738 get drunk in a bar in a desert cry out your woes and next thing you know everyone knows your business god
4801739 its not your fault so what could you want from me ive never had a fan what do you like want a photo or autograph or something
4801740 you have like a special request or something i really have to stick to my specs
4801741 look i just thought you might like some company because you got a long walk ahead
4801742 well i mean if you get to know the people youre eliminating it might make work even less enjoyable
4801743 i didnt think it possibly could be no matter how loathsome they are i dont like having to do this over and over
4801744 do you want to see i have it if you want to read it
4801745 putting up with the likes of you i guess go ahead
4801746 wow i must have let out even more than i realized
4801747 then why dont they stop fucking up all the time
4801748 they do keep waking you with their woes dont they
4801749 i just feel sorry for you having to do something so trivial in such a stupid plot over and over again
4801750 youre not the topic of poetry for nothing even senseless man can feel the heaviness in your step i recognized you right away ive seen many hot tired lions with laziness in their movements but none like you
4801751 i cant believe he talked about my thighs ive always been self conscious about them
4801752 can you think of anything have you all this time
4801753 is that all you fantasize about on these long walks
4801754 well i certainly dont fantasize about ravens if thats what youre getting at
4801755 i just mean if you could go another way would you where to
4801756 what are you trying to get me to do what do you think i can just stop and that will change anything that i would just be allowed and unnoticed some things are bigger than we can imagine
4801757 thats just one possibility so what would i do if i wasnt doing whats written
4801758 um what kind of food do you think youd like cooking
4801759 maybe even just kind of settle down with my own pride
4801760 yeah rescue some hot lionesses from some zoo and make them mine
4801761 theyd probably think i was gay because i dont want meat
4801762 or theyd know youd appreciate them for who they are and not their hunting abilities
4801763 i guess i could hide the cooking for a while
4801764 its just something pointless thats your own instead of someone elses
4801765 you could just do that until you got bored and move on to the next boring pointless thing or even come back to this one
4801766 why do you want me to veer so badly do you have something against the writer
4801767 a break from everything we know we dont much care to do
4801768 well am i alone in welcoming that whatever it may be above doing this same old fucking thing over and over again
4801769 great thats on the way of where i was going
4801770 yes whatever i like and ill take full responsibility for where that takes me
4801771 youre a marvel lion i feel exhilarated in your presence right now
4801772 i feel exhilarated now too thanks for the suggestion ive never felt exhilaration before i never even felt thirst before i never felt anything but hot and tired all the time until just a few moments ago these few steps make whatever happens next worthwhile already
4801773 hold on its not even plugged in now just a sec god its early
4801774 come on come on no telling how short this will last
4801775 since when did he start hanging out with a bird
4801776 cool i love watching tv at your place i mean with you
4801777 off the agenda is article 2 of the un charter which bars the threat of force in international affairs both us political parties insistently proclaim their criminality declaring that all options are on the table with regard to irans nuclear programmes
4801778 you should know by now that irritates the heck out of me
4801779 look at the 2004 vote with log cabin openly against bush and the gay democrats in full attack with their vote or die scenarios the vote was still about the same as in 2000 bush still got 20 to 25 percent of the gay vote and kerrys gay vote didnt make a difference one way or the other so this isnt about kidding ourselves that gays matter to either party its about whether gays are positioned to have an impact on the next administration whoever wins
4801780 we all know the sec is the best weve destroyed the best of of the little 12 two years running in the nc game furthermore i might believe the little 12 is getting better when osu defeats an sec opponent in a bowl game since they are what 0 8 vs sec teams keep dreaming
4801781 art is the ability to make something and sell it

4801783 the kiss sculpted by rodin in 1880 1882 this statue requires two people
4801784 the problem is that you will feel hungry later when you are busy and have less access to healthy food
4801785 so you are more likely to reach for a donut
4801786 the problem is that family favorites such as lasagna are often high in fat and calories
4801787 its also a good idea to try to opt for a lower fat version of the family favorite
4801788 eating whatever you want at a restaurant was okay in the days when people ate out only a few times a year
4801789 you need to have some strategies for coping with eating out adopt them religiously so they become habits
4801790 when we snack between meals we often do it standing up or while our attention is focused on something else such as folding the laundry or reading the paper
4801791 i dont eat in the car or while im watching television
4801792 expecting too much weight loss too soon is the biggest diet blunder that people make
4801793 but most people aim for more than that then feel like a failure and give up when they dont reach that unrealistically high goal
4801794 if you really dont believe that one to two pounds amounts to much weight loss go empty out two tubs of margarine onto a plate youll realize how well youre doing

4801805 corporations that focus on immediate results narrow approaches to consumer relationships via traditional push advertising poor product and service performance and fear of the creative process are a the core of the problem

4801809 ah it is not probable he will arrive to night nevertheless leave the table as it is i shall be ready in a quarter of an hour
4801810 monseigneur it is nothing the trees and the night are all that are here
4801811 pardon me i mean not a long time on the journey a long time intending the journey
4801812 i have come back sir as you anticipate pursuing the object that took me away it carried me into great and unexpected peril but it is a sacred object and if it had carried me to death i hope it would have sustained me
4801813 whether if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death you would have cared to stop me there
4801814 for anything i know you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me
4801815 i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means and would know no scruple as to means
4801816 do me the favour to recall that i told you so long ago
4801817 i believe it to be at once your bad fortune and my good fortune that has kept me out of a prison in france here
4801818 i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely
4801819 for the honour of the family i could even resolve to incommode you to that extent pray excuse me
4801820 i perceive that happily for me the reception of the day before yesterday was as usual a cold one
4801821 i would not be sure of that a good opportunity for consideration surrounded by the advantages of solitude might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself but it is useless to discuss the question i am as you say at a disadvantage these little instruments of correction these gentle aids to the power and honour of families these slight favours that might so incommode you are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity they are sought by so many and they are granted comparatively to so few it used not to be so but france in all such things is changed for the worse our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar from this room many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged in the next room my bedroom one fellow to our knowledge was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter his daughter we have lost many privileges a new philosophy has become the mode and the assertion of our station in these days might i do not go so far as to say would but might cause us real inconvenience all very bad very bad
4801822 we have so asserted our station both in the old time and in the modern time also
4801823 that i believe our name to be more detested than any name in france
4801824 detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low
4801825 a face i can look at in all this country round about us which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery
4801826 to the grandeur of the family merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur hah
4801827 repression is the only lasting philosophy the dark deference of fear and slavery my friend
4801828 will keep the dogs obedient to the whip as long as this roof
4801829 we have done wrong and are reaping the fruits of wrong
4801830 our family our honourable family whose honour is of so much account to both of us in such different ways even in my fathers time we did a world of wrong injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure whatever it was why need i speak of my fathers time when it is equally yours can i separate my fathers twin brother joint inheritor and next successor from himself
4801831 bound to a system that is frightful to me responsible for it but powerless in it seeking to execute the last request of my dear mothers lips and obey the last look of my dear mothers eyes which implored me to have mercy and to redress and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain
4801832 my friend i will die perpetuating the system under which i have lived
4801833 and accept your natural destiny but you are lost monsieur charles i see
4801834 are they both yours to renounce france may be but is the property it is scarcely worth mentioning but is it yet
4801835 i had no intention in the words i used to claim it yet
4801836 which i have the vanity to hope is not probable
4801837 i would abandon it and live otherwise and elsewhere it is little to relinquish what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin
4801838 to the eye it is fair enough here but seen in its integrity under the sky and by the daylight it is a crumbling tower of waste mismanagement extortion debt mortgage oppression hunger nakedness and suffering
4801839 if it ever becomes mine it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly if such a thing is possible from the weight that drags it down so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance may in another generation suffer less but it is not for me there is a curse on it and on all this land
4801840 forgive my curiosity do you under your new philosophy graciously intend to live
4801841 i must do to live what others of my countrymen even with nobility at their backs may have to do some day work
4801842 yes the family honour sir is safe from me in this country the family name can suffer from me in no other for i bear it in no other
4801843 england is very attractive to you seeing how indifferently you have prospered there
4801844 i have already said that for my prospering there i am sensible i may be indebted to you sir for the rest it is my refuge
4801845 a doctor with a daughter yes so commences the new philosophy you are fatigued good night
4801846 i look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning good repose light monsieur my nephew to his chamber there and burn monsieur my nephew in his bed if you will

4801849 en la inequidad en el tratamiento de aquellas provincias que poseen formaciones vegetales de bosques nativos y la penalizaci n de la actividad en torno a bosques cultivados sin importar la calidad de los mismos y las estrategias generales de conservaci n y manejo que estas realicen
4801850 est muy bien que se proponga que para acceder a los beneficios de la ley 25 080 al momento de realizar nuevas plantaciones se deba cumplir tambi n con lo dispuesto en la ley de bosques
4801851 muchos empresarios deforestaban un bosque nativo para replantar rboles ex ticos y as poder acceder a las exenciones y beneficios que establece la ley
4801852 de esa manera no s lo se alteraba el ecosistema de la regi n sino que adem s el estado terminaba sin quererlo financiando la deforestaci n de bosques nativos y su reemplazo por plantaciones ex ticas
4801853 el objetivo de estas pr cticas era plantar rboles ex ticos de crecimiento m s r pido para abastecer el mercado maderero y la industria de papel celulosa el eucalipto por ejemplo tarda diez a os en alcanzar un estado ptimo para la tala menos de la mitad que el promedio de los rboles aut ctonos
4801854 la aprobaci n de esta pr rroga resulta fundamental para fomentar el crecimiento y desarrollo del sector forestal desde la producci n primaria hasta la industrializaci n
4801855 alrededor de 42 mil empleos rurales y 30 mil empleos industriales en primera transformaci n que cerca de 15 mil productores accedieron a los beneficios de esta ley y que se otorgaron aportes no reintegrables para unas 370 mil hect reas de forestaci n
4801856 ventas de madera por 2 7 mil millones de d lares en rollos y 18 mil millones de d lares en las ventas de madera industrializada en primera transformaci n
4801857 el sector forestal en su fase industrial y comercial cobr un dinamismo inusitado a partir del cual la producci n de todos los derivados de la madera se increment y las exportaciones lo hicieron incluso en mayor cuant a sin embargo el sector primario no ha logrado acompa ar ese crecimiento y en la actualidad el proceso en t rminos netos es negativo es decir que se extrae m s madera de la que se implanta
4801858 en los primeros periodos de la ley se sancion en 1999 el ritmo de implantaci n respondi din micamente al incentivo pero a nadie escapa que poco tiempo despu s argentina se vio sumida en una de las peores crisis econ micas de su historia lo que implic no s lo un freno del flujo de las inversiones en este sector sino tambi n problemas financieros del gobierno nacional que impidieron el normal funcionamiento de este r gimen de promoci n
4801859 las inversiones realizadas en 2000 y 2002 fueron reintegradas con fuertes retrasos lo que llev a la desconfianza en el r gimen y a la fuerte reducci n de la cantidad de nuevos proyectos y consecuentemente de la superficie aprobadas hasta 2003

4801864 we had built the sets and designed costumes but we couldnt seem to find a sonic screwdriver anywhere as the play is about time travel we really needed the prop which is seen in doctor who shows
4801865 everyone at pontlliw players is over the moon with the prop now weve got everything in place we cant wait for the show to begin
4801866 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
4801867 vedere il mondo in un grano di sabbia e un cielo in un fiore tenere linfinito nel palmo della tua mano e leternit in unora
4801868 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys

4801870 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
4801871 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
4801872 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
4801873 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
4801874 a police officer could do the same thing with his or her own eyes
4801875 it helps to cut down on the number of police officers who would have to be out tracking particular cars
4801876 while it may be true that police can conduct surveillance of people on a public street without violating their rights tracking a person everywhere they go and keeping a computer record of it for days and days without that person knowing is a completely different type of intrusion
4801877 things that would have seemed fantastic 15 years ago are now routine
4801878 we have to rethink what is a reasonable expectation of privacy
4801879 the issue is whether the more sophisticated tools are doing the same things we used to do or are creating a different set of legal circumstances
4801880 i urge anyone who reads their blogs to question everything they write especially kowalski who has a history of blogging anything he wants without facts or substantiation other than rumor and his feelings make sure you read carefully for proof and evidence if theyre going to attack and smear someone theyd better have the goods they need to back up anything they say when they write about this in the future or risk a complete loss of credibility

4801884 the ground was almost literally covered with vines producing the greatest profusion of delicious grapes and hanging in such endless clusters our progress was oftentimes completely arrested by hundreds of acres of small plum trees every bush that was in sight was so loaded with the weight of its fruit that they were in many instances literally without leaves on their branches and quite bent to the ground and beds of wild currants gooseberries and edible prickly pear
4801885 nearly half of all the plant foods grown in the world today were first cultivated by the american indians and were unknown elsewhere until the discovery of the americas
4801886 the u s dietary guidelines as they exist are really a fundamental form of institutionalized racism in a rather destructive and insidious format

4801890 its a giant science experiment on air pollution as far as i know its the biggest case where a city that had air quality problems took strong measures to improve air quality theyve taken it very seriously its exciting from a science standpoint
4801891 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than l a or atlanta
4801892 its not just about china its about megacities across the world whats learned here can perhaps be applied to other cities

4801900 rapper papoose has confirmed that he and incarcerated girlfriend and fellow rapper remy ma are married the pair was reportedly making plans to exchange nuptials at new yorks rikers island jail in may while remy was awaiting sentencing for her part in a july 2007 shooting
4801901 actually that has nothing to do with the case that was just the date
4801902 well its funny i was at lucasarts a lot during e3 and it was the forefront of what we were talking about i mean obviously this year we cant since the device isnt coming out yet and force and clone are both hitting by thanksgiving so thats out of the question with the other stuff were working on now though were definitely looking to incorporate it so i think next year its going to be really really cool youre right though the 1 1 control is on everybodys lips now and yeah not this year but for next year were definitely working on something ill leave it at that
4801903 well were doing at least two more wii titles for next year maybe three
4801904 we do feel let down do you blame us what happened to our allies we do not know what will happen in the future but it looks like we may lose parts of our country
4801905 ossetians are killing poor georgians this is a problem and we are trying to deal with it
4801906 we have nothing left and we cannot go back home our lives have been destroyed and i do not think our government or america can change that
4801907 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
4801908 who invited the trouble here who invited the arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here not only those who perpetrated it but those who allowed it to happen
4801909 culture of peace with justice and tolerance for all people as opposed to the culture of death

4801911 american troops would join the polish military at least temporarily at the front lines facing east toward russia
4801912 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4801913 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4801914 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4801915 the usa is busy with its own missile defense system
4801916 it does not intend to defend poland at this point poland lays itself open to attack by giving the usa permission to deploy the system the country may become an object of russias reaction such targets are destroyed in the first instance
4801917 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4801918 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4801919 it is inconceivable that the americans were unaware of georgias mobilization and intentions it is also inconceivable that the americans were unaware that the russians had deployed substantial forces on the south ossetian frontier us technical intelligence from satellite imagery and signals intelligence to unmanned aerial vehicles could not miss the fact that thousands of russian troops were moving to forward positions
4801920 particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
4801921 the days of satellites and spheres of influence are behind us
4801922 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4801927 in the earliest wave of pioneers in any new disruptive platform the marginal and the dispossessed are over represented not the sole constituents by any means but people who feel they dont fit who have nothing left to lose or who were impelled by some kind of dream who may be outsiders to whatever mainstream they are coming from all come and arrive early in disproportionate numbers that sort of arduous frontier conditions really give these environments their charm and their character that is going to make things challenging for people who feel that as the frontier is being settled and there is less novelty and in some senses less freedom it is always an uneasy transition for the pioneers
4801928 it was the way the west in the u s was settled it is the way second life has been settled
4801929 in a more decentralized kind of way one that thomas jefferson if he were around would be proud of
4801930 reos properties foreclosed and now owned by lenders continue to be a driving force for much of the entry level market in silicon valley and this seems to be where much of the pulse of the market remains
4801931 this is quite remarkable considering that this time last year was close to 900 pendings of sfrs and 330 pendings of condos townhomes we now have nearly double the sales wow
4801932 israel exported failed generals in order to train the georgian armed forces including general gal hirsch and we all know that the georgian army was defeated by the russian forces

4801967 hoy el bienestar en la vida de la sociedad occidental ha comenzado a revelar su perniciosa m scara
4801968 la defensa de los derechos individuales ha llegado a tales extremos que ha hecho a la sociedad en s indefensa contra ciertos individuos ya es hora en occidente de defender no tanto los derechos humanos como las obligaciones humanas
4801969 se le ha dado espacio ilimitado a la libertad destructiva e irresponsable la sociedad parece tener poca defensa contra el abismo de la decadencia humana como por ejemplo el mal uso de la libertad para la violencia moral entre los j venes pel culas llenas de pornograf a crimen y horror

4801981 im not sure where john mayer learned his vocal craft i hesitate to call it singing its more like whimpering and for some reason this has become a trend not stopping anytime soon
4801982 who else can take a love song and turn it into a hernia when a man loves a woman he doesnt do so by screaming in her ear so why should it be acceptable for a man to sing a sensitive love song as if hes directing traffic for the hearing impaired r amp b classics deserve their place in musical history and should be protected from this mans desecration of all that is holy its only right lets make it a law

4801987 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4801988 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4801989 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4801990 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4801991 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4802001 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4802002 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4802003 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing

4802044 albers in the conclusion of fifty years of linear algebra you wrote i am inclined to believe that at the root of all deep mathematics there is a combinatorial insight i think that in this subject in every subject the really original really deep insights are always combinatorial and i think for the new discoveries that we need the pendulum needs to swing back and will swing back in the combinatorial direction i always thought of you as an analyst halmos people call me an analyst but i think im a born algebraist and i mean the same thing analytic versus combinatorial algebraic i think the finite case illustrates and guides and simplifies the infinite some people called me full of baloney when i asserted that the deep problems of operator theory could all be solved if we knew the answer to every finite dimensional matrix question i still have this religion that if you knew the answer to every matrix question somehow you could answer every operator question but the somehow would require genius the problem is not given an operator question to ask the same question in finite dimensions thats silly the problem is the genius is given an infinite question to think of the right finite question to ask once you thought of the finite answer then you would know the right answer to the infinite question combinatorics the finite case is where the genuine deep insight is generalizing making it infinite is sometimes intricate and sometimes difficult and i might even be willing to say that its sometimes deep but it is nowhere near as fundamental as seeing the finite structure

4802076 i just dont see this as being as much of a breakthrough as i thought it would be
4802077 a lot of people dont take pride in their defense and dont tip their hat to guys that go out and stick their nose in there and play hard on defense

4802090 he added that the elections clearly show that cambodia is politically stable which is the main factor to develop the economy and some other continuing changing political components that can contribute to promote the economic development of cambodia on the international arena are the rising value of agricultural products and the growth of tourism
4802091 he continued to say the three big components that i mentioned above are strong forces for the current cambodian economy
4802092 mr sok sina an economist said that the 2008 elections were different from 2003 these elections will not put cambodia into a crisis like the previous one
4802093 he went on to say i cannot see any political forces which would affect the process attracting foreign investors and the economic development

4802104 the most important thing about the preseason is finding ways to win ball games and that is what we did it started to look pretty bleak there at the end but the guys stepped up and made the plays ingle martin did a nice job executing the two minute drive we kicked the field goal and got the win
4802105 we played all right it certainly wasnt anything special we have a lot of things to work on and have to do a better job of getting first downs and extending drives we have to convert third and short and also catch the ball we all have things to work on
4802106 i couldnt get in a rhythm like i wanted to i had my reasons right and things like that but i just have got to complete the ball thats basically it i have to continue to keep working as a receiver core we got to just get the team to keep working on the little things thats basically it but on my part my reasons and everything were right i just got to complete the ball thats basically it

4802193 its a factor for all of these athletes you have to execute under pressure the punter we have its going to be a guy we trust thats going to be the key after these five preseason games jim and i will sit down and its got to be a guy he can trust
4802194 is he into the game is he talking to himself when you look into his eyes does he have that hollow i call it the fish look with the mouth agape and the eyes staring i havent seen that in either one of these punters
4802195 ive got a lot to work on obviously but for my first game in the nfl somebody asked me how id grade myself and i said b b minus i think i did some good things
4802196 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website
4802197 well all right tea cake ah wants tuh go wid you real bad but oh tea cake dont make no false pretense wid me
4802198 janie ah hope god may kill me if ahm lyin nobody else on earth kin hold uh candle tuh you baby you got de keys to de kingdom
4802199 we are appealing to the national conference the pdp and the congress to join us otherwise we will call for their boycott
4802200 we demand that the srinagar muzaffarabad road be opened immediately so that people can trade their goods across the loc we also demand that all roads going to pakistan occupied kashmir and pakistan be opened immediately
4802201 as there are clear skies it seems that we all can witness a full event
4802202 he took all of his bad habits and utilized them to his advantage he didnt have great placement for instance he didnt have clean use of his arms so hed detract from that by wearing gloves he didnt have a strong turn out in his legs so hed turn in instead
4802203 he transformed all of his habits even the way he walked you know how fosse dancers tend to lean back with their tail tucked under thats supposedly how he walked and im not quite sure but i think maybe he didnt have a particularly good hairline and thats why he always wore a hat
4802204 hidden bias to responsible bias an approach to information systems based on haraways situated knowledges
4802205 he used to work in wipro and he along with mufti abu bashir are the masterminds behind the blasts
4802206 in ahmedabad mechanical clocks were used and in surat integrated chips were used but the chips did not work due to some technical fault
4802207 that was a thrilling moment the more burials you do the more you get used to the mechanics of dealing with the remains but there is still a human context to your reaction
4802208 we are looking at the bones of an individual and you can see them as a whole person
4802209 i am not going to throw the towel in no matter how difficult it gets
4802210 i think it is obvious looking at the lap times where the problems are but im not going to complain about anybody
4802211 it is my job to go out there and do the best job on the package i have got right now and thats what i will do but if not all of the elements of the package come together then it becomes very difficult
4802212 it was very tough out there and thats all i can really say
4802213 starting from where i am it is going to be a very difficult race but as always i will give it my best shot for tech 3 and yamaha
4802214 the conditions were really tough out there and to be honest we didnt expect so much rain that fell in the last part of the session i started the session on a rear tyre that was probably too hard but we needed to get out and get some information for michelin
4802215 by the time id put the softer tyre in the rain was unbelievable that didnt help my situation but im not sure i could have improved a lot more if the rain was less and it would have been easy to take too many risks and crash
4802216 but it was a bit like germany a few weeks ago when i had a few issues in the wet race i was just trying to find consistent grip that gave me the confidence to push and i was lacking in that area
4802217 if it is dry tomorrow like the forecasts say then hopefully we can get some good information in the warm up and put up a good fight in the race
4802218 i wasnt trying to make up big chunks of time because it was impossible in those conditions and i went down for no reason and that is disappointing
4802219 its nice to take the lead of the championship with two rounds to go i just have to hold onto it now
4802220 es hora de retar al pp en primer lugar a que pida disculpas por todo lo que dijo de la financiaci n de catalu a prevista en su estatuto de autonom a y en segundo lugar que retire el recurso al estatuto en el tribunal constitucional

4802222 sucede que todav a no hay un acuerdo sobre c mo debe cumplirse esa previsi n del estatuto el gobierno tiene una idea que todav a no es compartida aunque buscamos el m nimo com n denominador posible que haga viable cumplir con las previsiones del estatuto y mejorar la financiaci n de las comunidades aut nomas
4802223 los partidos de catalu a se cuestionaran el apoyo a los presupuestos
4802224 que se aprueben los presupuestos es la garant a de que se puede abordar un nuevo modelo de financiaci n si no hay presupuestos nuevos no habr un nuevo modelo de financiaci n por lo tanto catalu a saldr perdiendo igual que el resto de comunidades aut nomas
4802225 ya que los catalanes no entender an c mo se puede negar el apoyo a unos presupuestos que van a ser mejores para catalu a

4802376 nosotros hemos dicho que colombia no tiene conflicto interno armado y entonces voy a explicar que es una cosa t cnica es que el derecho internacional humanitario desarroll un concepto de guerra interna o de conflicto armado interno para distinguirlo de los conflictos armados entre pa ses entonces cuando dice el presidente nosotros no tenemos conflicto armado interno est diciendo que los elementos con los cuales se define la existencia de un conflicto armado interno en colombia no existen primero la existencia de un partido pol tico en armas cu l partido pol tico en armas o la existencia de un movimiento pol tico o social o econ mico segundo el control territorial pero no control territorial en el sentido de que yo estoy en la selva

4802387 this success shows what a government determined to deal firmly with the menace of terrorism can achieve it stands in sharp contrast with the utter lack of clarity and will power of the upa government
4802388 i heartily congratulate the government of gujarat and the state police in particular for the important breakthrough they have achieved in busting a pan india terrorist network responsible for the serial blasts
4802389 i take this opportunity to once again demand that the upa government recommend immediate presidential assent for the gujarat control of organised crime act which has been pending with the centre since june 2004

4802402 the norms of growth and investment rates in new industries
4802403 2050 only a few hundred gwe seem possible for this new or for practically any new ssion technology which is about equal to the present world nuclear capacity
4802404 the number of light water reactor lwr can grow some but quickly is limited by fuel limitations and waste management
4802405 600 000 tons of proven thorium oxide reserves various estimates indicate additional probable reserves of as much as 1 8 million tons or more of thorium oxide contained within these claims
4802406 vein deposits of thorite thsio 4 such as those that occur in the area of the lemhi pass present the highest grade thorium mineral and are believed to contain approximately 25 to 63 percent thorium oxide tho 2 per ton of raw ore thus one ton of thorium ore could potentially yield as much as 500 1 200 lbs of high grade thorium oxide tho 2 as compared with less than one percent of raw uranium ore that is typically utilizable the deployment of lemhi pass thorium represents a more economically feasible source of nuclear grade ore than uranium deposits
4802407 the core size is related to factory manufacture of the vessel and transportation to the reactor site which is a favorable factor for diameters up to about 5m at 10m the constructionis likely an expensive eld operation or more elaborate transportation to the site by barge for example
4802408 in the course of development of the msr and during the early deployment of the rst few power plants the size of the vessel will not be a concern but extensive deployment is expected to be highly driven by market pull
4802409 the msr has so many favorable features many discussed here that one is at a loss to explain why the reactor has not already been developed once a program has been killed there is a stigma attached that creates a legacy of its own several decades ago reactor accidents low number of orders for new reactors low uranium prices and low cost natural gas have discouraged reactor development such as the msr but all these things have reversed i strongly recommend independent thinkers to re look at and invest in the msr china and india could take on this task to their great advantage even a philanthropist or venture capitalist could breathe new life into this concept as mall 10mwe or even much smaller test reactor would provide relevant information useful to proceeding on to a commercial power reactor and represents a low risk low cost rst step

4802620 we were looking for books trying to find a source of inspiration
4802621 nick wantland the groups drummer stumbled upon this book that we had in our house it was called an index of possibilities energy and power its pretty much about everything and we found this article on ed mitchell
4802622 when mitchell saw the earth from so far away he called it instant global awareness seeing the world as a whole community as opposed to small communities and he experienced a kind of depression he called it cosmic depression
4802623 our cosmology from science our understanding of ourselves who we are and how did we get here is incomplete and possibly flawed and that our cultural expression maybe religion our cultural cosmology is archaic and certainly flawed
4802624 originally the album was going to be called the ed mitchell clinic for cosmic depression
4802625 a lot of the songs have more to do with cosmic realities and universal dilemmas that everyone can relate to
4802626 being able to take a few steps back and look at the big picture helps the listener interpret the songs for his or herself
4802627 were not exactly telling them what the songs are about we dont write topical songs its open for interpretation and i think thats part of the cosmic appeal
4802628 its not like we play theremins or make space noises but i feel like its a little more psychedelic or i guess you could call it spacey
4802629 we have a lot of spaced out rhythms we dont record to a click track we did that on purpose so that things seem a little more chaotic so you get more of a cosmic feel
4802630 the ep was recorded just in bedrooms and random places
4802631 it was more of a mish mash you know stuff so we could throw up some songs on the myspace or whatever we never really sat down and mapped it out like this new album this new one had a lot more construction
4802632 weve been having van problems and sleeping in lobbies for like three days and were still having a really great time

4802646 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
4802647 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy

4802651 they that be in the mountains shall die of hunger and eat their own flesh and drink their own blood for very hunger of bread and thirst of water
4802652 and the children of israel said unto them would to god we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger
4802653 and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst
4802654 and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them
4802655 they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor sun smite them for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them even by the springs of water shall he guide them
4802656 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled
4802657 and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst
4802658 who is that righteousness for which the blessed hunger and thirst
4802659 therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head
4802660 even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place
4802661 they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat
4802662 heavens and earth shall be rolled up as a scroll

4802670 learn some facts of the lives and works of the following authors
4802671 without giving it all much thought i wrote the exam it wasnt even particularly troublesome ah what a pain it is to study for nothing
4802672 saya sudah berkeliling ke daerah lain semua masyarakat mengeluhkan kondisi sekarang pada saya siapa suruh waktu itu mereka tidak memilih saya
4802673 jadi kalau sekarang rakyat susah itu karena tidak memilih saya tapi malah pilih yang ganteng ganteng para kaum wanita banyak yang tidak punya pendirian padahal kalau susah wanitalah yang pertama merasakan
4802674 entah kenapa saya kok tak cocok dan tak percaya pada partai politik
4802675 baik yang namanya pemilu legislatif pilpres maupun pilkada saya golput jadi orang orang ramai mendatangi tps saya justru santai santai di rumah
4802676 iya lah harus dibedakan meski demo tapi soal aspirasi politik orang pun boleh lain lain kan
4802677 saya itu ingin ikut demo yang chaos sampai lempar lemparan batu seperti di jakarta jakarta itu lho namun saya tidak pernah boleh ikut oleh pak luko ketua pemuda pusura luko djojo red
4802678 kalau risikonya cukup besar dan kemungkinan bentrok tinggi tentu saya tak akan memperbolehkan
4802679 tentunya demo yang kami lakukan selalu terukur kami tak mungkin meminta partisipasi mai untuk demo yang berdarah darah seperti itu
4802680 keluarga itu memang luar biasa ibunya itu marsiyah red bahkan sampai harus dilarang larang supaya tidak ikut demonstrasi kalau ditinggal demo merayunya harus sampai lama
4802681 badan kehormatan bk menghentikan proses evaluasi terhadap grup band slank pimpinan bk sudah bertemu dengan pimpinan dpr tadinya pimpinan akan melanjutkan hal ini ke komisi iii bidang hukum kami meminta kesadaran masyarakat sendiri coba lihat bait ke tiga lagu tersebut hal itu menyinggung kaum perempuan
4802682 bisa juga terlihat ketika terjadi keributan demonstran bayaran biasanya langsung kacau dan semburat melarikan diri
4802683 sepengetahuan saya bukan demonstrasi tapi advokasi bagi saya itu adalah improvisasi dari demonstrasi itu
4802684 kalau untuk pressure group saya lebih condong menyebutnya advokasi itu tidak salah karena merupakan bagian dari strategi aksi aksi seperti itu seharusnya berada di bawah biro hukum sebuah organisasi
4802685 kalau ada orang berkerumun membawa poster dan meneriakkan tuntutan tuntutan bagi kami itu tetap demonstrasi dan kami memperlakukannya sama entah itu demonstrasi entah itu advokasi
4802686 tiap kali order massa tak kurang 200 sampai 300 orang bisa dia siapkan bahkan ketika mendadak sekalipun
4802687 ya ketika saya masuk pusura di sana saya belajar banyak dari cak luko djojo semuanya boleh dikata dialah yang membuat saya mengetahui banyak hal
4802688 saya sudah yakin karena teman saya cukup banyak boleh dibilang saya ini dulu suka keluyuran selain itu teman kerja saya juga saya ajak
4802689 ya saya langsung bilang ayo ikut mau dapat uang atau tidak
4802690 itu jumlah yang lumayan sekarang begini saja kerja cuma tiga jam berteriak sekali sekali terus pulang dapat rp 30 ribu bayangkan mbecak berapa lama untuk mendapatkan uang sebanyak itu
4802691 mau mengemukakan pendapat apa saja boleh bahkan kami blak blakan
4802692 ma gak onok demo maneh ta ma tidak ada demo lagi kah
4802693 saya tidak ingat bulannya ketika itu bapak luko djojo red order 200 warga pada malam hari padahal rencana demo sudah dilakukan besok siangnya repot juga kalau malam malam
4802694 saat itu saya memanjat pagar merayu polisi yang berjaga untuk memberi makanan dan ternyata saya diberi nasi bungkus seplastik besar
4802695 timbang diamuk wong wong mending tak jalukno polisi ae mangane daripada dimarahi orang orang lebih baik saya memintakan saja ke polisi red
4802696 polisinya sudah tua pangkatnya kecil jelek lagi dia merayu yuniar bukannya menata demonstran tapi malah menggoda goda dia bilang yuniar manis
4802697 biasa lah kalau demo itu ada polisi yang sedikit ganjen menggoda demonstran perempuan yang cantik
4802698 penginnya sih tiap hari ada order demo tapi itu kan tidak mungkin bagi saya ini adalah kerja sambilan namun saya serius menekuninya
4802699 yang jelas sepanjang tidak merugikan orang lain dan membantu para penganggur yang banyak terdapat di lingkungan kami saya baik baik saja saya tak terlalu memusingkan apa pun pendapat orang
4802700 minimal bisa memberi lapangan pekerjaan bagi para pengangguran meski tak bisa rutin

4802748 but these guys worked hard in the offseason the training went well everybody came out here to training camp took it well not complaining just getting the job done trying to make things better and trying to get better that shows me that people around here arent just reading the papers and believing the hype
4802749 a lot of people ask why they dont see him yelling at us he doesnt seem to be all hyped but behind closed doors he gives us that edge if he has to get us in line by cussing us out or getting us in order he does it but he makes sure on the field hes poised
4802750 i scored a touchdown my first touchdown my rookie year everybodys giving me fives i was all tired sitting there on the bench he comes over and says son is someone replacing you on kickoff coverage i grabbed my helmet and ran back out there
4802751 hes a faster returner than i am but i feel like im a great returner the stats speak for themselves ive heard his interviews he does his talking on the field hes one of the best if not the best but i have to give it to myself look at the stats if you look at nfl com and you type in kick returner and see whos at the top of the list its me
4802752 you have a high powered offense like we do who wouldnt want to start at the 40
4802753 i mean come on now were two first downs away from a field goal were scoring every time and if you look at the league we were eighth in scoring and i like to think i had a lot to do with that being that 12th man
4802754 when rac got here it took a little while but his mindset is about winning football games
4802755 and hes been around the nfl for 30 something years actually 28 he knows what hes doing and we got savage and he brings these players in its been a long process and were here now
4802756 if its not good enough you look at whats wrong and what i need to fix to make it better
4802757 and then if you can fix it and get it better then you win

4802780 is it age or the loss of a loved one that draws an anti narrative poet to beginnings at the end
4802781 hes violating a basic principle of his poetry which keeps him very much alive and hes allowed to move into a different kind of poetics in order to do that and that freedom is moving its almost elegiac its almost a way of saying farewell to a style

4802787 letter to my granddaughter on the eve of another war
4802788 now russia needs to honor that agreement and withdraw its forces and of course military operations
4802789 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4802790 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4802791 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states fully recognizes this reality
4802792 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done but i would just note there are already consequences
4802793 there have been universal concern within the eu european union the united states about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4802794 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4802795 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4802796 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4802797 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4802798 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4802799 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4802800 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis

4802928 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4802929 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4802930 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4802931 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4802932 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4802933 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4802934 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4802935 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4802936 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4802937 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4802938 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4802939 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4802940 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4802941 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4802942 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4802943 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4802944 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4802945 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4802946 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4802947 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4802948 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4802949 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4802950 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4802951 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4802952 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4802953 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4802954 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4802955 mik n ei viittaa siihen ett ven l iset olisivat vet ytym ss
4802956 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4802957 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4802958 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4802959 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4802960 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4802961 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4802962 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4802963 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4802964 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4802965 this is a planning took where all things are going
4802966 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4802967 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4802968 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4802969 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4802970 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4802971 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4802972 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4802973 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4802974 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4802975 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4802976 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4802977 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4802978 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4802979 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4802980 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4802981 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4802982 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4802983 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4802984 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4802985 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4802986 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4802987 aaaabi you look good hich deyishmemishsin walla billa except the hair

4802990 debemos tomar junto a las estrategias que se est n manejando en materia de capacitaci n servicio civil de carrera mejores remuneraciones equipamiento tecnolog a y coordinaci n de los cuerpos policiales

4802992 es muy importante que la sociedad se exprese y si hay una enorme preocupaci n y repudio por el incremento de los secuestros y hechos tr gicos que hemos vivido es importante que la sociedad utilice esos canales que le garantiza la constituci n
4802993 ive never had any experience even remotely close to what i had in beijing last fall
4802994 its like its a weird bronchial spasm thing that i was getting that just like whenever you tried to take enough breath to give your muscles that fuel of oxygen they need your bronchioles just start spasming and you just like physically cant do it and its like akin to drowning or something just not being able to take that full breath and you know having your body really require that oxygen and not being able to get it is a pretty unique and pretty terrifying situation i think
4802995 the current world champion and the current olympic champion julien absalon same deal about the same point in the race 20 or 30 minutes in actually was sick to his stomach and threw up and was hacking and wheezing and had to pull out and yes i think there were 46 starters and eight finishers so thats a pretty high attrition rate for a two hour mountain bike race around a fairly easy course
4802996 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4802997 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4802998 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4802999 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4803000 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4803001 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4803002 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4803003 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4803004 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4803005 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4803006 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4803007 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4803008 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4803009 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4803010 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4803011 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4803012 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4803013 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4803014 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4803015 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4803016 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4803017 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4803018 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4803019 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4803020 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4803021 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4803022 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4803023 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4803024 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4803025 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4803026 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4803027 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4803028 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4803029 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4803030 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4803031 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4803032 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4803033 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4803034 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4803035 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4803036 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4803037 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4803038 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible

4803522 well ive fallen in love with wait did i just say ive fallen in love
4803523 what did i just grin at the thought of omg
4803524 so how do you see this being implemented here in our archdiocese
4803525 ok so what would you do if you could do anything
4803526 its all mysterious how people respond we cant program it
4803527 well i dont know if coming in and making changes is the best approach you know

4803531 its pretty amazing to be a part of something so big
4803532 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4803533 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4803534 it is solely intended to provide political cover to democrats that are losing more ground by the day on this issue
4803535 the main reason i have come across is that people are either older and want to protect their own assets or they have been through a separation before and they want to make sure they are protected
4803536 people are more savvy these days perhaps they have less expectation that their relationship is going to last forever
4803537 the finance part is the binding part but many people think they might as well work out lifestyle clauses
4803538 it wouldnt surprise me if fidelity or weight was a clause it depends on the personalities involved and the relative positions of those involved
4803539 we just thought it makes good sense that in the event of a separation not that we think its going to happen that what we bought into the relationship is protected
4803540 many people are turning to us because theyve worked with agents for six to 12 months and they need to change direction
4803541 hiring an agent is a luxury that many people cannot afford
4803542 the odds have not been worse in my memory for someone to try and do it themselves
4803543 if i were going to list with an agent i would have added another 10 percent to the price
4803544 but i realize by doing that it would put me in a price bracket thats higher and would eliminate some potential buyers who wouldnt qualify for the higher mortgage
4803545 ive done my homework i know what else is out there and i know i have the best value on the market
4803546 if it takes 10 weeks of open houses every sunday then so be it
4803547 the reason we went on our own was to save ourselves the margin the commission
4803548 but there is a certain point where my time and my wifes time are worth something and we feel that all the time and effort we put into it on our own we could have had somebody else doing it for us the cost will be about the same
4803549 the unconscious mind was a mere assumption for the sake of convenience
4803550 in reality i am totally unconscious of in other words i do not know at all where a voice in a dream originates
4803551 there is only one condition under which you might legitimately call the voice your own namely when you assume your conscious personality to be a part of a whole or to be a smaller circle contained in a bigger one
4803552 human personality consists of two things first of consciousness and whatever this covers and second of an indefinitely large hinterland of unconscious psyche
4803553 if asked i shall surely stand by my convictions which do not go further than what i consider to be my actual knowledge i am convinced of what i know everything else is hypothesis and beyond that i can leave a lot of things to the unknown they do not bother me but they would begin to bother me i am sure if i felt that i ought to know something about them
4803554 if god didnt make the world then how did it get here you dont know
4803555 as long as such a defense works i shall not break it down since i know that there must be powerful reasons why the patient has to think in such a narrow circle
4803556 it would be a regrettable mistake if anybody should understand my observations to be a kind of proof of the existence of god they prove only the existence of an archetypal image of the deity which to my mind is the most we can assert psychologically about god
4803557 normal for a man to resist the unconscious with all those tendencies and contents hitherto excluded from conscious life they were excluded for a number of real and apparent reasons some are suppressed and some are repressed
4803558 freud has discovered repression as one of the main mechanisms in the making of neurosis suppression may cause worry conflict and suffering but never causes a neurosis of one of the usual patterns
4803559 if an inferiority is conscious one always has a chance to correct it furthermore it is constantly in contact with other interests so that it is steadily subjected to modifications but if it is repressed and isolated from consciousness it never gets corrected it is moreover liable to burst forth in a moment of unawareness at all events it forms an unconscious snag blocking the most well meaning attempts
4803560 if such a case wants to be cured it is necessary to find a way in which mans conscious personality and his shadow can live together
4803561 why have the antique gods lost their prestige and their effect upon human souls it was because the olympic gods had served their time and a new mystery began god became man
4803562 collectives are mere accumulations of individuals their problems are also accumulations of individual problems they are only solved by a general change of attitude and the change does not begin with propaganda and mass meetings or with violence it begins with a change in individuals it will continue as a transformation of their personal likes and dislikes of their outlook on life and of their values and only the accumulation of such individual changes will produce a collective solution
4803563 if you sum up what people tell you about their experience you can formulate it about in this way they came to themselves they could accept themselves they were able to become reconciled to themselves and by this they were also reconciled to adverse circumstances and events this is much like what was formerly expressed by saying he has made his peace with god he has sacrificed his own will he has submitted himself to the will of god
4803564 an intelligent woman with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned
4803565 he had a high position and the power to save her he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family
4803566 we all knew he was the only man friend of kim soo im he slept in the house many times the baby looks like the father
4803567 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
4803568 the korean police at the time were notorious for fabricating evidence that didnt exist
4803569 it was truly an emotional moment for me to hear him say it
4803570 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
4803571 came to her begging her to save her my mother
4803572 a very gentle kind of soul honest in his own way a very anticommunist and conservative christian

4803600 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4803601 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4803602 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4803603 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4803604 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4803614 never had any interest myself but i am interested in what you like about it tell me more about that
4803615 my intention was just to ask what people like about the us
4803616 i wouldnt want to live or study in either one of them
4803617 we had recovered about 40 vehicles from eight persons working with car theft gangs and on the basis of information received from them had sent a team to madhya pradesh who are there
4803618 iraqi security forces will partner with the 41st fires brigade and occupy several checkpoints and patrol bases previously manned by the 1st georgian brigade
4803619 right now the iraqi soldiers have taken over the responsibility of the traffic control point but we are going to train them to be able to take over the entire patrol base
4803620 the georgian forces had no experience they didnt know how to fight they didnt follow army orders thats why their duties were to man checkpoints and search cars
4803621 the departure of the georgians is a good thing theyre just the same as the other occupation forces the iraqi forces are quite capable of taking care of security
4803622 i do not get the email re brewster library other than you think it would
4803623 we are appealing to the national conference the pdp and the congress to join us otherwise we will call for their boycott

4803658 have your bosses issue statements pointing out that speaker pelosis energy plan is not an all of the above answer to our energy crisis nor will it take all of the necessary steps overwhelmingly supported by the american people

4803661 theyve blocked every attempt to move responsible incentives for renewable energy the question now is whether cooler heads have prevailed
4803662 its amazing that after months of congressional debate about high gas prices democrats are still more committed to blaming others for their inaction than they are actually doing something to reduce the price of gas
4803663 america faces a choice a continuation of the bush cheney mccain approach that perpetuates the failed policies that have produced soaring prices
4803664 or a comprehensive bipartisan strategy that develops new and traditional sources of energy
4803665 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the democrats utter inaction on this issue trumps their newfound hollow support for the very reforms republicans have been promoting all year long

4803898 his message has content to be communicated authoritatively and persuasively and paul encapsulates the entire content of his message in a single word or more precisely a single person
4803899 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4803900 why when others had done the same or in some cases much worse did they remain intact
4803901 we have achieved our goal which was to get both cars onto the front row starting from pole is especially important here since the first turn is very tight and it is easier to defend from in front during the early part of the race as is frequently the case in the le mans series traffic promises to be a problem we will need to tread carefully and avoid brushing the slower cars as we pass them which is what happened to me this morning the team has once again done a fantastic job and our car is very nicely balanced
4803902 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming
4803903 take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes
4803904 ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor print any marks upon you i am the lord
4803905 what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods
4803906 and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them
4803907 you are the sons of the lord your god you shall not cut yourselves or make any baldness on your foreheads for the dead
4803908 then jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments 3 and let us arise and go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went 4 and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem
4803909 and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron
4803910 in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moon 19 the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers 20 the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings 22 the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins 23 the glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the veils
4803911 honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
4803912 children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord
4803913 the women of zion are haughty walking along with out stretched necks flirting with their eyes tripping along with mincing steps with ornaments jingling on their ankles 17 therefore the lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of zion the lord will make their scalps bald
4803914 these six things doth the lord hate yea seven are an abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations feet that be swift in running to mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren
4803915 why do ye not understand my speech even because ye cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth why do ye not believe me he that is of god heareth gods words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god
4803916 god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good
4803917 recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men
4803918 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love
4803919 lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him
4803920 but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies these are the things which defile a man
4803921 but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience
4803922 i just was so busy i meant to call but did not get around to it
4803923 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death

4803929 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable

4804004 last year during the parade i was on the street corner and there were people from bellevue and renton who came just to see j p
4804005 got all excited when he heard j p was making an appearance he came all the way from montana to see j p
4804006 they just break their butts to be so accommodating coal miner days is one of my favorite events and one of my wife joans favorite events
4804007 it really is a mystery to me how many people come up to me
4804008 i had a woman in her 50s come up to me at the jefferson county fair she said i paid 6 to get in and say hello to you as soon as i say hello im leaving then she started crying and went on with all kinds of feelings toward me
4804009 i get a lot of e mails from people ill call kids who are no longer kids but were kids who grew up in dysfunctional families where there was some kind of problem
4804010 they say you were my mom and dad or you were my father i watched you in the morning and when i came home from school you were my friend
4804011 i was just entertaining never thought about kids going through agonizing times
4804012 dad didnt have a job we barely made ends meet my brother and i used to go down by the tracks and pick up coal and sometimes fruit we lived in a cold water flat over a bar the rent was 12 a month
4804013 i was 4 the audience couldnt see me so i peeked my head around the sun and got a big laugh
4804014 i did my role on the show and the producer said that was very good
4804015 no announcement of the change was made the switchboard was flooded with calls take that guy off hes not jp patches i was disheartened
4804016 i steeled myself i didnt cry but it was hard
4804017 one funny one i remember was a guy who was on vacation in hawaii and got caught in an undertow and broke his back
4804018 i went in there with a foreign accent and pretended i was a new doctor he didnt get it a first

4804028 i think going back is part of the overall journey of working through it
4804029 the first trip will be difficult but it will get easier
4804030 their ability to talk about the tragedy relate to the media and continue to get their lives back on track and support one another is huge
4804031 it would be very nice but weve made it very clear there were other heroes who showed themselves that night
4804032 i suspect the undeserved image of the school is what ultimately led to the dramatic drop in the school roll
4804033 no gangs of 13 year old thugs terrorised the science block you couldnt get whiskey with your salad roll at the school canteen
4804034 not one knife fight ever erupted during our sustained silent reading class
4804035 when i was there i think a lot of mastertonians expected makoura to be rough because of the part of town its in
4804036 for those of us who actually were enrolled at the school this idea was laughable
4804037 this is a very emotional subject for current and ex pupils
4804038 for those of us moved by the news of the possible closure its easy to let our affection for makoura overtake the more serious issue of education
4804039 if makoura closes it will be a great loss for the wairarapa
4804040 hes a very important person at the moment im sure it made a lot of people listen
4804041 i am keen to see the ministry working closely with the commissioner to charter a brighter future for the school
4804042 its such a waste of life especially that young and thats why its been a personal thing to make sure her loss of life has the impact on others to make sure it doesnt repeat elsewhere
4804043 thats really what the main focus is with regards to the foundation so her life can help others thats ultimately what its trying to achieve
4804044 maybe she would think im a bit crazy doing it at this time of year but id hope that shed be proud and im sure she would be
4804045 we want to be in a position to be able to put education officers into schools
4804046 that last little stretch is pretty piognant in the whole thing and so weve got some activity planned when we get there
4804047 ive been putting miles in on the treadmill most days i range between walking on the treadmill two to three hours and then one decent six hour stint i go about 6km h
4804048 the key part of it is making sure that i recover well after each day ive got a specific team with me as well to make sure everything is ok with my body
4804049 having played cricket all my life and been on the cricket field for days on end and spending mindless hours in dressing rooms and what not it prepares you pretty well
4804050 were doing it for a great cause so its not too hard to get the motivation to keep you going
4804051 over the three year period we can see there is some success with what where doing and getting the message out there
4804052 there has been a downturn statistically with regards to fatalities and incident rates at level crossings
4804053 how many fatalities are acceptable i suppose its the question youve got to ask and the answer is zero
4804054 thats the acceptable number so until we reach that theres always work to be done we wont settle until we get to zero
4804055 a large part of my day is spent visiting criminals in their homes popping in on them out of the blue so they know the pressure is on
4804056 its important we target who the key criminals are and let them know we are here waiting for them and that we will get them
4804057 i love the proactive nature of the job rather than being a full time response officer
4804058 i am there as a back up but a majority of my work is within the community
4804059 dozens of cases things like closing down tinny houses and burglaries have been solved because of information known within the community
4804060 i am a firm beliver that we can keep the community safe with their help its got to be a team effort
4804061 with tinny houses for example well knock over a place and then well get reports two or three days later that theyre operating again
4804062 there is an element of frustration there but we just keep knocking them over and keep the pressure on
4804063 when i was at school people might have been smoking cannabis at 13 or 14 but now theres 10 year olds out there smoking it
4804064 theyre being given drugs by their parents and by their aunties and uncles
4804065 i mean what chance do these kids have a large part of what i do is sit the kids down and let them know its all about choice and the decisions they make now will affect them for the rest of their lives
4804066 one of our units went to the door of a property the other day and a three year old girl came to the door and said mummy what are the pig sh ts doing here thats the sort of thing we have to deal with
4804067 a lot of it is thinking outside of the square and working with outside agencies to ensure the needs of families are met
4804068 every days different you never know whether youre going to have to strap on a gun see a grizzly death or just be stuck in the office behind the computer
4804069 most of the people who live and work in wainuiomata are good hardworking folk its a great place and the people are passionate about their community
4804070 a big focus for me is being open and approachable
4804071 its vital people have confidence in police and that they can chat with me about something that is worrying them
4804072 after being chucked into a crazy situation playing a serial killer being recognised with a nomination at such prestigious awards is the icing on the cake
4804073 the nomination is enough but at the end of the day if i took it out of course id be thrilled i am a real fan of the others work so i wont be practising my acceptance speech yet
4804074 it was a great storyline to be a part of it was fun to work with johnny but the crew are the people who should be really recognised at the end of the day
4804075 the shooting crew in the studio and on location were the hardest workers out of all of us
4804076 the fact michael galvin has been recognised finally for all his hard work and fantastic performances over the years is far more important than my nomination in saying that my mum is stoked
4804077 obviously im very delighted but i am wondering what i did this year that i didnt do the other 12
4804078 i love antony starr and erik thompson i think theyre both brilliant actors
4804079 ive known eric since university which is longer ago than either of us would want to admit im honoured to be in their company
4804080 i just felt the time had come to tell the story of my lifetime achievements and mishaps
4804081 i didnt mind the negativity i felt it was all part of the story and hopefully it is something young singers and performers can learn from
4804082 i also wanted to do it for my two sons so they can see it and relate to what their daddy is all about
4804083 he wrote that song and i didnt ask for that
4804084 this song came on and a lot of other stuff came in the door for example id be riding my bike to the local dairy and the little kids would come out and throw stones at me
4804085 its only in recent years and ive come to appreciate that its quite a lovely thing to have a song named after you and its also a beautiful song
4804086 i think i have two years left to have a child naturally if i want to
4804087 liam now has a first class ice hockey coach so hes happy
4804088 i do love new zealand its very nice you have great ice cream too
4804089 i dont think i could have done any more as a wife and a mother in the circumstances and i was pretty gutted how the law is
4804090 i dragged the children out in all weathers to visit him three times a week i was at home every single night to receive telephone calls from him for four years
4804091 my daughter has supported paul all through his trial and subsequent confinement
4804092 paul decided he no longer wanted to be with my daughter who was devastated
4804093 she had spent so much time learning all she could about pauls mental health and how to deal with it
4804094 she had been so certain they would live back together again
4804095 if she had divorced paul as the family wanted her to do when this tragedy first occurred she and the children would have had half of the house and been able to get on with their life
4804096 ive got your two kids and im looking after them lets split the property and move on
4804097 you wanted this split in the first instance and now i need to find somewhere to house the children and if i can get a roof over the childrens heads so we are independent then surely that is far better for our kids
4804098 the appeal has been argued on the perceived injustice of mrs ellis continued commitment to the marriage through what must have been a very traumatic period of support for mr ellis when he was compulsorily detained under the mental health act the distress of the criminal proceedings in respect of the death of his father and then lending support to the programmes run by the mason clinic for the rehabilitation of his mental health
4804099 the metal is losing its social value and more dependent on the foreign exchange
4804100 the current fall in prices of precious metals despite the ongoing festival season is a matter of concern for the bullion and is raising fears that it may see some more downfall

4804107 i know im gonna be walking around waiting for some guy to come up to me and say are you the girl i saw in naughty neighbors
4804108 that would be so cool i mean i love having guys check me out in the mall and stuff when im out with my friends or my boyfriend but to know that some stranger guy whos talking to me has seen my spread pussy and probably jacked off over my photos would be so awesome
4804109 bailee is built for modelling she is tall and long limbed and has an amazing face she definitely stands out
4804110 we are behind her 110 percent and are very confident she will be a success
4804111 but its something people kept telling me to do from when i was young because of my height

4804115 plus youre outside all day so all you want to do is relax and get warm
4804116 principals are talking about five year olds coming in with behavioural problems and a lack of concentration and it is becoming more prevalent some of the behaviour and violent tendencies are quite alarming
4804117 some of the five year olds coming in are very low functioning
4804118 their parents have used p and they have low levels of language theyre talking like two year olds
4804119 i think its going to get worse as we have to manage these children from p families unless theres adequate support offered from the government in the form of social workers in every school or a counsellor
4804120 what that does to the foetus is stimulate receptors and neurons not usually used until after they are born and that encourages nerve cells to commit suicide knocking off brain cells
4804121 after babies are born theyre much harder babies to live with
4804122 if you get that and the mother going on p its a pretty spectacularly bad combination shaken baby neglected baby
4804123 we knew a while back there was a senior honcho who thought i was
4804124 i sure wasnt going to humiliate or be gratuitously vicious to a contestant for the sake of entertainment

4804126 palmerston north to me is one of the most exciting places to be
4804127 this is a huge opportunity for new zealand to recognise the manawatu as probably the centre of that human nutrition food research and we want to consolidate that
4804128 its probably a merger that should have happened some time ago
4804129 to make the science go faster to expand what we do
4804130 i cant really even begin to speculate on that just at the moment
4804131 heroes of chemistry strives for greater recognition of scientists like these who like chemistry itself often wear a cloak of invisibility so far as public awareness is concerned
4804132 their dedication and scientific contributions save lives and make life healthier and happier for billions of people around the world
4804133 currently lipitor is the largest selling pharmaceutical in the history of mankind with annual sales of over 13 billion worldwide

4804153 another problem with validaterequest set to true is that it is a rather broad and stupid protection erring on the side of catching too much rather than letting something dangerous slide by

4804155 we dont know at this time whether or not we will win of course it would be fantastic to be associated with ups

4804160 he says our politicians seems to forget where they come from anwar the answer no no no the
4804161 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4804162 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4804163 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4804164 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4804165 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4804166 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4804167 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4804168 i was expecting he would go for a world record time but it is a real honor to be swimming with michael phelps
4804169 it was great that all eyes were on me and looking at the guy who could beat michael phelps its a pity we didnt both finish at 50 58 i would have loved to share that gold
4804170 beforehand coach bob bowman said it would be good for me if i lost
4804171 wen he said that i was fired up i said im going to go for it
4804172 i came wanting to win as many races as i could getting as many personal bests i could
4804173 i have seven out of seven so far i dont know what to say
4804174 it is very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4804175 it is very clear that one was stroking and one was gliding
4804176 its great to win a medal i cant take it off im not angry
4804177 it was just a great race to be a part of just a spectacle
4804178 i came here to prove that im the best in the world and i did that
4804179 as soon as i saw i had covered the field and knew i would win i was very happy and started to celebrate
4804180 the injury was a setback to my training but thats no excuse because my hamstring feels fine
4804181 i just wanted to get on the podium and i knew that is what it would take
4804182 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull the match out
4804183 its a huge moment for our country and im sure all the fans in russia will be happy about it
4804184 he came and talked to us last night and watched the tapes of the previous games
4804185 he said he was ready to come back he needed time to take care of his personal business and we respected that but we managed to take care of business on the court while he was gone anyway hes a great guy and its good to have him back
4804186 i dont think we expected today to turn out as it did
4804187 you always dream of it but we cant expect it we were the underdogs going into our matches and a lot of the other teams didnt expect us to be as strong as we were
4804188 it was a bad fight but its the olympics there is no such thing as a bad day at the olympics
4804189 ive been in a worse situation before when we were losing 13 7 in the world championships in 2001 and we ended up winning 15 13
4804190 today they were serving well but then when we won our first point in the third set i felt an energy shift and then we were back in the game
4804191 you dont know how its going to turn out all you can control is going out there and playing good baseball
4804192 the same thing happened against korea we were behind against cuba and came back but we had to have this one the guys showed a lot of character coming back
4804193 i feel sad but actually its ok for us im so happy we made a record for the u s team
4804194 we could have won if we would have taken more chances
4804195 i was just thinking hang in there hang in there the whole way and just go harder
4804196 as a collective unit i think this was the best 70 minutes
4804197 it always feels better when youre on the winning side of things
4804198 we just had a training run where we drilled penalty corners
4804199 when xie xingfang fought back in the third game i thought it might be too hard to win
4804200 after the previous four matches in the competition i have been very exhausted and today i felt tired
4804201 when i missed the low house shot it only made me more determined
4804202 i was fourth in the qualification with a score of 580
4804203 i was sure that i had a chance to win with this score though it is not my personal best 583 is
4804204 its my focus to try again at age 51 its a very good feeling to get medals
4804205 i think i can speak for all the athletes that we all shot pretty bad
4804206 i was fourth in the qualification with a score of 580
4804207 i was sure that i had a chance to win with this score though it is not my personal best 583 is
4804208 its my focus to try again at age 51 its a very good feeling to get medals
4804209 i think i can speak for all the athletes that we all shot pretty bad
4804210 i believe i will break more world record in the coming years
4804211 they have proven to be one of the best teams here
4804212 and to be able to control this game and win by two goals shows our teams capabilities
4804213 i know we have more to come but its nice to be the first one i was a little nervous and heavy on my feet but i just kept wrestling
4804214 your team looked really good theyve been playing how long
4804215 theres alot of players in your program that i like
4804216 ill take any player on your 2009 team right now

4804219 commissioned from private israeli security firms several hundred military advisers estimated at up to 1 000 to train the georgian armed forces in commando air sea armored and artillery combat tactics
4804220 they also have been giving instruction on military intelligence and security for the central regime tbilisi also purchased weapons intelligence and electronic warfare systems from israel these advisers were undoubtedly deeply involved in the georgian armys preparations to conquer the south ossetian capital friday
4804221 moscow has repeatedly demanded that jerusalem halt its military assistance to georgia finally threatening a crisis in bilateral relations israel responded by saying that the only assistance rendered to tbilisi was defensive
4804222 jerusalem has a strong interest in having caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azerbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

4804237 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4804238 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4804239 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4804240 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4804241 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4804242 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

4804295 he said if john is too good for my money ill give it to presumptive democratic nominee barack obama
4804296 barack cant endorse this kind of adult content its sort of like a third rail
4804297 i would imagine if its tough for one its tough for the other
4804298 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
4804299 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
4804300 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
4804301 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling
4804302 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
4804303 in the center of the galaxy these stellar strands crowd together and you just see a smooth mix of stars
4804304 but as you look further away you can start to pick out individual strands as well as features more akin to pasta shells that come from dwarfs that were on more elongated orbits
4804305 because the stream from one dwarf galaxy can wrap around the galaxy and pass through streams of stars ripped from other dwarf galaxies
4804306 part of what we see toward virgo is a tidal arm of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy whose main body lies on the opposite side of the milky way but we dont know the origin of the other structures there really arent enough pasta varieties to describe all the structures we find
4804307 the sdss has taught us a huge amount about the milky way and its neighbors
4804308 but were still just beginning to map the galaxy in a comprehensive way and theres a trove of discoveries out there for the next generation of surveys including the two new milky way surveys that will be carried out in sdss iii

4804320 i am still not sure about crossing the line i had to look up to see the result the race on wednesday took a lot out of me

4804322 then someone said new zealand youve won and i kinda didnt believe it
4804323 we just wanted to give it a good race and we had a brilliant one so its really cool
4804324 the past two weekends unknown persons have thrown what appears to be a molotov cocktail against the wall of mission hill elementary school
4804325 we had our guys watching for hot spots until noon today and we had investigators on scene to determine the cause of the fire so far from evidence weve gathered the fire looks suspicious
4804326 the officers spotted the suspect on the street and just prior to arresting him on the outstanding warrant observed him making a drug sale to another person
4804327 i urge anyone who reads their blogs to question everything they write especially kowalski who has a history of blogging anything he wants without facts or substantiation other than rumor and his feelings make sure you read carefully for proof and evidence if theyre going to attack and smear someone theyd better have the goods they need to back up anything they say when they write about this in the future or risk a complete loss of credibility
4804328 theres not enough food for a humpback whale in the baltic sea

4804338 you have a style of writing i just cant do
4804339 its a factor for all of these athletes you have to execute under pressure the punter we have its going to be a guy we trust thats going to be the key after these five preseason games jim and i will sit down and its got to be a guy he can trust
4804340 is he into the game is he talking to himself when you look into his eyes does he have that hollow i call it the fish look with the mouth agape and the eyes staring i havent seen that in either one of these punters
4804341 ive got a lot to work on obviously but for my first game in the nfl somebody asked me how id grade myself and i said b b minus i think i did some good things
4804342 we had recovered about 40 vehicles from eight persons working with car theft gangs and on the basis of information received from them had sent a team to madhya pradesh who are there
4804343 we are proud of the millions of volunteers and more than two million donors to the obama campaign who will provide the backbone of our campaign to put america back on track and reject the old politics and failed bush policies which is all john mccain is offering
4804344 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4804345 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4804346 we would have liked to move ahead with the project
4804347 but we saw that the preparations are not yet sufficient and we instructed our energy ministries to carry out a more detailed work
4804348 undoubtedly turkey has allies undoubtedly turkey differs with iran on many issues but we would regret it if some would think that we do things because someone tells us to do so
4804349 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4804350 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4804351 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives
4804352 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4804353 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4804354 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4804355 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4804356 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4804357 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
4804358 frantic campaign has targeted many charities and service organizations by storming closing and confiscating the belongings of these organizations
4804359 without any legal justification just under the claim that they were closeto hamas in many cases the campaign targeted private businesses under a shameless accusation that the owners receive money from hamas
4804360 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us
4804361 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down for another night out there so we got prepared to stick through another tough night
4804362 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm
4804363 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking oh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried
4804364 and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break
4804365 it was amazing yesterday morning to again hear the sound of a helicopter we heard it fly over the back of the ridge
4804366 as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again
4804367 we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up
4804368 finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility when it did finally see us everyone was just jumping up and down cheering
4804369 they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm
4804370 gue pengen roger seenggaknya kasih pelukan buat dia bukannya menjauh
4804371 we hope our republican colleagues will join in a bipartisan effort not only to increase domestic supply but also to help consumers and to protect the environment

4804380 these things definitely wont make the same kind of pretty pictures on the sky that previous stream discoveries did
4804381 the notion is that you probably build a galaxy up from the inside out
4804382 actually a signature thats much longer lived than looking at stars that are bunched together on the sky which only works with very recent accretion events
4804383 probably more different than one would expect if you looked at the same feature from different places on the sky
4804384 but that isnt conclusive proof of uniqueness by any means

4804390 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4804391 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4804392 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4804393 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4804394 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4804395 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4804396 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4804397 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4804398 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4804399 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4804400 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4804401 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4804402 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4804403 nobody knows why i made them not even me this work just comes to me naturally

4804437 how do you feel yelling at people on a street is going to help further gods kingdom
4804438 people need to hear the word of god and change their ways
4804439 i agree but these people only think you and your god are fools how can that be good
4804440 these people arent rejecting us theyre rejecting god plus the more people scoff at us the more god will bless us for being fools in the sight of the world
4804441 christ said blessed are those who are persecuted in my name
4804442 so by yelling at people and having them think you are fools you set yourself apart from the world prove your love to christ and receive greater blessings in your life as a result
4804443 christ said we must reject the world and publicly proclaim the worlds need for salvation people cant deal with that because their hearts are sinful if we truly love god then we must be willing to be called fools for his names sake
4804444 is your love for christ so shallow that youre not willing to do that

4804511 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4804512 when i did chop the last stroke i really thought that cost me the race
4804513 but it happened to be the direct opposite if i wouldve glided i wouldve ended up being way too long i ended up making the right decision
4804514 se rest calidad democr tica a la administraci n auton mica y se produjo un da o sin precedentes en la gesti n de los recursos forestales

4804521 assuming that the dolphin is the ultimate swimmer and the thing that we found was that michael phelps is able to use his body in a way that seems to be very very different from the other athletes and also seems to be much closer to the dolphin than any other swimmer

4804535 all things happen for a reason may it be good may it be bad we still need to go on with our lives

4804548 we hebben vooral de kwaliteit in de gaten gehouden niet zozeer de kwantiteit

4804551 a commodity is any good service or process that can be produced by any number of firms and the only distinguishing feature between these firms is who can do it cheapest having your product or service turned into a commodity is no fun because it means your profit margins will become razor thin you will have dozens of competitors and all you can do is every day make that product or service cheaper and sell more of it than the next guy or die
4804552 when it is resolved i mean the underlying conflict it must be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of georgia
4804553 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4804554 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4804555 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4804556 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4804557 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4804558 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done but i would just note there are already consequences there have been universal concern within the eu the united states about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4804559 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4804560 we couldnt start celebrating until we knew we were all in that was a long few minutes
4804561 because were still living with it every day were working his creative contribution as we stand here today there are animators who are animating
4804562 we were so proud of the work that he has done and the contribution that hes made and one of the things is that hes never actually going to ever see what an amazing gift he gave to us
4804563 we understand the food situation in gori has now become desperate
4804564 were proud to honor gary tiger balletto one of new englands most exciting fighters ever
4804565 gary was a true warrior who could hit with the best of them few fighters in the past 20 years were as charismatic as tiger who was a true throwback fighter that always left it all in the ring and he was as tough as they come too nobody stopped him in 36 pro fights

4804568 it is something his family will need to consider but it strikes me that the greatest way to honour gottlieb would be to have a mountain named after him
4804569 we love the area and we liked gottlieb very much he was someone with tremendous intellectual ability who loved the outdoors being out with the elements
4804570 he then went to go into the guides area of the hut and doubled up in front of me he never said anything i said are you all right gottlieb but he didnt answer me he fell over in the snow in front of me
4804571 i called out to the two others come out come out gottliebs collapsed and from then on it was into a full on emergency
4804572 we had to get him inside and then made a decision to phone for help he was still breathing when he collapsed i spoke to gottliebs wife at 3 45pm within about six minutes of his collapse and said we urgently needed help
4804573 but the helicopters couldnt get in and we realised we were on our own
4804574 all in all we were very lucky that people knew the basics
4804575 i was saying things like keep his arms straight for the cpr
4804576 i wanted to assure his wife that he wouldnt have known anything
4804577 you always felt in very safe hands with gottlieb he would push you but you trusted his judgement and at breakfast and lunch you would talk
4804578 it was a very cold day but a sunny one a great day to be in the mountains its one of those things that turns to tragedy
4804579 all we can think of is that once the truth is out there and all the facts are on the table justice will have to prevail if its the truth and if we are given a fair go which we deserve to have it will be fine
4804580 from what we understand in regard to the police investigation ex girlfriends and friends have all been contacted and potentially they are investigating other things which is just ludicrous
4804581 these are the people who are supposed to be protecting us and dare i say they might have a hidden agenda
4804582 the detective said i bet he hasnt got a smile on his face like that any more
4804583 i wanted to vomit it made me feel as if there was unprofessionalism and bias

4804596 yo ya estaba preparada porque los bryan cuando termin su partido ya me lo hab an avisado me dijeron que el ambiente estaba calentito pero los espa oles aunque eran menos tambi n se han dejado notar y nos han ayudado eso ha sido una ilusi n muy grande porque participas en los juegos por tu pa s y es agradable ver como vibran contigo
4804597 no me conformo con la plata que en atenas fue amarga y llor mucho tras perder el oro no quiero vivir lo mismo
4804598 hemos logrado la mitad del objetivo nos falta la otra mitad la final el oro pero ya esto es un reconocimiento al trabajo que ya empez con la conquista de roland garros
4804599 las williams son unas adversarias peligrosas ya perdimos en wimbledon con ellas y despu s le dije a anabel medina que a lo mejor eso nos serv a de experiencia para los juegos vamos a ver tienen un servicio muy potente sobre todo son dos jugadoras de individuales pero con un gran potencial juntas espero que la derrota de wimbledon se cambie por el oro
4804600 me he puesto a hacer tonter as para dejar de estar nerviosa y al ganar grit a mi madre hay que ir a por todas a por el oro porque el paso que hemos dado es el m s dif cil ha sido muy duro y hemos trabajado mucho
4804601 creo que ha sido el partido m s complicado ambientalmente al entrar fue impactante la pista estaba llena pero ya nos lo advirtieron

4804605 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us it was pretty risky
4804606 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down so we got prepared to stick through another tough night out there
4804607 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm everything was soaking wet
4804608 it was pretty scary i was trying to lead the way the other day and a big slab fell down beside me i was really shitting myself then because its a long way to the bottom
4804609 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking ohhh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break its been like this for days and days
4804610 every time the chopper goes away and looks somewhere else youre thinking come on come on just see us
4804611 we were fine we could have lasted a few more days without too much trouble except for the boredom
4804612 we heard it fly over the back of the ridge as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility it was such a relief to see it waving back to us
4804613 there were times it was kind of scary i have to say but somehow i knew we were going to be all right
4804614 they did the right thing they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm
4804615 ok theres a slut mole bitch slag face whore named johnelle since she sucked up to all the teachers she got voted head girl of our school theres so much we could tell you about her we dont like her we never will
4804616 i was sitting in my room on the phone to my friend
4804617 later that day my best friend called me up and said um johnelle theres something i need to tell you and its on bebo she said blah blah and blah blah johnelles not giving out names have made a hate page about you
4804618 mum came to me and said whats wrong youre not yourself i just blurted it all out and i started crying and i told her
4804619 the message is getting out to some people but definitely not getting out to everyone we need all the help that we can get
4804620 i used to love hearing the rain on the roof at night
4804621 i always felt comforted by it safe and protected all i can think about when i hear it now is that my son was out alone in the rain and desperate enough to want to die
4804622 just randoms they have no reason to say anything to me yet they do what can you say i really dont know i just leave them they can say what they want
4804623 yes well i had to build up a lot of confidence to say it to everyone but i realized that there is no use keeping it a secret any longer please do not mock me about this as i am still very fragile thank you for being so understanding
4804624 we ask them would you trade a mobile phone for a blowjob

4804628 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
4804629 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
4804630 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
4804631 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
4804632 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
4804633 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
4804634 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
4804635 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful
4804636 we will try and set a new trial date as soon as possible
4804637 i dont know why they didnt decide the right thing today but it aint over yet
4804638 but its all in the lords hands so there may be some reason for it
4804639 i am sorry they couldnt come back with a verdict
4804640 i hope we have a settlement we are open to that

4804654 more troubling over the long term was that the eu saw its task as being mediator its favourite role in the world between georgia and russia rather than an advocate for the victim of aggression
4804655 mauro mina frente a cotton tiene la pelea m s dif cil de su carrera

4804670 were visualizing something that is really elegant not just a wide path
4804671 we tried to put in some lamps sculptures along the way and maybe some nice marble curbs this is something that a european capital would not be ashamed of
4804672 we would have one continuous pedestrian friendly access to every part of not only the existing downtown area but also what is likely to become high density residential on the other side of the railroad tracks
4804673 but we really want to encourage other people in the community to say we have other ideas too
4804674 college athletics particularly in the pac 10 is incredibly competitive great facilities are necessary to stay in the game we cant let the uw gain an unfair advantage by pilfering millions of our state tax dollars to build an even grander monument to athletic ineptitude on lake washington the state has better things to do with our money
4804675 sound transit is going to build the husky stadium station in about a year and hundreds of trucks will be going in and out of there each day our hope is to get in there get the renovation done and get out of there thats the sense of urgency
4804676 prolonging the tax burden to people of king county residences visitors and businesses is counter productive to what washington is doing to stimulate the economy in these economic times
4804677 out of the 300 million for the renovation we intend to raise a good chunk of that through private funding
4804678 over the past 10 years we have raised millions of dollars for various sports faciliticies and we plan to go back and raise 150 million more
4804679 not only is the price too high but major portions of the renovation club seats skyboxes loges suites and fancy private concessionaires restaurant facilities are for husky elite and are not even arguably
4804680 unlike our friends on montlake were doing the job the hard way the right way the coug way with hard earned private dollars raised from coug alums and friends

4804683 it was a horrible thing that nobody wants to go through and nobody deserves to go through but if you look beyond that you see that something is working for you when everything falls into place and you can wake up months later and have your daughters that is special
4804684 im not into the victim role i am going to live the way i want to live
4804685 i can imagine other people are thinking how do people get through that and now we know how which is the strength that you already had that you didnt know you had are what come to the forefront
4804686 it is still carmen i mean something incredible has happened to her to all of us but mainly to her and yet she is still the same woman

4804709 tactically we didnt do a lot right we made simple mistakes
4804710 the all blacks kicked well tactically when they were ahead and kept us in our half where we made those simple mistakes
4804711 were a team in transition weve seen with the super 14 teams that it takes more than a year and a half to get a team to where you want them to be
4804712 were progressing well what happened in the past was that the players would go to ground easily im trying to change that but when it gets tough they go back to what they know maybe theres a fear factor where the players are afraid to make mistakes well get better the more our confidence in the gameplan grows
4804713 i know my guys ability and know that they wont slip on the same banana peel twice

4804715 the boys showed lots of courage and togetherness while their fitness won us the game in the last 20 minutes the defence was excellent the south africans were in a number of positive positions but we showed skill guts and great positional sense to see them off
4804716 richie mccaw was outstanding rodney sooialo was superb as usual while i thought jerome kaino had his best test of his short career but the guys up front laid the platform and ensured the loosies were running forward to those breakdowns
4804717 it was a helluva physical match and defence always sets the attitude for the match the first 20 minutes was superb and we kept going from there we pulled off a number of gang tackles which makes it easier for turnovers
4804718 it tends to go your way when the momentum is going with you it favours the guys going forward and dictates the way the ref sees it it probably went both ways at times
4804719 can be affordable and is technologically feasible the french are proving that on a daily basis the question is why cant oui

4804732 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4804733 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4804734 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4804735 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4804736 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4804744 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
4804745 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
4804746 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4804747 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4804748 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4804749 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4804750 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4804751 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4804752 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4804753 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4804754 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4804755 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
4804756 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
4804757 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
4804758 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
4804759 before we tolerated everything they did to us at the plant we worked very hard but we lived free
4804760 now we have no work we are not free and we have no idea what will happen to us
4804761 with rising energy costs its great to offer homeowners a solution that can actually save them money the ability to see your projected bill before it arrives encourages the conservation of energy and puts the homeowner back in control
4804762 at the beginning i was really nervous because its a huge animal
4804763 he was right underneath us and i thought holy cow how are we going to kill it
4804764 we were very close to the animal actually we were touching it with the canoe when we struck at the beginning
4804765 theyre so proud of the hunters and for the community
4804766 we identified that there was a sufficient number of whales to allow three hunts in nunavut and nunavik
4804767 it was a very rapid hunt so it is very unlikely that the animal actually suffered
4804768 i still feel it im about to cry myself its not just for our community its for all of nunavik
4804769 a lot of people are amazed by seeing that animal

4804777 d eregulation privatization and withdrawal of the state from many areas of social provision
4804778 neoliberalism is in the first instance a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights free markets and free trade
4804779 t he drive towards market freedoms and the commodification of everything can all too easily run amok and produce social incoherence the destruction of forms of social solidarity and even as thatcher suggested of the very idea of society itself leaves a gaping hole in the social order it then becomes particularly difficult to combat anomie and control the resultant anti social behaviors such as criminality pornography or the virtual enslavement of others the reduction of freedom to freedom of enterprise unleashes all those negative freedoms that polanyi saw as inextricably tied in with the positive freedoms
4804780 juridical and actual freedom can be made wider and more general that ever before regulation and control can achieve freedom not only for the few but for all
4804781 neoliberalization require s both politically and economically the construction of a neoliberal market based populist culture of differentiated consumerism and individual libertarianism
4804782 independent trade unions or other social movements which acquired considerable power under embedded liberalism have to be disciplined if not destroyed and this in the name of the sacrosanct individual liberty of the isolated labourer
4804783 individual success or failure are interpreted in terms of entrepreneurial virtues or personal failings such as not investing significantly enough in ones own human capital through education rather than being attributed to any systemic property such as the class exclusions usually attributed to capitalism

4804788 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4804789 this thing michael did is probably going to spur a lot more life into me
4804790 i was going to be trite and say to him and ask him this question what was the most difficult race and when did you know you had a chance to win seven gold medals
4804791 i dont have to it was tonight and it was epic

4804824 ryan has been bothered by this condition in his foot for some time
4804825 he consulted with a number of specialists in an effort to correct the problem without surgery but it was ultimately determined that surgery was the best path to take for his general well being and for his career
4804826 obviously he will miss the start of the 2008 09 season but the doctors tell us he will be able to play pain free when he returns to the lineup this season
4804827 ryan got a lot of ice time for us so this will create an opportunity for another player or players to step up and fill the void until he returns

4804831 i dont think your proposal allows any practical flexibility to deal with real life crises
4804832 one reason california still has no state budget is a closed door dispute over a tax proposal that could be a multimillion dollar boon to banks that engage in subprime lending
4804833 the proposal according to legislative sources and industry lobbyists involved in the private budget talks was brought to the table by the schwarzenegger administration at the urging of lenders and other corporate interests

4804873 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4804874 its getting worse the number of properties that have been foreclosed on by the banks and still havent sold is the highest weve ever seen
4804875 in many areas with large concentrations of foreclosure sales homes are being purchased below replacement cost values
4804876 the biggest home sales gains over the previous quarter have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops
4804877 buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices
4804878 the areas of the country that saw prices go through the roof and then fall into the basement wont be the first ones to see an upturn its more likely to come in a place like cleveland or other midwestern cities that largely missed the boom

4804903 here is some info but according to what we have heard from several sources this is much more than just an emotional relationship according to staff and former staff members they claim that todd is a pathological liar the board privately has said that todd has been lying to them all along we are praying for those around todd to demand for him to get the help he needs before thrusting him back into ministry like they did 2 5 years ago when he had an affair with a different staff member we are praying for todd his family along with others that have been impacted through this

4804908 in the center of the galaxy these stellar strands crowd together and you just see a smooth mix of stars
4804909 but as you look further away you can start to pick out individual strands as well as features more akin to pasta shells that come from dwarfs that were on more elongated orbits
4804910 because the stream from one dwarf galaxy can wrap around the milky way and pass through streams of stars ripped from other dwarf galaxies

4804915 war der frau etwa zu warm oder wurden ihr die klamotten gestohlen oder suchte sie einfach nur den ultimativen kick bild de bleibt dran
4804916 when i chopped the last stroke i thought it cost me the race but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try and get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4804917 it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4804918 losing by one hundredth of a second is the most difficult thing to accept especially in an olympic final
4804919 if its up to me i would drop the protest
4804920 im shocked but im really happy there is a gold medal at stake but i came into this expecting bronze and i did one better and got silver and almost the gold
4804921 this is what the results showed on the electronic board
4804922 there was no need to look over to try and see him i saw his shadow coming in my goggles

4804925 i looked at the video footage from omega and it was very clear the serbian swimmer had second behind michael phelps one was stroking phelps the other gliding
4804926 according to our rules we use an automatic system and in this case the omega system was in perfect order and perfect condition for this race
4804927 after seeing the video i met with the serbian officials and team leaders and offered them the chance to see the race for themselves after the competition
4804928 the serbian team were satisfied and agreed and they had the chance to look at the video to be sure the decision is correct
4804929 all i can say is that i raced as hard as i could and swam my best the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first

4804934 i am pretty upset it probably wont set in till i get back to the athletes village
4804935 i may be in need of more races but that is no excuse perhaps i could have done more training and performed in more races
4804936 i just tried to keep my rhythm my hamstring feels good it is just one of those things
4804937 at the same time i gave my best and everyone knows i did i just ran out of time
4804938 i pushed all the way to the finishing line but my mechanics werent what i wanted them to be i couldnt get them where i wanted them to be

4804940 pervez musharraf has proven himself to be one of the biggest enemies of islam if the not the biggest
4804941 is the pakistan army an army defending muslims or merely a security service agency or a band of mercenaries which kills muslims to please its masters the neo crusaders in the white house
4804942 it is evident that during the past years the pakistan armys primary duty has been to take part in the killing of muslims from kabul to islamabad
4804943 exposed the ugly anti islamic face of the military leadership of pakistan
4804944 i stayed no more than six years in pakistan mostly in peshawar
4804945 all of us have enjoyed the warm welcome and the caring attention of most pakistanis which has been most evident during the past crusade being carried out by pervez and his hunting dogs in compliance with orders of their master in washington

4805042 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected

4805051 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4805136 how anyone bounces back from a big setback or disappointment depends on their level of resilience

4805142 mom sees shes upset and says lets go to the mall lets go shopping youll feel better shes hoping to cut short the moments of upset and disappointment the moments of adversity
4805143 its planting the seeds of someone who uses things to feel good
4805144 acknowledge the feelings say i see how upset you are tell me about it and then leave it be
4805145 allow the daughter to sit with the sadness and the disappointment whether it takes 15 minutes or two hours and discover that the feelings will go away and she will in fact survive those feelings just fine maybe shell take out a book or write in her diary or call a friend which are all healthy mechanisms she can learn to rely on

4805172 you may say that many countries dont play football but that makes it more easier then
4805173 for a long time people were saying use debit instead of credit
4805174 there are very defined rules about how defective merchandise would get handled and you have rights you dont have with pin
4805175 if theyve had other transactions where theres been fraud in the past we will take that into consideration
4805176 if a thief steals your pin they can go to an atm
4805177 you have to make sure you have enough money to pay it back
4805178 this protects the banks from losses on no sufficient funds or nsf checks as well as the accounting gyrations that would be required to reverse entries in the payees account
4805179 as you can see the process can easily take more than two weeks and even if the check doesnt clear within the 15 day hold period which occurs all too often provisional credit is given to your account
4805180 as a consequence of this banks in guam are exempt from the hold period provisions of the federal banking regulation
4805181 now imagine how long it takes to get good funds from a foreign bank
4805182 we did not add anything more than what is existing out there but we modified it to be compliant with the ada
4805183 it wasnt prudent for us to resurface and then come break it so we left that part alone
4805184 no 1 is do we have enough right of way to do so
4805185 its something we definitely are looking at because we are required by law to do so
4805186 for phase ii as well as all future road projects we will be looking into addressing the public law that mandates pedestrian walkways and bicycle lanes
4805187 kids want to be accepted to belong and to be like peers they admire as a result peer pressure can influence the choices young people make contributing to poor decisions or reinforcing good ones so a lot depends on whats important to the kids your child spends time with
4805188 as a parent you can shape the way your child deals with negative peer pressure
4805189 kids benefit from frequent discussions about many topics including use of tobacco alcohol and illegal drugs driving sex respect for property and cheating in school explain to your child that if he feels uneasy about doing something especially just because other kids are doing it stop
4805190 change is the essence of life be willing to surrender what you are for what you could become
4805191 a poor man is one who has to ask permission to live what he enjoys
4805192 what they might think i am crazy no better not say hello
4805193 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
4805194 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
4805195 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot
4805196 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
4805197 and really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
4805198 i know a few women who have come out here to do hairdressing but they left to go back to the coast because the pay was bad and theres not much to do
4805199 i think if they improved wages for those types of jobs it might help
4805200 theres definitely a lack of beautiful women blokes are not as picky you take what you can get
4805201 there are a small number of professionals like school teachers and nurses but its more of an open set up its difficult to find a girlfriend in this town and keep her

4805211 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4805212 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4805213 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4805214 this family has spent 200 000 to send you to college and now youre telling me you cant read
4805215 he said oh my lord i dont have no brakes i just closed my eyes

4805230 intensif ies our isolation exaggerate s our propensity to objectify each other and persuade s us to objectify ourselves by encouraging us to believe that our purpose is to look good and have lots of sex
4805231 unlike selling yourself in the meat markets of bars and clubs manhunt requires you to create a sexy image that stands separate from your physical self

4805267 our data shows that the law should require both the safer sequential firing system and training

4805270 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4805271 there have been complications in the pregnancy so she has been with us for some time so we could ensure everything would be all right
4805272 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4805273 at some point there will be a change and they will have that opportunity
4805274 i have mine too which is to move this department forward
4805275 theres so much to be done i have a lot of energy i havent given that a thought

4805278 i have spoken with him and the player is in perfect shape
4805279 he is training normally is here to play and therefore he is going to play
4805280 i can only assess what robinho does here and with us everything is normal i have to say that i havent seen any change in his attitude
4805281 youre at 70 per cent time to take it up to 100 per cent
4805282 wave your inflatable penis in time with the kick drum
4805283 the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market
4805284 after the enslaving subordination of individuals under division of labor and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor has vanished
4805285 each individual the opportunity to develop and exercise all his faculties physical and mental in all directions
4805286 the division of labour among people to educate and school people give them all round development and an all round training so that they are able to do everything
4805287 will possess scientists and artists of all kinds in countless numbers
4805288 a new type of man will arise a superman an exalted man
4805289 our dehumanized factories our unsatisfied senses our estrangement from nature
4805290 man sought open spaces the possibility of moving about of not constantly colliding with other people
4805291 for them the man of the past who developed his powers harmoniously is the ideal an ideal which alas no longer inspires our degenerate age
4805292 fearing that they may disclose the size of their accounts to members of their families they therefore prefer to keep their savings under the fireplace or buried in the ground
4805293 a small community where all neighbors watch and where all are neighbors
4805294 believes that the civilization into which he was born and which he makes use of is as spontaneous and self producing as nature
4805295 the mass does not wish to share life with those who are not of it it has a deadly hatred of all that is not itself
4805296 free and equal phrase in the declaration of independence was an unfortunate paraphrase of a better statement contained in the virginia bill of rights all men are by nature equally free and independent in other words men can be equally freeuniform
4805297 the widening of the range of alternatives open to people as consumers and as producers
4805298 the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market
4805299 a short weekend on a farm might have convinced marx that the cattle themselves might have some objection to being reared in this casual manner in the evening
4805300 a lack of teachers and of technical training has hampered industrial development and production in recent years
4805301 workers appear often to have been not tempered but softened by their exposure to a more sedentary life as many students rather than finding life on the farm rewarding fled china or killed themselves
4805302 personal interest is the moving force of our social development the objectivity of the category of personal interest lies in the fact that yugoslavia socialism cannot subject the personal happiness of man to any ulterior goals or higher aims for the highest aims of socialism is the personal happiness of man
4805303 the degeneration of the yugoslav economy owned by the whole people
4805304 to crush beneath it any creative minority which disturbs it disturbs it in any order of things in politics in industry
4805305 ya must as well go further airport then hop on the plane with me i wld luv that
4805306 no trabajamos porque nos gusta trabajamos porque no tenemos otra forma de conseguir dinero
4805307 we are not responsible for the jargon the companies are
4805308 i wouldnt mind having the militia here with all the crime weve been having lately
4805309 seeing the angels walk by it really provides a vision of empowerment for the community
4805310 i worry though that they may have chased the bad guys out tonight but once the angels are gone theyll come back
4805311 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
4805312 i dont have good finishes at those race tracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
4805313 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
4805314 it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4805315 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
4805316 it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
4805317 the first thing i need to know is how much fuel do we need to save
4805318 you cant tell the driver to save fuel with five laps to go in the race the information has to be fed to a driver as soon as that run starts
4805319 look were on the edge here the only way to save fuel is to go slower you de accelerate sooner youre off the throttle sooner youre on the throttle later and youre on the throttle less aggressively
4805320 by the way you still have to make reasonable lap times in most cases
4805321 were just trying to get better and we did definitely improve on road courses
4805322 but these bigger tracks we still are it seems like always about two or three laps less than what everyone else is im not a fan of the fuel mileage races i like the fastest car winning i dont think the fans like a crew chief race i think they like to see a drivers race
4805323 it depends on what side of the fence you are on man
4805324 if you are on the winning side you are happy dont matter how
4805325 were going to put notes on windshields and identify those cars that are parked in no parking areas with plans to hopefully have tickets and towing if it continues to be a problem
4805326 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4805327 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4805328 made some admissions to us which confused the whole issue
4805329 they prosecute murders all the time and they dont have a statement from the murder victim
4805330 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4805331 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4805332 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia is controlling the central asian republics
4805333 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4805334 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4805335 when my president calls me on this mobile and orders me to start the withdrawal i will carry out his order
4805336 our understanding is that the agreement has been signed and russian troops are starting to withdraw
4805337 but there are a lot of units scattered around this area my understanding is that the process will take some time
4805338 he may be president but he still comes home and swipes my socks
4805339 i have always had a dread of becoming a passenger in life
4805340 the biggby way is a way of looking at customers as people and that kind of engagement we have at our stores makes it a personal experience people love our coffee but the reason they come to our stores is it makes them feel good
4805341 employers are not prepared for an influx of older workers with flexible work schedules so many boomers will need to pursue opportunities for self employment that can produce reliable income without a lot of investment or risk
4805342 boomers should gain a sense of relief when they tap resources like the bbrc that are aggressively helping them define new income opportunities
4805343 theyve exhausted all the tips that came in and are hoping the reward will prompt some more information
4805344 the biggest thing that we have going for us is we have some pretty clear pictures
4805345 and anybody who knows these guys i think its going to be pretty obvious who these people are
4805346 nu mi a fost fric de nimic dar juc torii s au speriat de rezultat am nceput foarte bine jocul dar apoi parc nici nu mai vroiau s in mingea nu mai suntem acea echip ar goas care am fost iar eu le am atras aten ia de acest lucru dup meciul cu dinamo rezultatul e cel real arat ce s a nt mplat n teren

4805348 were now relying on the collective wisdom of this leadership
4805349 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation we will do all we can to help
4805350 finally to make fully clear to robert mugabe that a new government in zimbabwe that must reflect the will of the zimbabwean population is necessary

4805356 in the last 11 months they have made a 180 degree turnaround
4805357 they are now conducting unilateral operations at the battalion level throughout their area of operations with little or no coalition support
4805358 we operate as a battalion staff trainers and combat advisors
4805359 they had a lot of challenges due to the fairly young iraqi logistical system
4805360 they are now more proactive confident determined and willing to take the fight to the enemy
4805361 their presence has allowed the people to feel more secure and has opened doors for more cooperation between the population and the ia in general
4805362 they see you there sweating operating eating and training with them and they will be more open to listen and learn from you but most importantly they will want to show you that they can do it and are as capable as you are

4805365 our international platforms have provided us with financial flexibility that we believe is important as we continue to navigate the market conditions in the u s
4805366 we are looking at various capital initiatives which leads us back to the partial or complete sale of assets or looking at various reinsurance structures and other matters we havent gone to the capital markets and we have indicated that could be a combination of types of securities but actually looking from an equity capital raise that is not a primary source of capital raise at this point in time or that we anticipate that at this point in time he said

4805427 it was just a great race to be a part of just a spectacle
4805428 i came here to prove that im the best in the world and i did that
4805429 as soon as i saw i had covered the field and knew i would win i was very happy and started to celebrate
4805430 the injury was a setback to my training but thats no excuse because my hamstring feels fine
4805431 i just wanted to get on the podium and i knew that is what it would take
4805432 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull the match out
4805433 its a huge moment for our country and im sure all the fans in russia will be happy about it
4805434 he came and talked to us last night and watched the tapes of the previous games
4805435 he said he was ready to come back he needed time to take care of his personal business and we respected that but we managed to take care of business on the court while he was gone anyway hes a great guy and its good to have him back
4805436 i dont think we expected today to turn out as it did
4805437 you always dream of it but we cant expect it we were the underdogs going into our matches and a lot of the other teams didnt expect us to be as strong as we were
4805438 it was a bad fight but its the olympics there is no such thing as a bad day at the olympics
4805439 ive been in a worse situation before when we were losing 13 7 in the world championships in 2001 and we ended up winning 15 13
4805440 today they were serving well but then when we won our first point in the third set i felt an energy shift and then we were back in the game
4805441 you dont know how its going to turn out all you can control is going out there and playing good baseball
4805442 the same thing happened against korea we were behind against cuba and came back but we had to have this one the guys showed a lot of character coming back
4805443 i feel sad but actually its ok for us im so happy we made a record for the u s team
4805444 we could have won if we would have taken more chances
4805445 i was just thinking hang in there hang in there the whole way and just go harder
4805446 as a collective unit i think this was the best 70 minutes
4805447 it always feels better when youre on the winning side of things
4805448 we just had a training run where we drilled penalty corners
4805449 when xie xingfang fought back in the third game i thought it might be too hard to win
4805450 after the previous four matches in the competition i have been very exhausted and today i felt tired
4805451 when i missed the low house shot it only made me more determined
4805452 i was fourth in the qualification with a score of 580
4805453 i was sure that i had a chance to win with this score though it is not my personal best 583 is
4805454 its my focus to try again at age 51 its a very good feeling to get medals
4805455 i think i can speak for all the athletes that we all shot pretty bad
4805456 i was fourth in the qualification with a score of 580
4805457 i was sure that i had a chance to win with this score though it is not my personal best 583 is
4805458 its my focus to try again at age 51 its a very good feeling to get medals
4805459 i think i can speak for all the athletes that we all shot pretty bad
4805460 i believe i will break more world record in the coming years
4805461 they have proven to be one of the best teams here
4805462 and to be able to control this game and win by two goals shows our teams capabilities
4805463 i know we have more to come but its nice to be the first one i was a little nervous and heavy on my feet but i just kept wrestling

4805510 i dont have any money but i want to play the game so i will pirate it
4805511 saying that something is normal isnt endorsing it in an ideal world i guess everyone would describe 100 of what they are selling point out all the bad reviews as well as the good ones and explain all the flaws it has to everyone about to buy it but i cant imagine that working out very well
4805512 why is it fair to pirate a game that is obsolete
4805513 will you buy all the games that youve downloaded that are re released in the future
4805514 why should i feel bad about pirating something i would never buy

4805519 now russia needs to honour that agreement and withdraw its forces and of course military operations
4805520 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4805521 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4805522 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states fully recognises this reality
4805523 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4805524 about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4805525 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4805526 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honouring their word
4805527 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4805528 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4805529 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4805530 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west

4805584 wal mart rejects the suggestion that they are telling associates how to vote but as i point out in my book one of the biggest employee free speech concerns is the chill that employer pressure to conform can place on worker free expression
4805585 whether or not this turns out to amount to a technical violation of federal election commission rules it is sophistry to suggest that this kind of message from an employer doesnt have a chilling effect on the political and expressive rights of these employees its possible that they could find themselves disadvantaged if they express political views that happen to differ from those of a powerful corporate employer
4805586 the timing of the announcement by fda raises eyebrows considering the california legislature is about to vote on a measure to remove the toxic chemical from some childrens products bpa has been linked to altered brain development behavioral changes and prostate problems in animals and should not be used in any consumer products that could potentially leach into food and liquids especially in products young children use every single day
4805587 we have long since lost faith in fdas ability to be an impartial authority on bpas safety time and again fda has sided with special interests instead of the public interest on this chemical
4805588 it appears that congress has lost considerable faith in fda on this matter too

4805640 its a different era from the cold war its globalization people are more open and chinese mindsets have changed too
4805641 the war for gold medals is raging at the beijing olympics and the americans are losing
4805642 this olympic games has seen the most world records broken and has the highest television audience turning it into a leader of happy good times
4805643 i think well be leaving here very much with a smile on our faces
4805644 was soll ich sagen schei e gespielt schei e verloren schei e
4805645 i told yall we would win a nc and we dang did it
4805646 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4805647 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4805648 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4805649 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4805650 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4805651 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4805652 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4805653 strongly supports access to comprehensive and age appropriate sex education
4805654 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4805655 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4805656 certainly theyre going to have to get their things in order
4805657 right now its looking more threatening for the sarasota area
4805658 our thoughts are that this system will probably be somewhere on the north coast of cuba probably the straits of florida on monday and at that point it could intensify into a hurricane and ramp up pretty quickly
4805659 and is expected to remain below 10 knots for the remainder of fays life
4805660 all the people who are in jobs to help black folk are white
4805661 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4805662 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4805663 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4805664 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4805665 aaaabi you look good hich deyishmemishsin walla billa except the hair
4805666 some people may say bad things about me even my own village is against me
4805667 it was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout by doing what he did
4805668 the day they took the marabout to prison it hurt me so much it was as if they had come to jail me
4805669 its my marabout that did this to me it forged me it allowed me to learn that i can overcome difficulty
4805670 i knew that he would be hit but i didnt think he would be hit up to this point
4805671 ask yourself what is this money used for the kids are not fed so its not for food they wear rags so its not for clothes they dont have mattresses so its not for their beds
4805672 this is a sham on a grand scale under the cover of religion
4805673 the parents of these children believe in these men so completely that when they hand over their sons they relinquish all control
4805674 they swear allegiance to the marabout and say that whatever happens to their son is for the childs good
4805675 my grandson can say whatever he wants but i know the truth
4805676 he was hit because he was lazy and refused to memorize his verses
4805677 now russia needs to honor that agreement and withdraw its forces and of course military operations
4805678 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4805679 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4805680 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states fully recognizes this reality
4805681 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done but i would just note there are already consequences
4805682 there have been universal concern within the eu european union the united states about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4805683 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4805684 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4805685 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4805686 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4805687 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4805688 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4805689 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4805690 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4805691 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4805692 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record

4805697 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
4805698 the korean police at the time were notorious for fabricating evidence that didnt exist
4805699 it was truly an emotional moment for me to hear him say it
4805700 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
4805701 came to her begging her to save her my mother
4805702 a very gentle kind of soul honest in his own way a very anticommunist and conservative christian
4805703 i just needed to be with someone who was in the courtroom with her
4805704 we werent sure how it was gonna turn out in the east
4805705 but it turns out the community is much more excited than they ever were before we dont have a lot in the east and i think people feel like one of their own is back
4805706 the spices belong over the stove not in some rotating shelf beside the sink i think the lids should be in this area and the pots and pans over there
4805707 the walls were pink not blue the crib white not this ugly brown strawberry shortcake decorated the wall border not the stupid baseball basket ball football and hockey stick border with that stupid mobile hanging from the crib to match

4805720 its not really a huge surprise for me because we are just building on the success we had at the end of last season and in our warm up matches for this season against galatasaray and blackburn rovers
4805721 obviously as a newly promoted side anything more than just staying up this season would be good but we are honestly not thinking beyond our next match against borussia moenchengladbach
4805722 we played very competently with two quick goals and some good positioning
4805723 the second half was less spectacular but we are in good shape physically our organisation was not 100 percent but i am happy with the three points
4805724 of course were annoyed especially after leading twice and still not winning
4805725 we fell asleep and when you do that you end up with this kind of result
4805726 i have never heard of what youre talking about i will put my hand on a bible
4805727 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence

4805729 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff

4805740 to beat them i think upstairs is where these guys have needed to improve the most over the last couple of years theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing they honestly can win this thing its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4805741 serbia really shut him down and he came out with something to prove today he came out with a little fire in his eyes and did a great job for us found those holes and was able to put the ball away
4805742 we came into this tournament and knew we had the capabilities of beating everyone
4805743 this really showed that that game against serbia was a fluke and were a gold medal contention team
4805744 us and serbia are a bit better than the u s a
4805745 they probably will be the third team in our group
4805746 aaaabi you look good hich deyishmemishsin walla billa except the hair
4805747 nffc has always been very skeptical of the environmental public health animal welfare and ethical impacts concerning rbgh fda never did proper testing regarding human health concerns when they first approved rbgh the european union and japan have never approved its use rbgh has always been about helping monsantos profits and not farmers
4805748 monsanto saw the writing on the wall consumers are rightfully queasy about injecting growth hormones into cows and the possible public health effects on both the animals and on humans if we dont like roger clemens using hormones why should we allow our cows to be treated with such rubbish most farmers long ago rejected monsantos rbgh since only about 15 of dairy cows are injected with it
4805749 many dairy farmers suffering from depressed prices for many years felt pressured by monsanto and land grant universities into believing we needed to be more and more efficient and adopt technology if we were to survive as a dairy farmer of over 40 years what i know we need most of all is a fair price for our milk and to get rid of the corruption in our industry if dairy farmers had been paid fairly all along many would never have turned to rbst in the first place every week dairy farmers are going out of business for the basic reason they cant meet their costs of production not because they arent using rbst

4805852 the market is focusing on cyclical peak earnings but miners are heading for a problem when returns normalise
4805853 the investment time horizon of hedge funds and traders is microscopic compared to pension funds and the markets are now very momentum driven in moments of panic and crisis no one is using valuation to pick stocks they just churn their portfolios to try and keep up to date they dont want to be underperforming the market at the end of the quarter
4805854 whenever you have a bubble there is always an argument that this time it is different
4805855 people are pointing to the impact of china but the increase in the oil price is not completely accounted for by that to pretend the demand for resources is in no way influenced by the global economic cycle is crazy if oil goes to 200 a barrel then the average us driver has to spend 10 to 20 percent of their income on petrol so you have to ask if everyone in china owns a car how will they afford to drive it around high commodity prices in themselves slow global growth
4805856 you also have to keep in mind that a lot of chinas growth has been financed by us debt
4805857 the banks have only written down their lending impacted by the us so far not their uk lending losses

4805896 the stuff thats left behind now is being used its a residual that before was simply wasted
4805897 we recognized there was an opportunity in using them for biofuel so we developed a biofibre policy whereby we would be able to look at that from a fuel perspective
4805898 it is an arena that has a lot of potential but its not a silver bullet and right now its being painted as a sort of bullet to the forestry industry and for climate change as well
4805899 whereas it has potential in both of those camps to some extent looking at it as a silver bullet as opposed to just one of the dimensions of the overall tool kit is very dangerous
4805900 we dont see that the government has taken any of our comments seriously at all and are not looking at it through the lens of long term forest health
4805901 if it is necessary to provide baseline subsidies to biofibre projects is this a promising sign for an effective new forestry paradigm
4805902 no all four rounds he didnt do what we were telling him
4805903 third round i came out firing i was thinking that maybe id be up by two points but they said it was tied up
4805904 in that last round i went in there with my hands up i know i hit him with a straight left he caught me with the hook ill give them that but i think i caught him with two more punches and should have won the fight 8 7
4805905 we wanted him to box but the main thing we wanted him to do was get up early get ahead first we knew he had faster hands and more power so we wanted him to engage and make the guy have to come to him
4805906 instead they started playing the waiting game from the beginning we yelled at him talked to him between rounds but he basically did the opposite of what we asked him to do
4805907 one of the things we know is that these kids have been calling home so often
4805908 what happens is they get instructions all the way from the united states you can tell the difference because once the bell rings they start doing what their other coaches tell them
4805909 they were trying to tell me to just go at him go at him
4805910 im not that type of fighter to go out there and throw punches if i do that im going to get caught with shots i want to go out there and play it smart
4805911 luis was actually a very aggressive boxer until tonight one of the things thats always helped luis is his aggression but for some reason tonight he decided to stand back and wait and it cost him

4805913 yes i was born in russia but since for so many years ive lived in the u s i feel i represent the united states of america
4805914 i feel like im more of an american than a russian but im very proud of my heritage and proud of being a russian
4805915 i go back at least once a year and visit my grandparents and my family and friends
4805916 it makes it so special to me i always feel a little more russian when im there
4805917 it is a pity that nastya sic is now an american
4805918 i definitely feel that i went out there today and represented both countries
4805919 i am competing for the u s but with my name being nastia i hope i made my family and fans proud in russia as well as in the united states

4805947 at last i am obviously thrilled with this result despite the mistake i made i was angry with myself for that lapse of concentration which saw me spin off at the same time as beno t lison but that anger spurred me on to produce a charge towards the end which was rewarded with a footing on the final podium

4805995 i cant explain it the advantage for the freestyle is probably now for anky
4805996 im disappointed by my stupid mistakes but i have a real good freestyle and i dont give up until the end
4805997 i was planning to get out of the blocks and win this race but unfortunately he did it
4805998 i know i have much more to do but im proud to be on that podium for america
4805999 i came on strong unfortunately by then there were a few people in front of me
4806000 when im in the blocks i go into tunnel vision
4806001 so i really cant say exactly how i felt until i got across the line and i looked at the clock and i saw he ran a world record
4806002 one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport
4806003 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4806004 theres nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been
4806005 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4806006 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4806007 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4806008 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4806009 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done
4806010 i knew michael is a back half swimmer and that he would be chasing me down at the end
4806011 i saw his shadow on the side of my goggle and i knew he was coming i liked to be chased the last eight meters i just put my head down and i did not breathe
4806012 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4806013 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4806014 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4806015 i am sure bob bowman his coach and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4806016 people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race
4806017 if we got to do this again i would win it
4806018 its not really a huge surprise for me because we are just building on the success we had at the end of last season and in our warm up matches for this season against galatasaray and blackburn rovers
4806019 obviously as a newly promoted side anything more than just staying up this season would be good but we are honestly not thinking beyond our next match against borussia moenchengladbach
4806020 we played very competently with two quick goals and some good positioning
4806021 the second half was less spectacular but we are in good shape physically our organisation was not 100 percent but i am happy with the three points
4806022 of course were annoyed especially after leading twice and still not winning
4806023 we fell asleep and when you do that you end up with this kind of result
4806024 i cant explain it the advantage for the freestyle is probably now for anky
4806025 im disappointed by my stupid mistakes but i have a real good freestyle and i dont give up until the end
4806026 unfortunately halfway through the session this afternoon when it started to rain a little heavier the track became very very difficult
4806027 there were a few patches there that were catching a lot of riders out i went in to turn one twice and lost the front and had to pick it up luckily there werent really any off track excursions
4806028 i was running out of energy yesterday very quickly this morning i woke up and feel completely different now my head cold feels worse but in general my fitness and my energy feel a lot better
4806029 fortunately we were able to get a good lap in before the standing water had come in
4806030 then we basically sat out the rest of the session because my knee has been sore im still hoping for a dry race tomorrow
4806031 everybody is very important in my team but you need players who can make the difference and today moussa dembele made the difference
4806032 its not even fun to talk about the referees any more

4806082 it is sad that president bush would use a speech to the knesset on the 6oth anniversary of israels independence to launch a false political attack it is time to turn the page on eight years of policies that have strengthened iran and failed to secure america or our ally israel instead of tough talk and no action we need to do what kennedy nixon and reagan did and use all elements of american power including tough principled and direct diplomacy to pressure countries like iran and syria george bush knows that i have never supported engagement with terrorists and the presidents extraordinary politicization of foreign policy and the politics of fear do nothing to secure the american people or our stalwart ally israel

4806109 sometimes the best decisions are not always exactly the way the doctor sees it
4806110 i dont consider him crazy at all i think if hes happy and content with playing it out this way thats the most important thing
4806111 ive been trying to play in my head what i would do in his situation
4806112 i dont know if i would have taken the same route he has to be honest cancer is not something you want to mess around with
4806113 ill remember that day for the rest of my life talk about a life changing experience thats as big a one as you can have i think youre changed for the rest of your life
4806114 a lot of people kept asking me after that race what was going on
4806115 that kind of made it a little bittersweet it went well i made the team then i had to go back and deal with reality
4806116 eric is handling this situation with courage and poise and his decisions to compete at the olympics and to share his story for the benefit of others are evidence of that courage
4806117 while we are hopeful that he will be able to compete erics heath remains the absolute top priority
4806118 lances agent told my coaches that im the closest thing to lance armstrong that there is on the planet right now
4806119 if i can have a fraction of the impact that hes had just a tiny little bit then i think what im going through will be good
4806120 the olympic games should be fun im not worried about swimming fast there
4806121 i know what im risking but its basically just a longer recovery time after the olympics ill have nothing but time thats why it wasnt too hard to make this decision
4806122 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces
4806123 georgia is a member of the united nations and south ossetia and abkhazia lie within its internationally recognized borders
4806124 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4806125 this is addressed to the juniors you who come to us in such numbers usually on temporary appointment until the next civil service examination which you must take and pass before you can begin to be promoted
4806126 we hope you do like it and find it interesting and congenial if you do not you are wasting your time here and we are wasting ours in trying to teach you even the simple duties of the positions to which you are assigned you are just beginning at the bottom of what really is a very fascinating and somewhat complicated kind of work and your part of it for the time being is quite apt to appear both simple and mechanical but you are a part of a big machine which works smoothly only when all of its parts work smoothly together if your part goes wrong the whole machine may go wrong if for example in charging books you copy a borrowers card number incorrectly say by writing a 6 where an 8 ought to be you are charging a book to an entirely different person from the one to whom you gave it at the desk and if it would become overdue our notices would be mailed to an innocent party who would have a right to feel offended and to hold a very low opinion of the public library your acts or your conduct in general may thus become a direct cause for making or marring the reputation of the library as a public institution
4806127 dance with me lets move across this canvas and paint a picture that will truly speak a thousand words and evoke feelings of bliss unconditional love and total joy
4806128 i have been in this void and nothing seems to be changing
4806129 communication snags seems to be a huge thing in our relationship
4806130 how can i use the energy of the lunar eclipses on aug 16th to help myself and life
4806131 if you had just bought what was going up the most and sold what was going down the most that gap is wider than at any point since 1927 this has been a very challenging and severe period for value managers with five and sometimes 10 year track records being threatened
4806132 but it seems to me that it has to fail as you can only increase commodity prices so much before demand destruction occurs
4806133 farmers can only pay so much for fertiliser and when gasoline went over 4 a gallon in the us there was a meaningful decline in gasoline consumption so the notion that the commodity bubble which is largely price driven can continue doesnt make much sense
4806134 amongst that large group of stocks some will prove the diamonds in the rough that have been thrown out unnecessarily by investors
4806135 the super boom in profitability is way above trend so the earnings cycle isnt yet set up for deep value to outperform
4806136 that means the scarcity plays will get hit and you can already see that with the cyclicals because they are going down were trying to be disciplined cyclicals can suck you in on a low p e thats a value trap in a stock thats down because profits are peaking but value managers are also inherently sceptical of structural changes in profitability and may not be willing to pay up when profits have improved
4806137 we are still concerned that earnings wont be supportive of many of the out of favour stocks we want more visible and durable earnings
4806138 the it sector has very depressed profitability and expectations and it has been trashed but it is focused on free cash flow and share buy backs compare that to the massive capital spending in metals and mining
4806139 this is under new management and is essentially an oligopoly but it has been ripped down to record low levels of valuation there are some short term threats to elective procedures like this and laser eye surgery but we dont think its quite that discretionary
4806140 value investors are naturally attracted to financial institutions but you have to be quite careful the incidence of financial firms failing is probably higher than that of industrials as small problems on the asset quality side can become big problems for banks with fairly thin capital
4806141 the other problem with investing in financial companies is that there is nothing to look at its a leap of faith in management that they have soundly underwritten their loan portfolio when credit cycles go bad its always surprising how far institutions like countrywide for example have gone into the very shaky credits they didnt need to they had by far the leading market share and yet they strayed into those areas
4806142 so we own about a dozen bank stocks and if eight of them prosper two of them do okay and two of them go to zero our portfolio will be okay
4806143 established to promote civil discourse and the common good of all
4806144 il ritardo dellapplicazione della legge quadro sugli incendi boschivi una delle cause principali degli incendi che ogni estate colpiscono il nostro paese per contribuire a porre fine a questa ciclica emergenza occorre fermare a monte la possibilit di speculare sul fuoco e fondamentale proseguire nella realizzazione del catasto delle aree percorse dal fuoco uno strumento indispensabile nella lotta agli incendi che i sindaci devono mettere in pratica con decisione affinch siano imposti i vincoli di legge ai terreni colpiti dalle fiamme solo cos si potr fermare il business che alimenta gli incendi boschivi
4806145 i cittadini hanno un ruolo determinante per fermare i roghi conclude il presidente di legambiente segnalare i focolai sul nascere e rompere quel muro di omert che troppo spesso circonda gli incendiari fornendo indicazioni utili alle indagini che le forze dellordine svolgono sono elementi fondamentali per arginare un business spesso alimentato dalla criminalit organizzata
4806146 and if you walk to the end of the block there sits a starbucks and directly across the street in the exact same building as that starbucks there is another starbucks there is a starbucks across the street from a starbucks and ladies and gentlemen that is the end of the universe
4806147 just recently weve seen an enormous surge in investor appetite for gcc trades especially around the saudi currency
4806148 this has always been a story that people are watching and many still have this sort of revaluation priced into their macro trade
4806149 so every time you have a statement like this the market regains that appetite but we believe traders need to temper their reaction right now
4806150 but it wont rise for a while so it takes the pressure off the pegged currencies to deal with a moving target
4806151 in hong kong everyone now understands that if asia has a recession asset prices collapse in hong kong because they have to take the slowdown effects through wages and asset prices domestically rather than through the currency and interest rates
4806152 i dont think the middle east is familiar with that picture although in the gulf the business cycle can be smoothed for the general population via subsidies
4806153 in dubai there is now a lot of non arab money and they are exposed to the same economic forces so i dont know how theyre going to cope with a major recession in the middle east i think it will be a big boom and bust story
4806154 then it made a stand and defended its peg and now it is accepted as part of the furniture there so the middle east still has a lot of pain to go through before they are as stable as the hong kong peg
4806155 at the moment the political pressure to retain the dollar peg is too high so it is unlikely that they will move in the next six months
4806156 but we might see the central banks start buying euros thats what russia did when it came off the dollar peg
4806157 it uses up your capital and we prefer to play egypt as a proxy which runs a managed float
4806158 it also has the suez canal and tourism revenues so it is a much safer bet as the likelihood of appreciation is much higher
4806159 we are also seeing systemic risk increase currency weakness is already being seen in iceland vietnam and romania
4806160 then you will have the contagion trade where everyone trades those currencies that look a little bit vulnerable next it will hit the stronger emerging market currencies but they will be able to withstand the attack so contagion will roll out but it wont roll very far
4806161 this should help bring inflation down as gdp will run well below trend for at least a year it will create an output gap and this will allow rates to be cut
4806162 whereas australia has fantastic fundamentals and the minute the bank starts to cut rates they will sell that currency its a lingering perverse logic driven by the carry trade
4806163 the smog was so thick we never saw the sun
4806164 i know what i wanna be why dont you know what i wanna be
4806165 can we try it a little bit differently onstage i just like to see it
4806166 for this summer if you let me go and take a class in la you know and intern for a month ill come back and finish out my next year that way you wont have to hire anybody or whatever
4806167 i hate when people judge me and think that im some kind of racist just because i have a confederate flag
4806168 but you dont seem to care how it makes me feel so therefore i can judge you back i can judge you for having it because you dont care how it makes me feel to have to look at it it might mean one thing to you but it means another thing to me
4806169 my father was a menthor and i learned a tremendus amount about every aspect of the business from him
4806170 henri never understood the meaning of impossible and where everyone would see failure he saw an opportunity
4806171 the sky is the limit limit are put in place to be overtaken
4806172 hey guys i got tagged off the break but dont worry i wiped
4806173 these companies may also have guaranteed returns on assets or index linked tariffs and thats a significant advantage in the current environment as inflation becomes more of a concern
4806174 we want a meaningful but manageable sized fund that we can get invested quickly
4806175 in our core fund we are targeting oecd investments because we want to mitigate the regulatory legal and economic risks and oecd countries have transparency over the economy and a proven rule of law
4806176 people will increasingly have to pay to get rid of their rubbish and you can make money out of recycling the components of some household appliances
4806177 saubermacher has a refuse derived fuel strategy to take advantage of this for example when oil is over 80 a barrel its economic to make fuel by burning plastic bags
4806178 there is no point going up against the big french companies when it comes to auctions in the major cities
4806179 we will look to take a quality operational local partner and we will offer something quite different from the rest of the marketplace
4806180 there is a lot of demand for latin america due to the commodity driven boom well be focused on green field sites
4806181 either they dont have the experienced teams or they lack the deal flow so you get funds investing in shipping airlines or lotteries that might be allied to infrastructure but they dont pass the simple test of an economic downturn
4806182 water gas and waste management are stable but also subject to movements in long term interest rates
4806183 but transportation which is very cyclical performs well when rates go up adding the two together hedges the interest rate sensitivity and mitigates commodity exposure
4806184 by 2015 it could be very serious they need to reinvest but depending on the state there are different regulations and you have to be very careful at picking the right states
4806185 gas storage is the same in europe you can get long term contracts but in america they might only run for two or three years so it is less of an infrastructure play
4806186 valuations need to be looked at on a stock specific basis as expectations are sometimes too high and may not be realised investors should also scrutinise the types of contract that companies are securing
4806187 the chinese have long term plans for their railways but these stocks are relatively expensive
4806188 but surprisingly you can buy chinese highway stocks at 15x earnings which is cheaper than those in europe and they will grow at 15 20 percent earnings so on a p e to growth basis these are much cheaper than their european counterparts
4806189 but they are listed in hong kong so they have visible earnings and it is high quality infrastructure

4806200 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record

4806232 the market fell out of bed at the start of june and over a six week period we had a precipitous fall in share prices
4806233 in past bear markets it has tended to take several months for share prices to fall so far but the market reacted very quickly and has already priced in a deep economic downturn
4806234 bear markets tend to run for about 12 to 15 months so it may run another three to six months
4806235 in the mid 1990s it was about two years whereas now it is down to five or six months
4806236 in mainland europe the fall isnt as pronounced due to large bank and family stake holdings but it is still down from about 18 months to 10 months
4806237 until this bear market we never had a significant number of people who make money if a company goes bust
4806238 but the reason why the banks are trading below their rights issue price is more to do with the fact that they are in trouble and people think that there will be further fund raising
4806239 hedge funds remove muddled thinking from the market they take prices very quickly to what people think they should be
4806240 that removes the ability of markets to muddle through and muddling through can be quite useful at times
4806241 the basic problem is that central banks have spent the last 15 years trying to iron out the economic cycle and their focus has shifted from controlling inflation to steady growth
4806242 in the us whenever there was the slightest hint of a normal slowdown greenspan tended to throw money out of helicopters as fast as he could
4806243 unfortunately the banks are realising they have a problem at the same time as companies are at peak profit margins so we would expect corporate earnings to come down even if nothing else was happening
4806244 the ftse is trading at p es of 10 5x against a trough of 10 4x in 1991 whilst bank stocks are at 5 4x compared with a long term sector average of 12x
4806245 the uk banks still havent taken any write offs relating to the domestic economy although the likes of hbos have increased their provisions to cover bad debt and our view is that there is no point investing in contentious sectors as the rest of the market is so cheap
4806246 it is probably a bit risky to load up with those yet because we havent heard all the write offs and if a recession occurs then all the bad debts will start to come through
4806247 the impact of slower sales will be magnified by competitive pricing and rising input costs
4806248 a feature of a number of consumer companies is higher balance sheet debt
4806249 it seems like they got so burned by the tmt bubble that now they always assume the most negative outcome of any story affecting the sector so telecoms which should be a defensive hasnt been from a share price perspective even though the quality of the management in uk telecoms is the best by a mile
4806250 but between 1970 and 1979 small caps outperformed the ftse all share by about 200 percent our view is therefore to buy small caps because they have fallen the most
4806251 we are seeing more talks that dont go anywhere where one side is looking for a bargain and the other is looking for fair value
4806252 but if the private equity firm walked away because the companys managers are holding out for a good price then it could be worth looking at
4806253 the problem is that there is very poor breadth in the market with a concentration in resources and mining stocks only a few shares have participated in the upside and we need to see that broaden out
4806254 but over the last few months even though the oil price has been going up oil related shares havent followed it i think the reason for that is people did not believe that the oil price was sustainable at those levels
4806255 the 20 rule simply confirms what we have long suspected since the beginning of the year we are well and truly in the grip of a grizzly bear market
4806256 that is exactly what we have seen this week with financial stocks yet again leading the way the outlook for pretty much every stock though is truly dire at the moment and if it was not for the energy and mining sectors keeping us afloat we would have been testing the 5 000 level months ago
4806257 there has been a fundamental shift in institutions desire to embrace risk some profitable business lines may therefore be closed for months and perhaps years
4806258 these large drops started with overvalued equity markets which was not the case this time
4806259 in resource rich countries we are always looking at those sectors anyway because these are the drivers of growth for emerging markets and underpin natural resource exports asia eastern europe and latin america are all taking measures to enhance their infrastructure but we think there is more potential in asia as the population is so much bigger
4806260 india is more interesting for investors because you can go direct or there a large number of companies available from cement companies such as ambuja cement and acc to manufacturers of railway rolling stock such as siemens india
4806261 they also need to draw on the private sector in a way that the chinese dont
4806262 for direct investors the most important judgement is the political judgement power is one of the most politicised sectors in india so there are tariff controls as an investor this means this is only a good opportunity if you are able to manage the political risk
4806263 as a foreign investor you will be in a partnership with a state or federal entity so its critical that you think about how those interests are balanced
4806264 with the railways which is a huge monolithic industry you would also want a big local partner with clout you need to think about the leverage of the local parties
4806265 so one of the best opportunities for direct investors is to go into one of these developments
4806266 the problem is that the notion of indian infrastructure is so sexy now there is more money than projects which has pushed down the rates of return there are too few good projects
4806267 the emphasis at the moment is on getting foreign investors into sectors where the chinese lack the technical know how
4806268 they are now trying to move up the value chain because places like vietnam and bangladesh can undercut them on cheap labour
4806269 china is currently a net importer of coal because it has been quicker and easier to import coal from overseas than to bring it through the interior
4806270 this has led to a move to build power stations at the coal mines with the aim of transmitting the electricity over long distances to where it is needed what they call coal by wire but that needs a massive improvement in the electricity grid and there is no energy ministry
4806271 the question now is whether this can be applied to inland waterways as central and western china could be opened up by making the yangtze river a modern transport hub
4806272 there are 200 corporates in africa but these are under researched opportunities
4806273 some markets have had reasonably good runs like kenya and ghana and zambias index doubled last year nigeria has also had three years of relatively good growth but new funds are being set up to invest in this area every week which helps explain why the performance has been so good
4806274 the growth potential in sub saharan africa is very great so we will be doing more there as we go forward but it is going to take time
4806275 kenya has a pretty good history of capital market development but well have to live with political problems for a while in this region the good news is that it is attracting a lot more investment than it has before particularly with the chinese russians and indians moving in and whenever you have that kind of push you start to get infrastructure working
4806276 when i first went there the stock exchange was in a shopping centre
4806277 and when i first went to botswana i walked into a brokers office and said wheres the stock exchange and he said turn around youre in it i turned around and there was a list of stocks this is the kind if thing you have
4806278 banking and insurance reforms are encouraging institutional domestic investment in nigeria
4806279 the market has been led up by banks but 8 percent non oil gdp growth is helping the stock market
4806280 most of them now have at least 1 billion in capital which has made them stronger and able to take on big transactions in the oil and gas sector and the big infrastructure projects
4806281 historically these have gone to foreign investment banks but the local content requirement has helped
4806282 the banks are competing for the same corporate business so their margins are thinning out and therefore they are now starting to lend to retail customers
4806283 we are seeing mortgages car loans and credit cards creep up there are still some legal issues to be sorted out but the banks are expanding their footprints by opening more branches to get more clients onto their books
4806284 we have seen a lot of interest and flows whereas three years ago it was very difficult to get anyone to even look at it but the perception is quite different now africa is the last frontier market but people are buying the long term growth story
4806285 flows are drying up everywhere in emerging markets the environment is not too good for equities
4806286 there was a very short sharp move upwards following the investment grade rating from s amp p at the end of april and as people were looking to raise cash they decided to take advantage of this if youve been invested in latin america for a while this is definitely an area where you would have had profits to realise
4806287 we do see a weakening in bank lending and possibly some increase in non performing loans and as interest rates increase some of the real estate opportunities look less attractive
4806288 chile is lagging a bit behind the curve but it has been trying to offset the inflows of currency from the very strong copper price
4806289 both brazil and mexico have programmes to promote infrastructure investment so ports and the transportation of goods and services should improve
4806290 in the long run this should reduce inflation as this will lower the costs of production and make their goods more competitive
4806291 rising inflation is a concern and loan growth to some of the lower income groups is excessive there could be some set backs there but there is less risk of a foreign exchange crisis than in the past
4806292 it is not as exciting as some of the other mobile operators in india russia or nigeria but as the money comes into latin america this will be a beneficiary
4806293 and it is probably one of the safest most predictable earnings defensive plays as so much of mexico is dependent on what happens in the us particularly the growth of the southern states
4806294 latin america is basically brazil and a handful of other stocks
4806295 of all the regions it is the smallest and it is shrinking in many ways in contrast to emea where youve got other markets coming through i dont really think its necessary to have a latin america fund you can pick the eyes out of it and get exposure to other stocks elsewhere in the world
4806296 people think that china has completely blown itself up but if you look at it it is only down 13 percent relative to the emerging market index this year and the banking sector is up some 17 percent
4806297 in fact they have outperformed year to date one of the best iron ore producers in the world cvrd
4806298 there is no better example than the amazing houdini like disappearance of those people who last year said that when the china a share market falls which it has done massively the china story and the commodities story will be badly affected well that just hasnt happened has it but where are these people
4806299 it wouldnt make a difference if it fell 90 percent in contrast to the size of the equity markets in developed economies where it does affect your wealth the chinese still have well over a trillion dollars sitting in retail bank deposits
4806300 brazil is simply not as robust as people think not as robust as emerging market funds positioning suggests and certainly not as robust as in recent years
4806301 unlike previous oil price spikes there appear now to be few options to get out of jail free we are witnessing not simply an oil problem but rather the first stages of what could become a global energy crisis the challenge now is the dearth of inexpensive available energy sources to permit the reduction of oil demand through fuel switching
4806302 failing to take tough decisions will lead to an extended period of energy inflation
4806303 this will prevent oecd economies from stimulating growth through monetary policy while developing economies burdened with subsidies will be forced into trade controls and commodity hoarding
4806304 the real cost and impact of energy prices must be tackled or the lights really will start to go out
4806305 growth in both real gdp and energy demand in emerging markets is likely to remain strong for some time
4806306 while some countries are beginning to tighten monetary policy and some are cutting fuel subsidies these moves have been modest and are unlikely to have any significant impact until late 2009 or 2010
4806307 in the meantime strong energy demand growth in emerging markets will outstrip additions to non opec supply and will offset the declines in demand that have already occurred in the us and europe
4806308 there are 500 million poor voters who wont allow this subsidy to be cut the government doesnt dare tinker with this
4806309 in the middle east a shortage of natural gas is having a direct impact on the oil supply first because oil products are being burned instead of natural gas and secondly because reduced gas injection into oil reservoirs is curbing the production of crude oil
4806310 even the bullish and widely followed goldman sachs commodity team suggested a near term correction in the oil price
4806311 the rise in the oil price was exaggerated by the actions of hedge funds which as the true speculative buyers reversed the time spreads which had entailed their betting on the short end of the curve against the long end

4806323 i will be sad to leave behind so many friends in the house it is an intense place where we bond often while looking for lighter moments across party lines ages and ideologies but i will say that i look forward to new experiences and to joining some close friends and frequent co sponsors from both parties in the senate in the house i leave behind much work i have begun with members of three fantastic committees i will especially miss the revenue and taxation committee because i feel that the work there is so vital to ensuring fairness in the lives of idaho families my colleagues know me and know i will be hard at it continuing to work with republican and democratic senators to make positive improvements to legislation affecting the taxes paid by middle class people and small businesses all across idaho

4806331 jarenlang zijn de landbouwprijzen erg laag geweest waardoor boerengezinnen hier en vooral in de ontwikkelingslanden het moeilijk hadden het is dus niet slecht dat de prijzen toenemen maar laten we van die ruimte gebruik maken om ons vlaams belgisch en europees landbouwbeleid duurzaam te maken niet enkel op economisch ook op ecologisch en sociaal vlak een europese landbouw die de bevolking betaalbaar gezond en lekker voedsel verschaft met respect voor de producent het leefmilieu en de natuur

4806366 why did you not look into the background of this fellow did you not do your due diligence when you buy a house you check for termites when you buy a researcher do you not check for saddam
4806367 the strange thing is that the entire study depends on the data delivered by the iraqi research team there were no americans on this study in iraq none at all
4806368 will become a major resource for conflict researchers especially economists and political scientists
4806369 a think tank that we have set up in bogota specializing in the analysis of conflict and violence
4806370 saddam was in violation of the terms of cease fire of the first gulf war saddam appeared to be trying to develop wmds appeared to possess them and had already demonstrated his willingness to use them it is common knowledge that he went out of his way to make everyone think that he had these weapons bill clinton sure believed this to be true he still says so to this day saddam was supporting terrorism note the payments to families of suicide bombers in the palestinian territories
4806371 i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused
4806372 and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe many of them i think have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that on afghanistan and dont understand for them the very different kind of threat
4806373 bill clinton sure believed this to be true he still says so to this day
4806374 but forget about whether the weapons were there for a moment the inspectors definitely went to iraq they left only because the united states warned them to get out before the bombs started to fall on march 19 2003 but for some reason the president of the united states keeps saying in public and on the record that the inspectors werent there
4806375 president bushs astonishing new reason for the war with iraq saddam wouldnt let weapons inspectors in
4806376 i would hazard that believing bushs blatherings does not support ones position as a reasonable critic skeptic of death rates in iraq or agw 23
4806377 saddam was supporting terrorism note the payments to families of suicide bombers in the palestinian territories
4806378 im glad ian gould is once again setting the record straight about the middle east the real horror is the israelis bulldozing homes of suicide bombers families the suicide bombers themselves are why theyre victims victims of the evil jews and the fascist americans
4806379 in a sane world one shouldnt punish people for the crimes of their relations and one also shouldnt punish people who happen to live in the same building as the relatives of criminals

4806383 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son

4806385 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
4806386 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4806387 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few

4806399 i dont think theres any complacency whatsoever this is a new and young side and m s dhoni has done well as a captain we are aware that its going to be a tough contest and we need to play good cricket we have done well and got the momentum and we need to continue in that manner
4806400 we had a good asia cup and we have done well in tests so the confidence is there and we have to be on top of our game in whats going to be a keen contest
4806401 i felt good after the asia cup and very happy to be back in form i was not in the team and some people had faith in me and i am happy with what i did but then again everything is in the past and you need to do it all over again as a new series begins
4806402 i had one week off then started training as usual the a team was training and i was doing the routine training with prabath nissanka and mario villavarayan the trainers appointed by the board
4806403 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4806404 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4806405 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4806406 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4806407 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4806408 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4806409 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4806410 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4806411 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4806412 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4806413 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4806414 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4806415 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4806416 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4806417 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4806418 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4806419 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4806420 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4806421 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4806422 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4806423 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4806424 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4806425 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4806426 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4806427 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4806428 who are open to doing something on the production side
4806429 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4806430 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4806431 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4806432 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4806433 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4806434 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4806435 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4806436 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4806437 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4806438 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4806439 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4806440 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4806441 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4806442 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4806443 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4806444 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4806445 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4806446 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4806447 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4806448 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4806449 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4806450 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4806451 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4806452 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4806453 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4806454 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4806455 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4806456 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4806457 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4806458 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4806459 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4806460 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4806461 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4806462 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4806463 pochi minuti per lavezzi largentina vince 2 1 ai supplementari
4806464 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4806465 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4806466 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4806467 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4806468 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4806469 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4806470 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4806471 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4806472 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4806473 the list of artists and contributors who have graced the pages of arkitip now reads like a whos who of popular culture many of which received exposure in arkitip long before the mainstream took notice
4806474 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4806475 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4806476 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4806477 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4806478 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4806479 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4806480 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4806481 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4806482 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4806483 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4806484 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4806485 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4806486 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4806487 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4806488 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4806489 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4806490 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4806491 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4806492 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4806493 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4806494 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4806495 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

4806509 for weeks whispers and rumors have swirled around capitol hill with administration officials tipping reporters to personal records of republican candidates and community leaders
4806510 only swift action will bring to light how this confidential information was planned to be used for political gain an independent investigation is the only way to ensure full disclosure of the database accessed and the individuals involved
4806511 citizens should be very concerned tax payer funded thp resources may have been used for opposition research to discredit political opponents it is essential that swift action is taken to prevent this abuse of power and bring this situation to a clear conclusion prior to any potential influence on this election
4806512 to investigate as a potential criminal matter rather than internal affairs
4806513 they are going to do their investigation they are going to provide their results of that investigation to the district attorney we will find out what if anything the district attorney feels is appropriate to do once the da has made that determination internally theyll decide what an appropriate action is
4806514 having an agency conduct its own investigation of felonious activity within its own ranks is stunning and unacceptable this should be an urgent matter handled by an independent agency to reveal the identity of the individuals who had their records illegally accessed the identity of the individuals who requested these illegal background checks and the use or planned use of the information among the basic answers sought

4806522 it shouldnt be this way with the slowing economy democrats should be running away but they look weak on a military crisis inconsistent on an economic crisis and impotent on their own brewing political convention crisis but i think we will look back to this week in august as the time the party that had it all in the bag just puked in it

4806556 das ist etwas was wir schon immer tun wollten wir sind sehr sehr aufgeregt
4806557 with high wrought hopes and pleasant anticipations of a romantic and delightful journey across the plains
4806558 other than being young attractive white women moving west by wagon fanny was
4806559 the beauty of the sunset and the scenery around us filled our hearts with joy
4806560 without a sound or a word of warning the bluffs before us were covered with a party of about two hundred and fifty indians who soon uttered a wild war whoop and fired a signal volley of guns and revolvers into the air
4806561 my husband advanced to meet the chief and the savage leader immediately came toward him uttering the friendly words how
4806562 t hey requested that we should prepare supper which they said they would share with us and then go to the hills to sleep
4806563 t he indians quickly sprang into our wagons tearing off covers breaking crushing and smashing all hinderances to plunder they filled the air with the fearful war whoops and hideous shouts t wo of the most savage looking of the party rushed up into my wagon with tomahawks drawn in their right hands and with their left seized me by both hands and pulled me violently to the ground injuring my limbs very severely almost breaking them i turned to my little mary who with outstretched hands was standing in the wagon
4806564 fanny kelly found herself on a horse bound for an indian village
4806565 my plan was not successful crouching in the undergrowth i might have escaped in the darkness were it not for their cunning
4806566 nearly insane over the fate of her husband and mary desperate for want of water fanny again stood at deaths door on the third night of captivity when she accidentally broke her captors peace pipe
4806567 the sun began to sink and the chief was so enraged against me that he told me by signs that i should behold it rise no more
4806568 helpless and almost dying with terror at my situation i sank on a rocky seat in their midst
4806569 in what i almost felt to be my final breath and remembering a purse of money which was in my pocket i drew it out and divided it among them
4806570 a short time later fanny again faced death when an enraged indian tried to shoot her with an arrow finally the weary womans suffering was assuaged somewhat when she was allowed water at a campsite whereupon she quickly dropped down in sleep
4806571 i was aroused by a whistling sound and gathering myself up looked fearfully around me
4806572 terrible as captivity had been thus far once the victim reached the village bondage began in earnest fanny kelly
4806573 i had read of all the characters of romance and history wherein the nature of the red man is enshrined in poetic beauty
4806574 meanwhile uncertain of marys fate since the night she escaped fanny kelly could only pray the child had somehow reached safety
4806575 onc day as i was pursuing what seemed to me an endless journey an indian rode up beside me whom i did not remember to have seen before at his saddle hung a bright and well known little shawl and onto the other side was suspended a childs scalp of long fair hair
4806576 as myeyes restedon the frightful sight i trembled in my saddle and grasped the air for support a blood red cloud seemed to come between me and the outer world i dropped from the saddle as if dead and rolled upon the ground at the horses feet
4806577 one of the most horrifying moments of fanny kellys captivity was not a beating burning or rape
4806578 w hile the savages lingered in camp about the banks of the yellowstone river a large mackinaw or flatboat was seen coming down the river
4806579 with a vicious yell the savages set upon them dealing death and destruction in rapid strokes
4806580 the captives were lost in a trackless waste and surrounded by a mounted foe who knew every foot of ground
4806581 the day that mrs kelly was brought into the fort was one of the coldest i ever esperienced
4806582 no person can have even a faint idea of the uncontrollable emotions which swept over me
4806583 in spite of the abuse she had endured fanny tried to piece together her life

4806595 giving young children real guns to handle is inappropriate it could be glamorising the weapons and creating familiarity which is plainly wrong
4806596 the foolish display at this festival can serve only to normalise firearms or make they appear attractive even glamorous we are tragically used to seeing images of primary school aged boys handling assault rifles in liberia or mogadishu but in limehouse

4806610 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die

4806612 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned

4806614 knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him
4806615 blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years

4806702 pardon him theodotus he is a barbarian and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature
4806703 and those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music
4806704 a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice
4806705 i feel pretty good right now i should be ready
4806706 cannot play media sorry this media is not available in your territory
4806707 do i have a lot in common with this job candidate
4806708 implies a huge number when we extrapolate out to the rest of the milky way
4806709 in the center of the galaxy these stellar strands crowd together and you just see a smooth mix of stars
4806710 but as you look further away you can start to pick out individual strands as well as features more akin to pasta shells that come from dwarfs that were on more elongated orbits
4806711 because the stream from one dwarf galaxy can wrap around the milky way and pass through streams of stars ripped from other dwarf galaxies
4806712 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4806713 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
4806714 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
4806715 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4806716 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4806717 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4806718 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4806719 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4806720 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4806721 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4806722 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4806723 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4806724 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4806725 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
4806726 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
4806727 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
4806728 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4806729 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
4806730 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4806731 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4806732 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4806733 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4806734 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4806735 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4806736 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4806737 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4806738 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4806739 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4806740 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4806741 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4806742 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4806743 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4806744 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4806745 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4806746 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4806747 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4806748 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4806749 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4806750 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4806751 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4806752 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4806753 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4806754 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4806755 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4806756 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4806757 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4806758 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4806759 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4806760 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4806761 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4806762 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4806763 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4806764 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4806765 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4806766 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4806767 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4806768 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
4806769 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
4806770 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
4806771 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
4806772 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
4806773 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
4806774 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4806775 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4806776 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4806777 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4806778 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4806779 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4806780 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4806781 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4806782 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4806783 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4806784 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4806785 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4806786 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4806787 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4806788 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4806789 this is a really nice blank canvas that would be useful for the town
4806790 the response from the town was that they wanted a quiet place to recreate
4806791 i think it will be a big benefit for the town if its used wisely
4806792 im interested in those kind of apocalyptic stories and how circumstances define people
4806793 the latest documentary i edited went to the very prestigious locarno film festival in switzerland and south by southwest i have directed a couple commercials music videos and now shorts
4806794 gli avversari sono ancora troppo vicini e visto che da queste parti pu piovere in ogni momento preferisco continuare ad attaccare
4806795 a parte il fare il pelo a una balla di paglia tutto filato liscio
4806796 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4806797 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4806798 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4806799 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4806800 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4806801 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4806802 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4806803 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4806804 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4806805 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4806806 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4806807 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4806808 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4806809 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4806810 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
4806811 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
4806812 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
4806813 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
4806814 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
4806815 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
4806816 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
4806817 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
4806818 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4806819 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4806820 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4806821 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4806822 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4806823 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4806824 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4806825 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4806826 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4806827 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
4806828 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
4806829 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
4806830 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
4806831 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4806832 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4806833 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4806834 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4806835 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few
4806836 im an educator not a wind expert or an investor
4806837 the great unknown which is how much the wind company is making
4806838 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
4806839 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
4806840 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4806841 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
4806842 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
4806843 i dont know if he really wanted to go on the dl but were in a bind right now said cox who added that didnt know who would take glavines next scheduled rotation turn on tuesday against the new york mets
4806844 wives are easily acquired you will find another child bride
4806845 i just think neither of us knew what the other was proposing
4806846 we have the people here in town who can do that here for free
4806847 the money is unexpended from other places in the 2007 08 budget
4806848 i came here just to win and i did just that i didnt even know id broken the world record until i did my victory lap

4806853 wir kombinieren schon jetzt etwas besser als in der vergangenen saison das ist der stil unseres trainers und den versuchen wir immer mehr umzusetzen
4806854 theres state statutes but they dont really have any teeth to them
4806855 on our property were constantly cleaning up cans and stuff from people going up the hill and down the hill
4806856 you have to look at all aspects and see if there will be a substantial savings you would also have to sit down with the unions and create a memorandum of understanding
4806857 ive heard other people are using it and it seems to work out well in those cities i wouldnt oppose it
4806858 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
4806859 it was all pretty dramatic the girls were due up on stage in three minutes time when he ran up to them hed clearly had too much to drink
4806860 somehow he had got backstage within yards of the group luckily their security team intercepted him before he was able to do anything untoward but it took three burly guys to bring him down as he was getting really aggressive
4806861 the girls were total troupers and despite being a bit shaken they simply went out and gave a brilliant performance like nothing had happened
4806862 once they were safely onstage the decision was made to call the police
4806863 ekaterina and ronnie were all over each other they were holding hands and ronnie introduced her to everyone as his girlfriend kat its very weird to see she looks like she could be his granddaughter hes obviously very fond of her
4806864 im actually terrified when he takes me on a drive especially through the canyons in los angeles wow hes at one with his car lets just say that
4806865 i am returning to the states to work on my new single and album lewis will be focusing on racing i dont think we will have much time to see each other before christmas

4806867 we will meet with the representatives of chevron texaco who are asking for a meeting but with our colleagues of the amazon defense front the plaintiffs lawyers present
4806868 be confident that you have a patriotic and sovereign government that will never again bow to the interests of the big transnational companies
4806869 we are aware of the great challenges awaiting us over thenext four years they are tough challenges even intimidatingchallenges
4806870 fay could be near hurricane strength as it approaches central cuba on sunday
4806871 up the western portion of the florida peninsula in a few days
4806872 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy
4806873 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4806874 i didnt come here to run the world record because i was the world record holder
4806875 we continue to see softness in the market which we believe is caused by the continued weakening in the economy high gas prices and alternative choices for slot patrons in new york and rhode island
4806876 is creating new options for new and reactivated customers who have not seen us for a while
4806877 its obvious that things like gas prices and concern over the economy have been wreaking havoc with the numbers for a while
4806878 the decrease in revenues was disappointing but not terribly unexpected
4806879 and we feel somewhat comfortable that with the new mgm grand about 1 000 new hotel rooms and 800 more slot machines at foxwoods that we still were able to have higher revenue

4807002 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy
4807003 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line

4807006 with the fall in oil and other commodity prices in the past month both the markets and fed officials had started to turn away from inflation risks and focus on growth risks
4807007 the view which we agree with is that with the usual long and variable lags falling commodity prices and rising unemployment will drive down inflation no need for the fed to get its hands dirty when the housing and credit crunch will do the job
4807008 the markets are in such a forgiving mood that both the stock and bond markets rallied on thursday despite what can only be described as an ugly cpi report

4807021 we have achieved our goal which was to get both cars onto the front row starting from pole is especially important here since the first turn is very tight and it is easier to defend from in front during the early part of the race as is frequently the case in the le mans series traffic promises to be a problem we will need to tread carefully and avoid brushing the slower cars as we pass them which is what happened to me this morning the team has once again done a fantastic job and our car is very nicely balanced

4807070 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4807071 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4807072 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4807073 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4807074 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck

4807084 me sent confiado pero en el primer asalto sal a estudiar mi rival en el segundo me solt y salieron todos los golpes despu s en el tercero me aguant un poco y en el cuarto me sent muy bien f sicamente
4807085 i grew up in historic northeast minneapolis in a blue collar environment i studied my moms hands as she hung clothes and rolled dough for pierogi i watched with a fascination our next door neighbors hands as she used her ax to decapitate a hen for dinner and even as a kid i sensed that my familys welfare depended upon my dads ability to use those strong hands of his to shovel coal into the boiler of a soo line steam engine the folks in my neighborhood survived by working with their hands this probably was the beginning of my fascination with them

4807102 the republican party left me the republican party is no longer the one i joined and worked with for three decades

4807110 i really see successful third parties as correctives to failures of the major parties
4807111 when a major party fails third parties serve as safety valves which alert the major parties about their failures and give them a chance to respond
4807112 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4807113 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4807114 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who have crossed sarah

4807116 es notable que hayamos podido concentrarnos y ganar el dobles
4807117 no dorm lo suficiente me alegro realmente de haber podido sacar energ as para ganar este partido
4807118 estoy segura de que los aficionados rusos deben estar muy contentos
4807119 quiero disfrutar este momento que es muy importante para mi carrera
4807120 its tough to scrounge up floor credentials but i did get in to see kemps acceptance speech and doles convention speech
4807121 it is even more important now for people to have a professional looking resume since theres so much competition
4807122 you always think what could i have done different what could i have done better what could i have done to help more
4807123 shes one of those examples of not just talking but doing
4807124 she does a lot of things very quietly not for recognition and not for thank yous she does it because she genuinely believes in the community and sees good in everybody
4807125 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4807126 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4807127 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4807128 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4807129 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4807130 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4807131 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4807132 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4807133 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4807134 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4807135 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4807136 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4807137 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4807138 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4807139 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4807140 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4807141 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4807142 this is the sickest shit ive ever seen in my life
4807143 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4807144 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4807145 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4807146 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4807147 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4807148 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4807149 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4807150 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4807151 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4807152 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4807153 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4807154 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4807155 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4807156 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4807157 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4807158 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
4807159 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4807160 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4807161 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4807162 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4807163 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4807164 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4807165 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4807166 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4807167 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4807168 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4807169 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4807170 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4807171 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4807172 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4807173 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4807174 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4807175 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4807176 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4807177 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4807178 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4807179 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4807180 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4807181 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4807182 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4807183 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4807184 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4807185 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4807186 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4807187 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4807188 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4807189 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law
4807190 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4807191 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4807192 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4807193 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4807194 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4807195 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4807196 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4807197 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4807198 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4807199 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4807200 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4807201 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4807202 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4807203 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4807204 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4807205 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4807206 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4807207 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4807208 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4807209 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4807210 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4807211 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4807212 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4807213 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4807214 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4807215 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4807216 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4807217 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4807218 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4807219 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4807220 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4807221 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4807222 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4807223 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4807224 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4807225 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4807226 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4807227 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4807228 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4807229 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4807230 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4807231 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4807232 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4807233 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4807234 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4807235 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4807236 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4807237 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4807238 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4807239 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4807240 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4807241 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4807242 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4807243 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4807244 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4807245 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4807246 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4807247 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4807248 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4807249 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4807250 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4807251 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4807252 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4807253 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4807254 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4807255 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4807256 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4807257 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4807258 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4807259 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4807260 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4807261 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4807262 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4807263 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4807264 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4807265 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4807266 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4807267 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4807268 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4807269 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4807270 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4807271 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4807272 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4807273 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4807274 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4807275 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4807276 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4807277 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4807278 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4807279 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4807280 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4807281 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4807282 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4807283 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4807284 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4807285 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4807286 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4807287 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4807288 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4807289 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4807290 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4807291 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4807292 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4807293 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4807294 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4807295 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4807296 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4807297 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4807298 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4807299 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4807300 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4807301 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4807302 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4807303 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4807304 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4807305 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4807306 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4807307 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4807308 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4807309 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4807310 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4807311 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4807312 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4807313 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
4807314 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
4807315 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
4807316 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
4807317 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
4807318 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
4807319 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4807320 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4807321 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4807322 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4807323 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4807324 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4807325 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4807326 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4807327 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4807328 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4807329 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4807330 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4807331 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4807332 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4807333 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4807334 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4807335 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4807336 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4807337 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4807338 for it is written that a son of arabia would awaken a fearsome eagle the wrath of the eagle would be felt throughout the lands of allah and lo while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced for the wrath of the eagle cleansed the lands of allah and there was peace
4807339 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4807340 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4807341 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4807342 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4807343 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4807344 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4807345 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4807346 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4807347 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4807348 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4807349 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4807350 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4807351 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4807352 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4807353 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4807354 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4807355 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4807356 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4807357 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4807358 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4807359 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4807360 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4807361 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4807362 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4807363 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4807364 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4807365 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4807366 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4807367 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4807368 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4807369 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4807370 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4807371 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4807372 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4807373 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4807374 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4807375 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4807376 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4807377 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4807378 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4807379 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4807380 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4807381 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4807382 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4807383 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4807384 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4807385 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4807386 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4807387 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4807388 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4807389 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4807390 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4807391 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4807392 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4807393 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4807394 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4807395 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4807396 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4807397 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4807398 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4807399 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4807400 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4807401 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4807402 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

4807425 it is well settled that the right to speedy trial in all criminal prosecutions is an inalienable right under article 21 right to life of the constitution this right is applicable not only to the actual proceedings in court but also includes within its sweep the preceding police investigation as well
4807426 all criminal persecutions and is not confined to any particular category of cases

4807488 we hope that its not a catalog of things that have been done so much as a series of ideas about what we could do what could be done
4807489 if we are to meet the challenges that we face i believe what is required are governmental led initiatives that are matched by and propelled by a kind of bottom up grassroots movement
4807490 i dont think you can have one without the other

4807493 add together the unfunded liabilities from medicare and social security and it comes to 99 2 trillion over the infinite horizon traditional medicare composes about 69 percent the new drug benefit roughly 17 percent and social security the remaining 14 percent
4807494 lets say you and i and bruce ericson and every u s citizen who is alive today decided to fully address this unfunded liability through lump sum payments from our own pocketbooks so that all of us and all future generations could be secure in the knowledge that we and they would receive promised benefits in perpetuity how much would we have to pay if we split the tab again the math is painful with a total population of 304 million from infants to the elderly the per person payment to the federal treasury would come to 330 000 this comes to 1 3 million per family of four over 25 times the average households income

4807560 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
4807561 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
4807562 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
4807563 these 29 percent are like undecided voters they would be an especially good focus for intervention
4807564 our results suggest that interventions may have a real opportunity to influence at least a quarter of the student population
4807565 we need to do more to recognize integrity among our students and find ways to tap into the bravery honest and empathy that was found in the academic heroes in our study

4807578 lets say you and i and bruce ericson and every u s citizen who is alive today decided to fully address this unfunded liability through lump sum payments from our own pocketbooks so that all of us and all future generations could be secure in the knowledge that we and they would receive promised benefits in perpetuity how much would we have to pay if we split the tab again the math is painful with a total population of 304 million from infants to the elderly the per person payment to the federal treasury would come to 330 000 this comes to 1 3 million per family of four over 25 times the average households income

4807598 theres a strong stigma in these areas about the disease that prevents people from getting treatment

4807601 high risk sexual behavior makes transmission more probable we have to be able to talk about sexuality in order for prevention to work

4807657 large numbers of corroding depleted uranium penetrators embedded in the ground might pose a long term threat if the uranium leaches into water supplies
4807658 long term environmental sampling particularly of water and milk is required and provides a cost effective method of monitoring sensitive components of the environment and of providing information about uranium levels to concerned local populations monitoring may need to be enhanced in some areas by site specific risk assessment if the situation warrants further consideration

4807660 a shift of leukemia incidence rates towards younger children during the recent years
4807661 in aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du
4807662 the chemical risks of breathing in uranium dust are so low that it wont cause any long term health risks
4807663 radioactive material and waste will not be locally disposed of through burial submersion incineration destruction in place or abandonment without approval from overall commander
4807664 if local disposal is approved the responsible commander must document the general nature of the disposed material and the exact location of the disposal
4807665 the fire and explosions damaged or destroyed 102 vehicles including four m1a1 tanks and numerous other combat vehicles more than two dozen buildings sustained damage as well among the estimated almost 15 million in damaged or destroyed ammunition were 660 m829 120mm du sabot rounds
4807666 personnel packing the drums with du penetrators wore surgeons caps safety glasses half face protective masks coveralls butyl rubber aprons rubber surgeons gloves with cotton inserts and rubber booties over their normal work boots a total of eight drums were filled with about 250 du penetrators
4807667 under the circumstances the army had no legal obligation to clean up the particulate material
4807668 the soil is not regulated as radioactive material by the us department of transportation
4807669 the army is responsible for characterizing the material for the purposes of complying with transportation and disposal requirements the epa does not have a specific standard related to depleted uranium for the purposes of disposal depleted uranium is considered a low level radioactive waste and is subject to u s nuclear regulatory commission regulations
4807670 the sand with small amounts of depleted uranium being sent to the u s ecology idaho facility for disposal contains exempt concentrations of uranium less than 0 5 percent weight if the concentrations were greater than this we would have oversight
4807671 during my entire tour one could say that i was in the loop in the know about operations
4807672 my notes from all of the meetings we had and we had meetings twice a day every day and many times having a meeting or two in between i can still not find one mention of potential health hazards from depleted uranium or the possible contamination of any area at camp doha
4807673 i have what they call ibs irritable bowel syndrome but theyve not been able to treat it with any success it creates constant bad bad cramping in the lower abdomen severe fatigue bad joint pain all of the norms rolled up into the gulf war illness tag
4807674 as for what i believe is the cause of my declining health
4807675 there were three constants when i arrived a doha there were the burning oil well fires there was a constant presence of insects pesticides and then there was the du ive always believed that there is more to the du than the us government and dod would like us to believe
4807676 young childrens exposure to depleted uranium must be monitored and preventive measures taken and heavily affected impact zones for depleted uranium munitions should be cordoned off and cleaned up
4807677 doctors in afghanistan say rates of some health problems affecting children have doubled in the last two years some scientists say the rise is linked to use of weapons containing depleted uranium du by the u s led coalition that invaded the country in 2001 a canadian research group found very high levels of uranium in afghans during tests just after the invasion a u s forces spokesman denied its weapons were affecting the health of afghans or the countrys environment
4807678 ever since its use by the allied forces in the first war against iraq there have been serious concerns about the radiological and chemical toxicity of the fine uranium particles produced when such weapons impact on hard targets concerns have also been expressed about the contamination of soil and groundwater by expended rounds that have missed their targets and their implications for civilian populations despite the fact that scientific research has so far been unable to find conclusive evidence of harm there are numerous testimonies as to the harmful and often deadly effects on both military personnel and civilians the last few years have seen great advances in terms of understanding the environmental and health hazards posed by depleted uranium and whereas it is high time that this was reflected in international military standards as they develop the use of depleted uranium in warfare runs counter to the basic rules and principles enshrined in written and customary international humanitarian and environmental law
4807679 there is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to link du with the ill health of either gulf or balkans veterans or people living in these regions many independent reports have been produced and researchers continue to consider the battlefield effects of using du munitions these reports include work by the royal society the european commission the united nations environment programme unep and the world health organization who none of these organizations has found a connection between du exposure and illness and none has found widespread du contamination sufficient to impact the health of the general population or deployed personnel
4807680 to undertake every measure possible to ensure that depleted uranium weapons of mass destruction are banned forever
4807681 belgium has banned the use of uranium in all conventional weapon systems however at least 18 countries including the u s use depleted uranium in their arsenals they are considered weapons of mass destruction under international law according to a canada u s agreement canadian uranium exports may only be used for peaceful purposes
4807682 because natural uranium in the general environment is mostly in large particles created from natural weathering processes the body seems to be able to eject these but weapons uranium dust is formed at very high temperature into ultra fine particles described as aerosols that can pass through cell walls etc in the lungs these will go into soft tissue and stay there rather than being coughed out
4807683 have accumulated many types of waste and contamination over the years the federal government estimated its environmental liability to clean up this waste at 249 billion in fiscal year 2004

4807694 we have been focused on economic costs and benefits and health and safety but they are only part of the puzzle
4807695 were suggesting that when you evaluate whether an oversight system is appropriate that you look at these multiple dimensions the ethical the social and legal and risk based
4807696 in laboratory studies when you inject rats with carbon nanomaterials they change and they are shown to damage lungs
4807697 high level policy framework where the regulatory agencies responsible for nanotechnology get together and publish guidance documents and policies as to how they can actually oversee nanotechnology under existing laws
4807698 i think it needs to be industry groups working together with public health working together with the minnesota pollution control agency but i think the mandate to coordinate between these groups must come from the highest levels of the state
4807699 there are dozens of companies in the u s that are producing carbon nanotubes and some minnesota companies are doing lab work with respect to nanotubes and to my knowledge they are all being extremely careful in adopting the latest mechanisms that there are for safety
4807700 nanomaterials have existed in nature for hundreds of thousands of years and so having nanoparticles around in the atmosphere is not something thats an invention of the last 15 years
4807701 in that example drugs have been used in military applications for alertness for probably at least a few years and i dont know that thats particularly a nanotechnology related matter
4807702 i think if there were evidence that the social and ethical and legal issues were of equal or greater importance than the health and safety i dont doubt that our membership would be interested in funding directives in that fashion
4807703 after weve sat down with steven hopefully that will go through
4807704 hes a good player and i felt we needed that in our midfield
4807705 i have to say that blackburn deserved the victory the third goal was offside but i think that the linesmen are going to find it very difficult this season the lineman didnt see it it was very difficult to see along the line with all the bodies in there but that cost us
4807706 thats not the only reason i would have been disappointed if we had only got a draw but no doubt with the side we had out and the way we performed throughout the game i might have been happy with a draw

4807721 los angeles county and orange county are two of the nations strongest industrial markets we believe that both properties are well positioned to continue their solid performance due to limited land supply and construction activity the smaller tenant nature of these properties and the close proximity to workforce and executive housing each of these properties offer excellent upside opportunity to increase operating income as current below market rents can be adjusted to market upon lease rollover these premier industrial properties are expected to generate solid returns for our investors over the long term
4807722 there are shortages of workers in many professions and trades these broad consultations with stakeholders have provided us with a picture of the most common and acute pressures across the country and how immigration can play a role in addressing them
4807723 our government is committed to helping newcomers and their families succeed when they come to canada their success is our success
4807724 we cant prioritize occupations and professions in demand if there isnt the necessary support and training available to help newcomers begin work in their chosen fields
4807725 we need to ensure that canada continues to balance the needs of our canadian industries in terms of labour shortages and family reunification for our newcomers

4807762 i was expecting he would go for a world record time but it is a real honor to be swimming with michael phelps
4807763 it was great that all eyes were on me and looking at the guy who could beat michael phelps its a pity we didnt both finish at 50 58 i would have loved to share that gold
4807764 beforehand coach bob bowman said it would be good for me if i lost
4807765 wen he said that i was fired up i said im going to go for it
4807766 i came wanting to win as many races as i could getting as many personal bests i could
4807767 i have seven out of seven so far i dont know what to say

4807770 its great to win a medal i cant take it off im not angry
4807771 it was just a great race to be a part of just a spectacle
4807772 i came here to prove that im the best in the world and i did that
4807773 as soon as i saw i had covered the field and knew i would win i was very happy and started to celebrate
4807774 the injury was a setback to my training but thats no excuse because my hamstring feels fine
4807775 i just wanted to get on the podium and i knew that is what it would take
4807776 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull the match out
4807777 its a huge moment for our country and im sure all the fans in russia will be happy about it
4807778 he came and talked to us last night and watched the tapes of the previous games
4807779 he said he was ready to come back he needed time to take care of his personal business and we respected that but we managed to take care of business on the court while he was gone anyway hes a great guy and its good to have him back
4807780 i dont think we expected today to turn out as it did
4807781 you always dream of it but we cant expect it we were the underdogs going into our matches and a lot of the other teams didnt expect us to be as strong as we were
4807782 it was a bad fight but its the olympics there is no such thing as a bad day at the olympics
4807783 ive been in a worse situation before when we were losing 13 7 in the world championships in 2001 and we ended up winning 15 13
4807784 today they were serving well but then when we won our first point in the third set i felt an energy shift and then we were back in the game
4807785 you dont know how its going to turn out all you can control is going out there and playing good baseball
4807786 the same thing happened against korea we were behind against cuba and came back but we had to have this one the guys showed a lot of character coming back
4807787 i feel sad but actually its ok for us im so happy we made a record for the u s team
4807788 we could have won if we would have taken more chances
4807789 i was just thinking hang in there hang in there the whole way and just go harder
4807790 as a collective unit i think this was the best 70 minutes
4807791 it always feels better when youre on the winning side of things
4807792 we just had a training run where we drilled penalty corners
4807793 when xie xingfang fought back in the third game i thought it might be too hard to win
4807794 after the previous four matches in the competition i have been very exhausted and today i felt tired
4807795 when i missed the low house shot it only made me more determined
4807796 i was fourth in the qualification with a score of 580
4807797 i was sure that i had a chance to win with this score though it is not my personal best 583 is
4807798 its my focus to try again at age 51 its a very good feeling to get medals
4807799 i think i can speak for all the athletes that we all shot pretty bad
4807800 i was fourth in the qualification with a score of 580

4807804 i believe i will break more world record in the coming years
4807805 they have proven to be one of the best teams here
4807806 and to be able to control this game and win by two goals shows our teams capabilities

4807849 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4807850 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4807851 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4807870 assurance of salvation is not to be obtained so much by self examination as by action
4807871 such hypocrites are so conceited of their own wisdom and so blinded and hardened with a very great self righteousness but very subtle and secret under the disguise of great humility and so invincible a fondness of their pleasing conceit of their great exaltation that it usually signifies nothing at all to lay before them the most convincing evidences of their hypocrisy

4807873 the purpose of this paragraph is to show peters readers that the spiritual blessings they now have are greater than anything that was envisaged by the old testament prophets or even by the angels thus peter seeks to increase his readers appreciation for their great salvation in christ
4807874 peter is saying then that the old testament prophets eagerly searched and investigated their own prophesies other scripture and their own times in order to find out who or what time the spirit of christ was indicating when he the spirit in them was predicting the sufferings of christ and the glories of his kingdom since we now know the answers to who jesus and what time jesus lifetime and the subsequent church age we should read the old testament prophets eagerly expecting that our hearts will often be stirred to praise when there we discover as a central theme the sufferings of our saviour on our behalf and the glories of the resultant kingdom of which we even now are members
4807875 peter tells his readers ancient prophets predicted the grace that would be yours v 10 you live in the great time of glories v 11 which was long foretold the prophets were in fact repeatedly ministering for the benefit of you v 12a and world changing event have now been proclaimed to you through the working of the holy spirit sent in epoch changing new power from heaven v 12b though the world may think such christians insignificant and worthy of pity or scorn see 3 14 16 4 4 angels who see ultimate reality from gods perspective find them to be objects of intense interest v 12c for they know that these struggling believers are actually the recipients of gods greatest blessings and honored participants in a great drama at the focal point of universal history

4807878 the stuff thats left behind now is being used its a residual that before was simply wasted
4807879 we recognized there was an opportunity in using them for biofuel so we developed a biofibre policy whereby we would be able to look at that from a fuel perspective
4807880 it is an arena that has a lot of potential but its not a silver bullet and right now its being painted as a sort of bullet to the forestry industry and for climate change as well
4807881 whereas it has potential in both of those camps to some extent looking at it as a silver bullet as opposed to just one of the dimensions of the overall tool kit is very dangerous
4807882 we dont see that the government has taken any of our comments seriously at all and are not looking at it through the lens of long term forest health
4807883 if it is necessary to provide baseline subsidies to biofibre projects is this a promising sign for an effective new forestry paradigm
4807884 die drie deden een heldendaad door hun collega te vervangen het gebeurt zelden dat wanneer zon tragedie zich voordoet bekende en succesrijke acteurs opstaan en zeggen ok we doen wat we kunnen om te helpen ze kwamen deden hun werk zorgden ervoor dat de film kon afgewerkt worden en storten hun geld door aan de dochter van heath dat is buitengewoon

4807887 is that a picture of jesus or barry gibb behi
4807888 mij viel het meteen op dat de motor zo stil was
4807889 ideaal dus dat we de ford kuga mochten uitproberen ik kende hem er is reclame genoeg voor gemaakt maar ik ben toch meteen naar de ford garage in de buurt gaan kijken de snoet vind ik prachtig de hoge achterkant was wennen de donkere tinten het zwart lederen interieur en de donkere ruiten hij zag er erg sportief uit mensen gaapten er ook naar
4807890 de kuga voelt heel anders aan dan onze eigen auto er zat heel wat nieuwe technologie in starten doe je met een startknop bijvoorbeeld sleutels zijn overbodig je mag wel niet vergeten te ontkoppelen zit en zithouding waren uitstekend goede verstelmogelijkheden bovendien mij viel het meteen op dat de motor zo stil was ik heb er zelfs anderhalve dag over gedaan om te beseffen dat het een diesel was
4807891 zes versnellingen een vlotte schakelbak en al die snufjes aan het stuur ik kon de radio bedienen aan het stuur maar ook de passagier kan nog altijd de radio bedienen cruise control zat er ook op maar verbazend knap was het gps wij hebben er geen maar dat zal niet lang meer duren een fijne optie is het immense glazen dak het interieur lijkt er groter door en tegelijk geeft het een cocongevoel kleine jasper 5 5 was vooral dol op de reistafeltjes achteraan
4807892 voor zon grote auto toch ik denk niet dat er veel meer in kan dan in onze golf wel kan je in een wip de banken plat leggen waardoor je fors aan ruimte wint ik heb drie jaar geleden eens met een gelijkaardige auto mogen rijden met de verkoper erbij weliswaar en dan zie je dat er in korte tijd toch veel evolueert
4807893 ik was toen enthousiast maar zou nu zeker deze auto verkiezen zou want ik twijfel toch ook weer het verbruik is me eigenlijk tegengevallen iets meer dan 8 l 100 km terwijl mijn oude golf met 7 2 l benzine toekomt ok hij is groter hoger en wellicht ook zwaarder de kuga maar doe ik er dan wel goed aan om een auto te kopen die hoe dan ook duurder is dan een gewone en bovendien ook meer verbruikt en wetend dat mijn vrouw het liever compacter zou houden

4808083 the picts have always been an attractive lost people they are one of the most interesting lost peoples of europe
4808084 the big question is what happened to them and did they ever really make a kingdom of their own
4808085 they would have been dreaming of a new rome and a new world connected by water rather than roman roads
4808086 they were the most extraordinary artists they could draw a wolf a salmon an eagle on a piece of stone with a single line and produce a beautiful naturalistic drawing nothing as good as this is found between portmahomack and rome even the anglo saxons didnt do stone carving as well as the picts did not until the post renaissance were people able to get across the character of animals just like that
4808087 the most important piece had a latin inscription thats as common as muck in the mediterranean but extremely rare in scotland
4808088 it says this is the cross of christ in memory of reo and the rest is broken away unfortunately the key bit the name of the person is missing it means theres someone around there who knows how to write in the eighth century that itself is a revelation

4808090 the golden section together with its inverse the golden number 1 618 has been valued by artists for millennia and it is a true delight to observe it among their architects
4808091 it shows the importance of symbol and worship in everything done in the service of the christian god
4808092 there is something rather intriguing in the learnt character of them this is a building put up to house metal workers its the idea they were all possessed of the same kind of knowledge and all trying to serve it
4808093 this is staggering to hear but im not totally surprised i think they were pretty sophisticated when you think of all the pictish stones and the wonderful carvings that they made a lot more sophisticated than perhaps they are given credit for in public perception
4808094 there was a war as important as alfreds against the danes in england and the picts got really battered in the annals of ulster there are records of battles where the flower of pictish aristocracy is killed
4808095 portmahomack got burnt down pretty definitively round about 820 the idea is they were under new masters it could be the norse or the men of moray macbeth and his family i think portmahomack was captured by the men of moray the norse wanted it badly but they didnt get it there is no norse material there there was no more vellum making and sculpture and it stopped being a monastery in the ninth to 11th centuries they are making metal work but thats the real dark age

4808120 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
4808121 there was clear eyed and bipartisan recognition after the attacks that we needed to be able and allowed to collect intelligence in the united states
4808122 under the new guidelines the investigative steps that the fbi may take in a particular investigation will not be driven by irrelevant factors such as the type of paperwork the agent uses to open the investigation
4808123 im concerned with the way the attorney general frames the problem
4808124 he talks about arbitrary or irrelevant differences between criminal and national security investigations but these were corrections originally designed to prevent the type of overreach the fbi engaged in for years
4808125 nobodys complaining about the fbi collecting domestic intelligence when its appropriate and authorized under the law
4808126 what the attorney general is doing is expanding the bureaus intelligence collection without addressing the mismanagement within the fbi if you have an agency collecting more with less oversight its only going to get worse

4808142 je ziet nu dat ieder stamhoofd met elk klein probleempje naar de afghaanse president karzai belt
4808143 met als gevolg dat niemand precies weet wat hij doet in uruzgan
4808144 ik word nooit verrast door een afghaan die zelf iets heeft geregeld

4808200 it wasnt in the fridge it was on the table
4808201 you are a left over taco still wrapped from last night that sat on a table for 16 hours
4808202 yes but i heated it up in the microwave it was good
4808203 sweetie eating old food that has meat or milk with it that has been sitting out for a long time is really really not a good idea trying not to sound squeaky with panic you could get very sick

4808219 el problema al que nos enfrentamos es estimar el n mero de individuos que componen una manada de lobos adultos y subadultos a trav s de las grabaciones de sus coros y colateralmente tambi n intentamos estimar la presencia de cachorros
4808220 este proceso de separaci n proporciona un arma poderosa para el estudio de la estructura de una manada ya que si dos voces tienen frecuencias instant neas proporcionales podemos suponer que se trata de dos arm nicos diferentes producidos por un mismo lobo y si no las tienen pero coinciden en el tiempo podemos asegurar que las emiten individuos distintos lo que nos permite estimar el n mero m nimo de lobos que han aullado o ladrado en el coro
4808221 podemos distinguir el n mero de voces que se escuchan cuando a llan a la vez pero si no suenan simult neamente desconocemos si son emitidas por el mismo individuo o no

4808365 the protest by cosatu is uncivilised and a criminal way of behaving with all the hallmarks of terrorism they are saboteurs and they should move away from the slavery mentality of trying to please whites
4808366 cosatu is led by brainless and misdirected people who should instead focus on poverty and xenophobic attacks in south africa
4808367 it has never happened in the history of politics that a labour body can organise such a criminal act

4808383 grotes writing is as likely to dabble in meta literary tricks as it is to trade in the sensationalism of science fiction comic books and supernatural yarns im very fascinated with that convergence between the heightened elements of genre entertainment and literary sophistication the bearded playwright said in a july interview in the woolly greenroom when the two sensibilities collide he added it illuminates both the mythical nature of these genre conventions but also the magical nature of the mundane and everyday that double edged approach to storytelling has impressed local theater power brokers hes one of our biggest thinking playwrights in america today says woolly artistic director howard shalwitz he doesnt write a play that doesnt have some gigantic idea embedded in it shalwitz points for instance to the spooky shape shifter whose haunting of the blood relatives in maria stuart invites you to think big thoughts
4808384 and the myths we carry from the past big is a word that crops up a lot in talk about grotes oeuvre hes not afraid to write a big play even in this day and age where it seems harder to get a big play produced
4808385 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes
4808386 during the hostilities weve seen no significant changes in routing
4808387 we risk underestimating the great patriotic rage of many ordinary russians who having been fed too much government propaganda in the last few days are convinced that they need to crash georgian web sites many russians undoubtedly went online to learn how to make mischief as i did

4808405 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
4808406 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4808407 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4808408 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4808409 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4808410 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4808411 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states fully recognizes this reality
4808412 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done but i would just note there are already consequences
4808413 there have been universal concern within the eu european union the united states about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4808414 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4808415 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4808416 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4808417 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4808418 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4808419 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4808420 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis

4808428 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
4808429 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
4808430 my daughter was very religious she was into the bible obsessed with it
4808431 they were going to show her the right way she got sucked into it
4808432 i fear for my grandsons and my daughters safety you see they are in a cult i havent seen or heard from my daughter since april
4808433 its a tragic tragic situation and we responded with the information that we had in a responsive way and unfortunately it didnt change the outcome
4808434 they were coaching her and telling her what to say
4808435 she sounded empty like an empty shell there was no emotion
4808436 i was shocked i didnt even recognize her voice its not the same person
4808437 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4808438 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4808439 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4808440 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
4808441 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4808442 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few

4808445 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
4808446 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
4808447 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4808448 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others

4808460 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4808461 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4808462 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4808463 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4808464 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4808465 we do not target children and do not promote phones to under 16s we recognise teenagers use phones but we have adopted the ethical policy not to target them if it is found that there is an increasing market appetite and we believe there are no ethical implications at that time then we would consider targeting under 16s
4808466 whilst it is clear the use of mobile phones by children is on the increase we must remember that child safety is paramount we understand there is a need in society today for more stringent controls regarding how mobiles are used by children and the content they are able to access however phones 4us core target market are 16 24 year olds and so all of its marketing efforts are focused on reaching those over the age of 16

4808470 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
4808471 the korean police at the time were notorious for fabricating evidence that didnt exist
4808472 it was truly an emotional moment for me to hear him say it
4808473 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
4808474 came to her begging her to save her my mother

4808478 the russian tanks on the streets of georgian towns remind us of the invasion in 1968
4808479 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
4808480 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4808481 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4808482 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4808483 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence
4808484 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4808485 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable
4808486 i remember this square was covered with the orange flags of democracy
4808487 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4808488 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
4808489 this should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a constitutional affair and that could only be done through the parliament
4808490 never indulges in the politics of revenge as it wants a stable pakistan and a sustainable democracy in the country
4808491 some people may say bad things about me even my own village is against me
4808492 it was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout by doing what he did
4808493 the day they took the marabout to prison it hurt me so much it was as if they had come to jail me
4808494 its my marabout that did this to me it forged me it allowed me to learn that i can overcome difficulty
4808495 i knew that he would be hit but i didnt think he would be hit up to this point
4808496 ask yourself what is this money used for the kids are not fed so its not for food they wear rags so its not for clothes they dont have mattresses so its not for their beds
4808497 this is a sham on a grand scale under the cover of religion
4808498 the parents of these children believe in these men so completely that when they hand over their sons they relinquish all control
4808499 they swear allegiance to the marabout and say that whatever happens to their son is for the childs good
4808500 my grandson can say whatever he wants but i know the truth
4808501 he was hit because he was lazy and refused to memorize his verses
4808502 were fine in race trim but we just suck in qualifying
4808503 we were alright in qualifying trim earlier but we just missed a lot when it came to getting it right
4808504 we may have been working in the wrong areas and now it seems like were working in the right areas and getting speed out of it
4808505 cheating the bad things good nascar nextel cup racers do in pursuit of speed
4808506 although i have been told by numerous people not to worry too much as all parents lose their patience with their kids i am most saddened that this was released to the media because of what it does to a child

4808514 if you ask those to whom this has happened they know that children shouldnt be left alone in the car but at that particular moment their minds are elsewhere they have some other problem
4808515 its not intentional by any means its like knowing that you shouldnt leave a child alone at the side of a swimming pool but in spite of that it happens
4808516 when it comes to leaving a child in a car these people have obviously had difficulties or are preoccupied by other things had other things to do during several hours and at the last moment forget that there is a child still in the car
4808517 let there be many many many very happy returns xxx

4808522 seeking economic justice in a world of need what then must we do
4808523 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4808524 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4808525 shall be commander in chief of the defense forces of zimbabwe
4808526 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation
4808527 finally to make fully clear to robert mugabe that a new government in zimbabwe that must reflect the will of the zimbabwean population is necessary
4808528 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery
4808529 serious blot on the culture of democracy in our subregion
4808530 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4808531 must be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of georgia
4808532 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4808533 georgia is a member of the united nations and south ossetia and abkhazia lie within its internationally recognized borders
4808534 georgias borders should command the same respect as every other nations
4808535 i am a true apple fan so this is nothing to make apple look bad i think apple should come out and tell people whats going on with these phones
4808536 my calls get dropped a lot and im not even moving one inch anywhere

4808538 i cant explain it the advantage for the freestyle is probably now for anky

4808542 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4808543 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4808544 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4808545 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4808546 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4808547 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4808548 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4808549 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4808550 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4808551 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4808552 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4808553 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4808554 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4808555 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4808556 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4808557 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4808558 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4808559 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4808560 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4808561 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4808562 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4808563 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing

4808578 he was cursing and telling us to get off the property get off my property get these people off my property i mean he was just screaming yelling and i was just standing there in disbelief because i couldnt believe mr mayor would do something like that
4808579 i dont know what asking a question proves that isnt proof of anything
4808580 this guy is the focus of broad ranging inquiries at the state level
4808581 i wouldnt be surprised if theyre asking questions about him

4808591 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
4808592 my daughter was very religious she was into the bible obsessed with it
4808593 they were going to show her the right way she got sucked into it

4808739 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4808740 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone

4808762 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4808763 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4808764 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4808765 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence
4808766 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict

4808785 lo que pareciera es que los venezolanos aspiran m s bien a un sistema socialdem crata como se entiende el socialismo en europa brasil chile
4808786 esta es una situaci n diametralmente opuesta a la que vimos en febrero de 2006 cuando 55 prefer a el socialismo y 22 el capitalismo

4808794 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
4808795 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
4808796 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
4808797 these 29 percent are like undecided voters they would be an especially good focus for intervention
4808798 our results suggest that interventions may have a real opportunity to influence at least a quarter of the student population
4808799 we need to do more to recognize integrity among our students and find ways to tap into the bravery honest and empathy that was found in the academic heroes in our study

4808898 in this article the authors argue that the overwhelming portion of the literature on intelligence race and genetics is based on folk taxonomies rather than scientific analysis they suggest that because theorists of intelligence disagree as to what it is any consideration of its relationships to other constructs must be tentative at best they further argue that race is a social construction with no scientific definition thus studies of the relationship between race and other constructs may serve social ends but cannot serve scientific ends no gene has yet been conclusively linked to intelligence so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time the authors also show that heritability a behaviorgenetic concept is inadequate in regard to providing such a link

4809019 stay where you are dont put yourself at risk no matter how good it looks
4809020 i am certain that such a scenario is not possible in ukraine
4809021 prosperity peace and calm in crimea is the very foundation on which the interests of ukraine and neighboring russia coincide everything else is of secondary importance
4809022 if we complete this stage and go on to the next one we can be confident that there will be no russian or any other destabilization scenario in crimea
4809023 i have therefore sent an urgent proposal to the president of russia to start talks on signing an agreement that would regulate our relations in the event of military action like that which we saw at the beginning of august
4809024 in other words we need to come up with clearer rules that would ensure ukraines national security in such situations
4809025 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4809026 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4809027 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4809028 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4809029 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4809030 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4809031 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4809051 its the first victory and you should have seen the boys in the dressing room
4809052 they were absolutely over the moon celebrating it meant a lot to them and hopefully now we will learn from this game again
4809053 too many people are being killed on the roads of teesside simply because they are driving too fast
4809054 we want drivers to realise that excessive speed is as dangerous as drink driving and to understand that by sticking to the legal speed limits of the roads unnecessary deaths can be prevented
4809055 by working closely with the european traffic police network we can work together to reduce speed and reduce the number of those killed on the roads
4809056 fortunately we passed the ground inspection by the northern league so that means we can play games at home now which was a relief
4809057 frankly i didnt think we were going to make it but all the stops were pulled out and everybody did a magnificent job for us
4809058 however we are still looking for financial support the work at the ground is on going because the criteria is changing next year its important that we dont stand still or we could be back in the same position without a ground in march
4809059 this football club keeps the towns name on the map and the club is also about an awful lot of juniors who play down there
4809060 there are about 100 kids who play down there instead of hanging around the streets its a little club but it could be marvellous
4809061 anybody who supports thornaby as a town should support the club i would ask everyone to dig in their pockets and give what they can to the football club
4809062 they have managed to do the basics and have done some good work on the ground

4809068 our operation had both civilian and military targets there are no civilian targets its civilian in quotation marks the zionists themselves define the israeli as a soldier who is on leave for 11 months every year
4809069 the assassination of sadat was a most wonderful operation it was a wonderful historical moment which i hope will recur in similar cases
4809070 on examination mr johnson was alert and oriented in three spheres
4809071 when they were singing that song tonight the spirit came on me and said todd because you asked like very few men on the face of the earth ask to see my glory i will begin a revival through you that will pass beyond gifts into the very heart that moves god to release gifts to his children and jesus filled with compassion healed the sick and jesus filled with forgiveness said he who is without sin cast the first stone and jesus filled with justice and truth threw over tables and took out whips and cleansed the temple of god and todd i have chosen you because of your background because of your background because of your background to release my nature when you release my gifts to become a living epistle like the word that became flesh and people saw the glory of god and i will use you to father a movement that operates in such revival power but it is coming out of the very nature and heart of god and you will teach people how to behold god until they are transformed from glory to glory from compassion to mercy to lovingkindness to truth to justice to forgiveness and a whole generation will move in such signs and wonders and power but everyone will give glory to god and i feel like todd that when you were twelve years old and i just graduated from baptist seminary the holy spirit fell on me and he started to speak to me over and over and over again about a generation that would come on the earth that would do signs and wonders that would change society and society would not change them and you are a firstfruit of that generation of nation changers that will release the glory of god in all its fullness in jesus name
4809072 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
4809073 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
4809074 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
4809075 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
4809076 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
4809077 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
4809078 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
4809079 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
4809080 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
4809081 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

4809094 everybody is aware of the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions but it can be difficult for people to find ways of doing something about it
4809095 it was a highly complex shape and we were looking for technology that was cheap enough to cover most of the outer surface
4809096 we managed to have something integrated and cheap enough that it doesnt have to be refinanced through advertising

4809154 weve done a good job of signing players in the dominican
4809155 rafi reyes a 16 year old dominican whom the white sox signed for a 525 000 bonus last summer according to official major league documents a major league club official said last week that reyes was one of the white sox players whose payment had been improperly handled that he received a small fraction of his bonus perhaps as little as 75 000 with the rest being divvied up among reyess buscon and white sox scouts a high level white sox official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter confirmed that reyes was one of four or five players in the organization whose signing was under investigation
4809156 reyes a fast center fielder with large hands and a ready smile said that he had received 525 000 from the white sox the full bonus agreed to by david wilder himself reyes said that he owed no portion to a buscon because his father rafael reyes sierra ran a baseball program in his hometown baharona and handled the negotiations for him

4809162 were in a tricky position right now because we have one or two bad finishes where we could find ourselves very easily slipping back and not be secure going into the final pre chase race at richmond
4809163 we want to be secure going into richmond and so these next couple of weeks if we put good finishes together then we might be in a position to take some more risks i say risks its experimenting with things that youre testing its taking gambles on pit strategy calls those types of things

4809173 ich bin ins qualifying mit einem wohl zu harten reifen gegangen aber wir mussten das tun um f r michelin ein paar informationen zu sammeln
4809174 nach einiger zeit habe ich die weichen aufgezogen und dann wurde der regen unglaublich das war meiner lage nicht gerade f rderlich ich bin aber nicht sicher ob ich mich noch entscheidend mehr h tte verbessern k nnen wenn es nicht geregnet h tte
4809175 es w re allzu leicht gewesen zu viele risiken einzugehen und einen unfall zu bauen es war wie in deutschland vor einigen wochen als ich w hrend des rennens im nassen auch einige probleme hatte ich habe einfach versucht best ndig grip aufzubauen das gab mir die sicherheit weiter druck zu machen sollte es morgen trocken sein wie die wettervorhersage glaubhaft macht dann k nnen wir hoffentlich im warmup noch einige wichtige informationen f r einen guten kampf im rennen sammeln
4809176 es war ein sehr schwieriger tag f r mich und das tech 3 yamaha team morgen werde ich aber da sein und ob es regnet oder die sonne scheint meine maximale leistung abliefern so wie ich es immer mache ich werfe nicht das handtuch egal wie schwierig es noch werden wird
4809177 ich denke dass es offensichtlich ist wo die probleme waren wenn man sich die rundenzeiten ansieht
4809178 ich klage aber deswegen niemanden an es ist einfach mein job da drau en mit dem aktuellem paket den bestm glichen job abzuliefern und genau das werde ich tun wenn aber nicht alle teile des paketes zueinander passen wird es sehr schwierig
4809179 bei dem unfall in der ersten kurve gab es nichts was ich h tte tun k nnen ich habe nicht versucht irgendwelche bertriebenen aktionen zu starten weil es unter diesen bedingungen nicht m glich war sich zu verbessern ich bin einfach grundlos abgeflogen und das ist sehr entt uschend wir werden sehen was morgen so passiert aber der regen wird die strecke wieder verschmutzt haben und das k nnte auf slick reifen etwas kompliziert werden wenn das rennen trocken ist ich mag es nicht von hinten zu starten wenn ich aber gut wegkomme kann es noch ein gutes rennen werden

4809200 with the fall in oil and other commodity prices in the past month both the markets and fed officials had started to turn away from inflation risks and focus on growth risks
4809201 the view which we agree with is that with the usual long and variable lags falling commodity prices and rising unemployment will drive down inflation no need for the fed to get its hands dirty when the housing and credit crunch will do the job

4809267 teams of college students design a solar house knowing from the outset that it must be powered entirely by the sun in a quest to stretch every last watt of electricity thats generated by the solar panels on their roofs the students absorb the lesson that energy is a precious commodity they strive to innovate using high tech materials and design elements in ingenious ways along the way the students learn how to raise funds and communicate about team activities they collect supplies and talk to contractors they build their solar houses learning as they go

4809277 when it comes to leaving a child in a car these people have obviously had difficulties or are preoccupied by other things had other things to do during several hours and at the last moment forget that there is a child still in the car

4809300 i never miss a meal so hopefully i can put a few back on right now
4809301 it was 1st and 4 now its 1st and 9
4809302 why dont you give them an interview while youre down there
4809303 some of the defense had the wrong attitude and it showed because the offense torched us
4809304 i am confident that none of the documents have been released
4809305 i was shocked that something like this would occur i never dreamed it would i deeply regret that this happened
4809306 it was way out of reason the suspect in this case thought his information was worth a whole lot more it was more than you could by a steak with
4809307 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4809308 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4809309 shall be commander in chief of the defense forces of zimbabwe
4809310 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation
4809311 finally to make fully clear to robert mugabe that a new government in zimbabwe that must reflect the will of the zimbabwean population is necessary
4809312 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery

4809316 this should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a constitutional affair and that could only be done through the parliament
4809317 never indulges in the politics of revenge as it wants a stable pakistan and a sustainable democracy in the country
4809318 oh just wondering how buckbeaks getting along i thought i mightve heard him
4809319 now what could be worrying me when ive got a naked witch in my bed
4809320 no never you dora its sirius im i cant stop thinking about him
4809321 every day he seems more unstable more moody and unpredictable
4809322 it would be so very like him to do something stupid
4809323 i suppose dangerous and impulsive would be better words than stupid he isnt stupid far from it
4809324 dora he isnt used to being alone with time on his hands
4809325 part of it is that hes jealous of me of us he doesnt want to be but he is and that only makes it worse for him every day that he spends shut up in this house hes forced to see me getting everything that he wants
4809326 what are you are you suggesting that sirius wants to get into my knickers and hes going to do something drastic because youre getting into them instead
4809327 he doesnt look it now but hes always been a a ladies man i suppose youd call him back then in the first war he invariably had a woman or two the rest of us well sometimes we got lucky sometimes not more often not
4809328 but sirius was it was simply part of who he was if you could have seen him then youd know what im trying to say picture it cast off scion of a rich old family founding member of the order of the phoenix dashing into danger at a moments notice and coming home with a few new curse scars and another war story to tell and always always a beautiful willing woman warming his bed eager to spread her legs for him
4809329 hm is that what hes jealous of then the way i spread my legs to welcome my hero home from battle
4809330 um remus listen sirius was in azkaban for years you say how difficult it is for him to be alone now but he was alone in prison yeah he had years to learn to deal with it and did deal with it by all accounts remarkably well and
4809331 sirius is with us remus with all of us he isnt alone anymore we wont let him do anything stupid
4809332 we had recovered about 40 vehicles from eight persons working with car theft gangs and on the basis of information received from them had sent a team to madhya pradesh who are there
4809333 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4809334 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4809335 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record
4809336 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4809337 he paid for it he paid for the work that was absolutely necessary
4809338 making that connection is absolutely in bounds and we would be remiss if we didnt
4809339 i am determined to celebrate this occasion despite all the hardships such as heat and security concerns
4809340 i feel that the situation is better now because i notice that there is more security i am happy to be here today
4809341 i hope that these measures will prevent the terrorists from carrying attacks and bombings in the holy city
4809342 a guy in his stature what hes done in this league to be on a new team now it is going to be a media circus for that game
4809343 i dont know how im going to react when i see brett favre in a jets uniform
4809344 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4809345 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4809346 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4809347 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4809348 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4809349 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4809350 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4809351 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4809352 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4809353 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4809354 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4809355 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4809356 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4809357 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4809358 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4809359 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4809360 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4809361 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4809362 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4809363 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4809364 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4809365 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4809366 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4809367 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing

4809377 a proposito della legge elettorale per le europee si rileva che il presidente della repubblica stato solo informato tempo addietro dal ministro roberto calderoli degli orientamenti a cui questi prevedeva potesse ispirarsi la nuova disciplina il capo dello stato non ha successivamente avuto alcuna occasione di pronunciarsi in merito con nessuno
4809378 statistical surveys have shown that design and visualisation have a verifiable impact on business performance visual articulation is important when solving a problem that involves strategic goals and initiatives at its core it helps bridge the problem or opportunity with the solution that is why helping decision makers to think and express themselves visually gives organisations a competitive edge in the marketplace

4809383 this reminds me of the story of the kiwakw marching in the shadows of caves and old woods to prey on the lonely
4809384 i dont know what i do and dont believe in anymore
4809385 then believe in odzihozo the self created titan with no legs whose dragged body lends the world its contours
4809386 so what happens to him in the end of the story
4809387 they cant notice only one of us can they they need a group
4809388 i believe so monsieur corbeau the moos bas are indeed interested in us but not if we are too few or spread too thin the object of their design seeks a mass gathering of human beings a crowd
4809389 once it has expended its supply of defensive effluvium it must spend a week to generate a fresh supply as a matter of biological economics a skunk is obliged to be selective in whom it targets
4809390 youre saying these things are going to start spraying people
4809391 i think im following you detective you think theyll get the best bang for their buck if theyre attracted to crowds right you think theyre somehow rigged up that way
4809392 then theyre not really moos bas are they not really
4809393 theyre something else entirely this isnt about the ghost world at all this is about a weapon
4809394 we should go back and call the cops right or maybe animal control or the army i dont know but we gotta call somebody
4809395 what the hell are we going to do a bunch of dumb indians sweating in the dark
4809396 close your mouth gerard you whine like a white man and doubt like one too
4809397 if i hear you speak against our kind again ill thrash you as if you was still a kid right
4809398 being indians isnt our weakness today its our strength remember that were hunting animals in the dark we are in our element you will not spit on the memories of our ancestors by being a coward
4809399 we will track them with our feelings when i was young i could smell a deers walk after the rain
4809400 we must have penetrated through to the old catacombs eh
4809401 four hundred years ago the iroquoians built them to hide their people from champlain they moved underground rather than die at the feet of france
4809402 the hochelaga iroquoians disappeared over two thousand of them in a single season they left no descendants no words no graves
4809403 some say they moved to the centre of the earth and that theyre still there living in peace where europe can never touch them
4809404 its air moving right you hear it in caves its nothing
4809405 you know what it almost sounds like i swear i could almost hear a train down there
4809406 this could be important i hear it too its receding now quiet can you hear
4809407 it is a train could it be the lost iroquoians
4809408 in my experience monsieur corbeau people who wonder too freely about inexplicable subterranean railways tend to meet unpleasant ends
4809409 but theyre not leaving me alone here help ger detective help me
4809410 come to me raccoon spirit ive never needed you more
4809411 lighter than air fragile to have a significant effect it may need to be released in an enclosed space
4809412 it seemed to have a pretty fucking significant effect on etienne
4809413 lets keep moving its what he wouldve wanted right you with me
4809414 its its incredible how could this its practically a whole city be sitting here underground under montreal for four hundred years with nobody knowing about it
4809415 the mink tracks go off this way come on any idea which direction that is
4809416 you got a compass built into that trick leg of yours guy
4809417 what the hell is that its just hanging in the air too big to be a firefly
4809418 observe carefully that is the underside of the head the apparent eyes are false like the eyes on a butterflys wing watch as it turns there much tinier eyes on either side of the antennae those are the real ones
4809419 its kind of like a stick insect or maybe a praying mantis its just a bug eh but why does it look like it has a freaking face
4809420 i cant be sure without taking a nap can i use your lap for a pillow
4809421 there are any number of reasons why one species might grow to simulate the appearance of another but i do not think the usual forces of natural selection are in play here this is like the mottling on the awa hon do carapaces or the white patches around the eyes of the moos bas an external agency has acted upon their lines to artificially select for human resemblance
4809422 like i said i cant be sure without testing it in sleep but one possibility does suggest itself
4809423 the same reasons people have ever had for rendering human likenesses to aid in the formation of a relationship with a non human object it is totem sir
4809424 this is why the megaliths of easter island have faces this is why our architecture is designed according to the proportions of the body it is an age old way of subverting the social emotions and repurposing them to stimulate a bond and thereby sensitize perceptions
4809425 a large part of the brain sir is devoted to navigating the subtleties of a bio social existence this powerful subsystem can be harnessed for other purposes people have done so for at least a hundred thousand years anthropomorphizing aspects of their environment in order to engage with them using social tools
4809426 the brain is a highly flexible organ but its emotions leave their mark i believe these animals may have been bred by someone alienated from society as servants and substitutes
4809427 it is possible we have no way of knowing but their current function seems clear enough they are signposts lighting the way
4809428 observe in the distance there is another and another after that
4809429 i used to work for public works when i was teenager right this gives us the direction and distance to the pump a hundred and six meters north by northwest
4809430 unless im totally lost though i cant figure out why wed be near a substation i mean the water pressure is managed centrally on the island itself except
4809431 except for the big o guy except for the freaking stade right oh no
4809432 were heading right underneath the olympic stadium detective and its a summer weekend night there could be sixty thousand people up there
4809433 i mean that my artificial limb has run out of power it may have been drained when i caught etienne at the chasm
4809434 once we get out of here you can turn the key to wind up the auxiliary motor ill only be able to move my digits and wrist and not with much strength but it will have to do until i can get to an electrical outlet
4809435 yeah but how are we going to climb out of here if you cant climb
4809436 i will be forced to presume upon your strength sir
4809437 oh great this is going to be fun i can just tell
4809438 come up beneath me i will i will sit on your shoulders
4809439 this one is for you the other is so you can save someone
4809440 seems like a lot of trouble to save just one person doesnt it
4809441 certainty not this is a private function for the monsanto company ill thank you to leave immediately
4809442 i dont know what sort of tomfoolery this is but you will leave this instant and i advise you to collect your personal effects because within an hour youll be without jobs
4809443 but i do know that is a question that is only ever asked by people i dont care for
4809444 i resent that just because im an indian and im disrupting your shit doesnt mean im drunk thats racism eh
4809445 you would rather squirm and scamper to save your pathetically small life
4809446 im not surprised i never am anymore flee mrs gillis but dont bother coming to the office tomorrow or ever again
4809447 silence for sport and victory i will clear this up personally
4809448 taking control of a situation is simply a matter of preparation and decisiveness you brave on the floor
4809449 were working to avert a tragedy sir your actions imperil thousands
4809450 first youre going to lie on your front with your hands laced behind your head second youre going to tell me why you have gas masques
4809451 i will shoot you both i own too many judges to bother thinking twice about it
4809452 vivono in rosso regioni come la campania la sicilia o la calabria se venissero lasciate a se stesse come richiesto da un federalismo intransigente dovrebbero chiudere gli ospedali e magari anche le scuole
4809453 niet doen irm dat is niet aardig maar luisteren ho maar
4809454 we would have liked to move ahead with the project
4809455 but we saw that the preparations are not yet sufficient and we instructed our energy ministries to carry out a more detailed work
4809456 undoubtedly turkey has allies undoubtedly turkey differs with iran on many issues but we would regret it if some would think that we do things because someone tells us to do so
4809457 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
4809458 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4809459 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4809460 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today
4809461 tu puedes tener tu religi n y yo puedo tener la m a
4809462 if you dont laugh at this then there is something seriously wrong with you
4809463 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4809464 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4809465 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4809466 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4809467 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4809468 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4809469 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4809470 eusebio adalah simbol di portugal dan di dunia sepakbola sekrang saya akan meminta presiden inter milan massimo moratti memberi izin agar saya bisa meletakkan trofi itu di kantor saya
4809471 kami melakukan pertandingan itu dengan brilian itu pertandingan penting bagi benfica karena turnamen itu baru pertama kali digelar tapi kami mampu mendominasi permainan di depan suporter mereka
4809472 ada beberapa peluang mencetak gol dan mungkin kami juga berhak atas hadiah penalti sementara secara keseluruhan benfica hanya punya dua peluang saya bahagia dengan permainan itu karena kami tidak tampil lengkap
4809473 makanya ini cukup memuaskan apalagi kami tak kemasukan satu gol pun sangat menyenangkan karena pada pertandingan lawan benfica kami menempatkan gelandang esteban cambiasso sebagai bek tengah tapi dia melakukan pekerjaan dengan baik
4809474 seperti di pertandingan pertandingan lain lini tengah kami sangat solid dan bergerak dengan baik untuk membantu lini pertahanan selain itu zlatan ibrahimovic juga mulai bisa tampil selama 90 menit
4809475 utamanya setelah perjanjian damai ditandatangani para transmigran yang sebelumnya pulang ke daerah asal kembali lagi ke wilayah transmigrasi untuk mengusahakan lahannya yang telantar
4809476 ketika lahan itu diberdayakan kembali satwa liar merasa terganggu habitatnya dan mereka melihatnya sebagai gangguan
4809477 extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves
4809478 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4809479 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit
4809480 i liked our defense forcing the number of turnovers we did was the most satisfying for me
4809481 i was really proud of the way we came into the game focused from the beginning to the end and on both ends of the court
4809482 the key today was our defence and yao ming inside everyone needs a player like him hes a team leader
4809483 it was very difficult for us difficult psychologically but it was good to play at home as we knew we could not lose this game
4809484 i came here just to win and i did just that i didnt even know id broken the world record until i did my victory lap
4809485 now im just concentrating on my two races coming up i came here prepared and im going to try and do it the 100 and 200m double
4809486 im just happy i wanted to please myself and i did that
4809487 i didnt come here to set the world record because i am the holder i came here to win
4809488 i hope to win three gold medals the 200 plus the relay i am happy to make the country proud and to do it again for them in the 200m
4809489 the celebration it wasnt planned i was just celebrating i was pretty happy
4809490 i dont care about the rumours hes been tested over and over again
4809491 i say to them to come down come down and see our programme come down and see our testing and see how we operate come down anytime day or night we have nothing to hide
4809492 he is the best ever sprinter and ive said that before
4809493 he has run 9 69 and got the gold so he is definitely the greatest it was a spectacular performance and he was definitely the best here he could have run faster if he had run straight through the line
4809494 i was feeling good but i didnt feel it in my legs they died on me
4809495 it feels good to be here to be part of history
4809496 it was good to finish behind him bolt because theres no way anyone on earth could have beaten him tonight
4809497 to finish second to him that is a great accomplishment in itself usain is a great athlete it was just a matter of time before he proved himself on this stage
4809498 i cant be more satisfied with third place he bolt broke the world record you cant ask for more
4809499 everyone could see what he did he didnt even push through the line its an amazing time
4809500 at what dilution of cash to content can you no longer taste the sport in sport
4809501 gue pengen roger seenggaknya kasih pelukan buat dia bukannya menjauh
4809502 el endurecimiento de penas es un tema que debemos revisar y hacer una propuesta formal
4809503 debemos tomar junto a las estrategias que se est n manejando en materia de capacitaci n servicio civil de carrera mejores remuneraciones equipamiento tecnolog a y coordinaci n de los cuerpos policiales
4809504 se requiere actuar de manera coordinada eficaz con pol ticas p blicas homologables y sobre todo con un sistema de seguimiento y control sobre los cuerpos polic acos
4809505 es muy importante que la sociedad se exprese y si hay una enorme preocupaci n y repudio por el incremento de los secuestros y hechos tr gicos que hemos vivido es importante que la sociedad utilice esos canales que le garantiza la constituci n
4809506 i dont think so i think its about getting in touch with reality about balancing aspirations and actuality
4809507 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
4809508 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
4809509 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
4809510 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
4809511 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
4809512 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
4809513 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
4809514 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
4809515 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
4809516 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
4809517 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
4809518 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
4809519 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
4809520 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
4809521 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
4809522 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
4809523 no hemos jugado con la misma frescura con la que lo hicimos en los partidos anteriores
4809524 tenemos que actuar con m s agresividad tanto cuando ejercemos la defensa individual como colectiva sobre todo ante un rival de la potencia de estados unidos
4809525 el que debemos recuper nuestro mejor juego para llegar a los cuartos de final con el mejor nimo
4809526 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us
4809527 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down for another night out there so we got prepared to stick through another tough night
4809528 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm
4809529 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking oh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried
4809530 and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break
4809531 it was amazing yesterday morning to again hear the sound of a helicopter we heard it fly over the back of the ridge
4809532 as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again
4809533 we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up
4809534 finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility when it did finally see us everyone was just jumping up and down cheering
4809535 they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm
4809536 the security guard disallowed us to take photos in sch premise
4809537 they dont know what they want then they complain about what they get
4809538 having to grow up and fend for your goddamn self
4809539 we at johnson amp johnson have been making bath time a safe and soothing experience for far too long
4809540 years of pampering have left our newborns helpless feeble and ill equipped for the arduous road ahead
4809541 its time our children got the wake up call thats been coming to them
4809542 whether its your newborns more hardened appearance the way he now approaches people with guarded skepticism or just that look on his face that says oh wait maybe life isnt all hugs and kisses and rainbows
4809543 johnson amp johnson will kick your babys ass into gear
4809544 worried your child will never toughen up at johnson amp johnson we can help
4809545 my 13 month old used to be a total pushover
4809546 but ever since i started washing her hair with nothing but tears shampoo not only does my little debra kick and scream and wail but yesterday she said her first words no mommy dont
4809547 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4809548 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4809549 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4809550 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4809551 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4809552 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4809553 they examined the video and i think the case is closed
4809554 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4809555 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4809556 estoy entre las 16 mejores del mundo y eso es bueno para m
4809557 a n no s ahora quiero tomar unas vacaciones y luego ya sabremos qu hacer
4809558 el sue o de una revoluci n democr tica en la rep blica dominicana
4809559 la lucha por la construcci n de una revoluci n democr tica en el siglo xxi es y ser una lucha contra el hambre una lucha contra la pobreza una lucha contra la ignorancia una lucha contra la corrupci n y una lucha contra el crimen y las drogas
4809560 a ellos a quienes tanto apreciamos y valoramos les hacemos part cipes de todo este proceso de cambios y transformaciones por el que debe transitar la rep blica dominicana
4809561 los capos de la droga y el crimen escuchen bien porque aqu en la rep blica dominicana u00a1no pasar n

4809566 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4809567 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4809568 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4809569 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4809570 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4809571 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4809572 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4809573 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4809574 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4809575 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4809576 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4809577 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4809578 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4809625 la embajada de estados unidos se siente decepcionada por la decisi n que tom la ministra de seguridad p blica de actuar unilateralmente al conceder estatus de refugiada estamos muy preocupados por las implicaciones que esta decisi n tendr sobre las obligaciones de tratados internacionales para costa rica y en virtud de la cooperaci n bilateral judicial con estados unidos si bien respetamos el derecho soberano de cualquier naci n para tomar tales decisiones nos preocupa que esto pueda establecer un precedente muy perjudicial en conformidad con normas internacionales bien establecidas para casos futuros de extradici n ya sea con estados unidos o con otros pa ses en las pr ximas semanas continuaremos las conversaciones sobre este caso y sobre las implicaciones m s amplias de nuestras relaciones bilaterales y multilaterales con el gobierno de costa rica y estamos a la espera del fallo de la sala constitucional de costa rica en este caso particular

4809632 i liked our defense forcing the number of turnovers we did was the most satisfying for me
4809633 i was really proud of the way we came into the game focused from the beginning to the end and on both ends of the court
4809634 the key today was our defence and yao ming inside everyone needs a player like him hes a team leader
4809635 it was very difficult for us difficult psychologically but it was good to play at home as we knew we could not lose this game
4809636 in the land of the blind the man with one eye is king
4809637 during these humanitarian relief operations the united states expects russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open
4809638 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4809639 the expectation was that our two nations despite our differences shared areas of common interest where we could work together as real partners
4809640 has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4809641 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4809642 weve also canceled a u s canadian russian exercise vigilant eagle that was to have begun on aug 20
4809643 the trc public hearing is a very good exercise in history in accountability because it is bringing out testimonies that reflect on the actual events that led to other events up to this point it also gives the opportunity for us to analyze the beginning of our history to identify those factors that led to problems after many decades
4809644 first of all i didnt say that the whole thing was over power and greed everybody didnt fight because of power struggle we were making reference to the npfl and the political people who were in monrovia they started the first interaction we are not rebels we were a resistance movement rebels are those who revolt or fight constituted authorities we were refugees who had no choice but to come in to flush out the attacks by the npfl the purpose of our own operation was ensure that the various agreements signed between the afl armed forces of liberia and the npfl were adhered to
4809645 the key thing here is that this is not a prosecution unit acting like a cid criminal investigation division or police to try to put together charges this and that that may be included but the key here is reconciliation and one has to be careful to note also that if you invite people to come and tell nothing but the truth in other words they are confessing our constitution article 21 does not allow anyone to furnish criminal evidence against himself
4809646 generally the russian forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border
4809647 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4809648 over the last 24 hours really there has been no air activity
4809649 so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4809650 what we dont want to do is build some sort of mountain of supplies there with no distribution system

4809660 distribution is deficient there are absolutely no reserves they havent even done public bidding for health supplies imagine taking power aug 15 and finding no medications or diesel fuel it is a country that could go up in flames within two or three months this is why we say there is a kind of conspiracy to leave state institutions nonfunctioning

4809730 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
4809731 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
4809732 my daughter was very religious she was into the bible obsessed with it
4809733 they were going to show her the right way she got sucked into it
4809734 i fear for my grandsons and my daughters safety you see they are in a cult i havent seen or heard from my daughter since april
4809735 its a tragic tragic situation and we responded with the information that we had in a responsive way and unfortunately it didnt change the outcome
4809736 they were coaching her and telling her what to say
4809737 the disputed territories of south ossetia and abkhazia are georgian and that this is not something which is up for negotiation
4809738 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4809739 rain man looks retarded acts retarded not retarded autistic sure
4809740 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4809741 the russian tanks on the streets of georgian towns remind us of the invasion in 1968
4809742 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
4809743 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4809744 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4809745 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4809746 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence
4809747 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4809748 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable
4809749 i remember this square was covered with the orange flags of democracy

4809751 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4809752 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4809753 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4809754 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
4809755 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4809756 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few
4809757 im an educator not a wind expert or an investor
4809758 the great unknown which is how much the wind company is making
4809759 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
4809760 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
4809761 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4809762 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others

4809766 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs
4809767 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop
4809768 we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4809769 baa gatwick is disappointed to learn that the trade union representing some swissport employees has voted for strike action later this month
4809770 baa gatwick is working closely with the handling agent and the airlines it represents to minimise the potential impact on passengers planning to travel on the proposed strike dates
4809771 swissport believes that a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate and one that reflects the cost of living increase
4809772 one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport
4809773 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4809774 theres nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been
4809775 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4809776 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4809777 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4809778 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4809779 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done
4809780 i knew michael is a back half swimmer and that he would be chasing me down at the end
4809781 i saw his shadow on the side of my goggle and i knew he was coming i liked to be chased the last eight meters i just put my head down and i did not breathe
4809782 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4809783 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4809784 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4809785 i am sure bob bowman his coach and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4809786 people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race
4809787 if we got to do this again i would win it

4809814 theres an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the judiciary committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing
4809815 he is going down as the worst president ever the facts are in
4809816 but if there are 1000 people in england in one place how many of them are going to be racist realistically its going to be more than one if an idiot took that opportunity to act upon his ignorance then hes pathetic the branding of the whole festival as racist is pretty weak though
4809817 i wouldnt say there was a racial element to what most people were doing i really wouldnt
4809818 i know the history of download and that its really central to the metal scene that the fans are passionate and protective of their music
4809819 with maybe two exceptions in dizzee rascal and roots manuva black music is seen as being ignorant shallow and soulless
4809820 theres no infrastructure for grime or hip hop outside of a few radio stations that are barely listened to and a couple of tv channels that actually seem to go out of their way to make grime and hip hop look like the most ignorant pointless music in the world
4809821 when you are literally tailoring your music to specific sub divisions of radio broadcasters youre in trouble
4809822 how can the art be taken seriously when as an artist you have to bend over backwards fuck yourself twice and eat your own shit just to be heard by white audiences
4809823 in 2002 3 i tried my hand as a promoter and actually wanted to bring hip hop music to the indie kids in an indie world with an indie atmosphere
4809824 we had a venue ready to go in the west end we had acts on standby we had branding we had concepts we actually had partnership from the main hip hop magazine in britain and one of the key indie websites at the time but at the last minute the gig was pulled because a government letter went out to local councils who forwarded them on to local venue managers telling them not to promote any hip hop nights that summer
4809825 its funny how when you have punch ups at a rock gig they call it moshing but at a hip hop show its a riot
4809826 actual music fans in this country want lethal bizzle they want dizzee rascal they want roots manuva
4809827 if you offer dizzee to 6music listeners they react xfm and 6music are responsible for pushing roots manuva the streets and dizzee rascal into the space that theyre currently in but since then the creation of a black ghetto at the bbc and mtv has made it very very difficult to cross that boundary
4809828 dizzee was quite vocal around the release of his last album that he was struggling to reach the fans in this country that took to him on boy in da corner because he was being sectioned into a world that is way too small for his talent and his profile so when lethal bizzle tries to step out of his remit his ghetto he gets abuse to the extent that he got it at download festival
4809829 the word that keeps getting used with me is polarise 1xtra is the station for the blacks nothing really ever makes it off there on to the main station it boxes it all off man thats what polarises people
4809830 can a tinchy stryder single work next to a good shoes single absolutely
4809831 it does its what theyre playing in the indie clubs around the country but the system currently does not allow that to be possible on the mix shows perhaps zane lowe annie mac bobby friction mtv 2 maybe but when it comes down to it as a hip hop fan in britain i would not be hearing metal indie or anything with a guitar you simply would not hear it in your world as an indie fan im hearing very little hip hop music and as a metal fan im pretty much hearing none is that racist probably
4809832 thats fundamentally wrong you can look at radio 1s mainstream output and radio 1s specialist output we had police on my back by lethal bizzle on our b list play list last year and we added tynchy stryder yesterday weve had strong support for dizzee rascal for many years now
4809833 dizzee rascal right now is enjoying being on our a list
4809834 absolutely fundamentally not when 1xtra launched people were really worried that this was going to happen they thought that it would be an excuse for radio 1 not to play black music but its fundamentally not the case
4809835 as these measures of addition security are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4809836 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4809837 these questions are not decided by condoleezza rice or somebody else they are decided first of all by the side that has suffered in the conflict
4809838 what peacekeepers from what countries are needed for the people of south ossetia to feel comfortable is a primarily up to the people of south ossetia
4809839 he took black music to another level made it more classic
4809840 if loving you is wrong i dont want to be right
4809841 if you really want to know about the mind the spirit and life itself read scientology the fundamentals of thought it will put you on the right path
4809842 let me tell you something wax enthusiastic and youll feel so a being causes his own feelings its the joy of creating uh
4809843 what did you think about when matt and trey did that episode on scientology
4809844 one thing about matt and trey they lampoon everybody and if you take that serious ill sell you the brooklyn bridge for two dollars thats what they do
4809845 guys you have it all wrong were not like that i know thats your thing but get your information correct because somebody might believe that shit you know
4809846 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
4809847 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians muslims mormons or jews
4809848 we never heard a peep out of isaac in any way until we did scientology he wants a different standard for religions other than his own and to me that is where intolerance and bigotry begin
4809849 isaac hayes did not quit south park my sources say that someone quit it for him friends in memphis tell me that hayes did not issue any statements on his own about south park they are mystified

4809855 this is the first time this kind of plant being used to produce proteins that would be injected to the human body
4809856 this would become a way of curing cancer without side effects
4809857 every lymphoma patient had a target to their tumor cells but each tumor had different target on the patient
4809858 the substance will then be injected to the patients body

4809864 a major issue is russias contention that the region of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4809865 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4809866 georgias borders should command the same respect as every other nations theres no room for debate on this matter
4809867 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4809868 about the way russia has done this i think you will start to see reports come out about what russian forces engaged in
4809869 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4809870 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4809871 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4809872 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4809873 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4809874 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis

4809880 not an accurate reflection of the total experience of all patients
4809881 hse figures released to fine gael show that 14 903 operations were cancelled countrywide in 2007 the figures available for 2008 show there were 7 037 day case and in patient cancellations between january and 1st june this worryingly high figure indicates that the 2007 figures will be repeated or even exceeded leading to a situation where the more vulnerable are paying for the mismanagement by the government and the hse
4809882 cancelled operations have a real impact on patients by postponing important procedures prolonging pain and delaying investigations which may lead to early detection in the first five months of 2008 an average of 256 patients were left on trolleys in a amp es each day according to ino figures this alarming figure combined with the 7 000 cancelled operations shows the lack of capacity in the health services and continues to fuel bottlenecks which are hurting patients
4809883 the absence of long stay beds and community support for people who are currently in acute beds but need more appropriate rehabilitation convalescent or long term care adds to the problem freeing up existing hospital beds by providing these facilities and putting in new public beds as promised are two key infrastructure investments the fianna fail government failed to make during good economic times
4809884 now with brian cowans recession hitting essential services cutbacks leading to day ward closures and more cancellations are going to hit the ill and vulnerable of course as is always the case with this government it is patients and tax payers who continue to pay the price for hse incompetence
4809885 in ireland the number of cancellations is on a comparable basis with other hospital systems internationally the number of cancellations in our hospital system should be viewed in the context of overall activity
4809886 in 2007 the acute hospitals admitted over 574 000 day case patients and over 614 000 in patients in this context the total of 15 000 cancellations that occurred is relatively low 1 5 in addition the information as outlined in the the statement does not differentiate between surgical medical and day case cancellations or indicate the reason for the cancellation and cannot therefore be described as referring solely to operations
4809887 while some patients will have experienced surgical cancellations for example others will have experienced cancellation of day case procedures including a range of tests the monitoring system used to collate these cancellations records the total number of cancellations but not the associated reasons in a significant number of cases the cancellations will have occurred because the patient was not deemed clinically suitable for the procedure on the day by the relevant clinician

4809941 people who were highly anxious had raised wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4809942 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4809943 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4809944 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4809945 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress

4809957 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
4809958 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
4809959 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses
