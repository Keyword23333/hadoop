5790444 newborn babies are a huge responsibility and theres a lot more to it than waving your stylus and breathing into your ds you cant turn off a baby when you get bored you have to be realistic that its just a game but there is a legitimate concern for parents of teen girls that may get disillusioned into thinking that this is all there is to caring for an infant and in turn make some bad life decisions the same could be said for violence in video games unfortunately some kids just get easily caught up in cultures and fads and having a baby is not a fad its a life altering decision i havent seen or played the game but hopefully it deals with some obvious issues responsibly

5790452 that there have been several scientific papers published in peer reviewed scientific journals that suggest other possible explanations for the crop circle phenomenon than aliens or pranksters

5790492 following an initiative by georgian citizens who immigrated to israel and became businesspeople
5790493 the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli who is fluent in hebrew contributed to this cooperation
5790494 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
5790495 the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
5790496 and with his help israels defense industries managed to sell to georgia drones automatic turrets for armored vehicles antiaircraft systems communication systems shells and rockets

5790502 at this time the victim of this series of deceptions searching for bigfoot inc
5790503 due to this event peoples lives have been disrupted and many people so wanting vindication about their prior experiences were hurt let us all try to be mindful of such
5790504 i think it would be a benefit for the public to know when the committee is meeting and to be able to see the information as the committee meets that ultimately will be presented in a report

5790510 most students still job hunt with a shotgun rather than a rifle
5790511 in other words they apply to dozens and sometimes even hundreds of employers so they arent able to learn and market themselves well to their target organizations
5790512 we have a much more targeted reach since we do partner directly with the faculty and professors at the academic department and student group level
5790513 we actually power the job resource centers at the department and student associations a student utilizing their department web site can go to the job resource center and a link will take them to relevant jobs for their major

5790517 most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism
5790518 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism
5790519 the claims of georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for russias invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers and the continuing presence of russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region
5790520 russia must make good on president dmitry medvedevs commitment to immediately withdraw russian troops to their positions before the current fighting began
5790521 we also need a truly independent and international peacekeeping force in georgias conflict regions and we must help the people of georgia to rebuild their country and preserve its democratic institutions
5790522 this money will help the people of georgia recover from the damage that has been inflicted on their economy and send a clear message that the united states will not abandon this young democracy i hope this 1 billion commitment will be matched by others in the international community
5790523 i have long sought to help russia realize its extraordinary potential as a force for progress in the international community and have supported legislative efforts intended to forge a more constructive relationship with the kremlin but russias actions in georgia will have consequences
5790524 russias actions have already erased the possibility of advancing legislative efforts to promote u s russian partnership in the current congress including an agreement to allow for increased collaboration with russia on nuclear energy production and the repeal of the jackson vanik amendment which currently blocks the countrys integration into the world trade organization
5790525 russias failure to keep its word and withdraw troops from georgia risks the countrys standing as part of the international community that is not the future the united states or europe want but it is the future russia may get if it does not stand down its forces and live up to its commitments

5790536 i think there is some good competition behind casey dick
5790537 tyler wilson is looking really good and improving nathan dick had a pretty good day today there is good competition there and we have to let them keep fighting to see who comes out on top
5790538 it was a good plan but the intelligence wasnt that good
5790539 the hardest thing is to get them to work as a team

5790541 they like to argue but its a good thing were training them maybe it will pick up their confidence a little bit move us closer to pulling out

5790937 studies have consistently linked drinking alcohol to an increased risk of female breast cancer but until now there has been little data most of it conflicting about an independent role played by the choice of beverage type
5790938 people are notorious about self reporting if someone admits to 3 drinks per day theyre probably downing a lot more than that

5791042 i will use art in my math and science classes as a springboard for concepts and as a piece to stimulate the writing and critical thinking processes

5791059 ciliogenesis is a fundamental process these structures are found in almost every type of human cell you can imagine
5791060 if we can ever design drugs that will restore the formation and function of cilia even in the presence of cep290 mutations then that would be one way to cure the defects that lead to ciliary diseases

5791068 it came at 2 02 pm three quarters of an hour into a speech that kept the nation on tenterhooks president musharraf bowed to the inevitable and announced his resignation here at last was the moment the overwhelming majority of the countrys politicians had been hoping for
5791069 most will wonder why it took the president so long some will rue the lost opportunity to impeach him what is incontestable is that the country must move on from this crisis quickly
5791070 so far in his interrogation he has confessed to his involvement in the ahmedabad blasts
5791071 though bashir is cooperating in interrogation he is not revealing much details he is just giving short replies to the questions asked by the officials most of his replies are in yes and no
5791072 no there is no deal and the former president resigned on his own
5791073 the leaders of the coalition parties are meeting to discuss important issues including the restoration of deposed judges election of the next president and the accountability of the former president
5791074 i had given my suggestions on the issue to those concerned
5791075 obviously its a fragile situation in pakistan because its a new civilian government for the first time in a long time in pakistan since 1999 but it is an elected government i think it has fabulous support and thats a lot to build on
5791076 i dont subscribe to the notion that theres no leadership in pakistan theres a democratically elected prime minister theres a government that came into being as a coalition and its had its difficulties internally
5791077 musharraf has made the right decision to step down as president of pakistan it is in the interests of the pakistani people to end the political crisis that has immobilised the coalition government for too long
5791078 i had advocated the us move from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy the opportunity created by musharrafs exit must be utilised to focus on issues like terrorism food and energy shortages and to help people there build a stable secure and democratic future
5791079 us policy must focus on assuring that all elements of pakistans government are resolute in shutting down the safe havens for al qaeda and the taliban there can be no safe haven for terrorists who threaten the american people

5791085 no decision has been made about the teams yet but we are very keen to go and be one of the clubs involved in the first afl match played over there
5791086 its a great opportunity there are growing cultural and population ties between india and australia the tigers being a revered animal in that country would be a perfect fit for the indian market

5791091 the international law is 100 on the side of cyprus that is why turkey refused to go to court

5791123 the congress spokesperson said on monday that the amarnath sangarsh samiti is the other side of hurriyat we strongly condemn it it is a highly irresponsible statement
5791124 we would like to ask the congress the basis of this perceptional equality
5791125 the hurriyat talks openly of freedom many of their supporters hoist the pakistani flag on aug 15 and many speak the language of isi and play into their hands

5791141 this is so devastating for me the gold would have been mine if it werent for a hamstring grab i was in control for half of the race by the 320 metre mark i felt my right hamstring i pulled my leg through and it got tighter and tighter
5791142 it is the top of my career the experience is so great i cant believe it i lost one of my best throws because there were some delays it was during the womens 400m final and i had to take a break i lost my concentration

5791152 even yesterday on monday akhil could have won his bout but for not getting any points initially even if he had got one or two punches through the defence the tempo of the bout would have been totally different

5791157 i could see him slowing down and i was still pumping to the line
5791158 hes a phenomenal athlete and i dont think theres any way anyone could have beaten him
5791159 a lot of people are of the belief that you have to be short strong and stocky to be a great sprinter and usain bolt has defied that he has shown that hes a 6ft 5in sprinter and can run well and break world records he has great starts and its the beginning of something else
5791160 i am definitely not going to say hes the epitome of the sprinter because there is too many different kinds of sprinters that ive admired over the years but the way he drives and his pattern the way it goes together his amazing first 40 metres i give it to him
5791161 i woke up around eleven i watched television and then i had some chicken nuggets for lunch i went back to my room i slept for two hours i went back for some more nuggets and came to the track

5791244 we were screwing around with the gas tank bass and i was trying to figure out the banjo
5791245 a 70s grand marquis or ltd is the best we can figure
5791246 we got to new york and did some busking in manhattan
5791247 and it was like we werent playing the same songs so it was a big happy accident really

5791251 the hurdles to democracy that the two parties put out in front of you are so onerous that third parties are learning to cooperate
5791252 you ought to be able to have support in the state youre running in if you are going to have a real candidacy
5791253 you ought to have people in the state willing to go out and get petition signatures
5791254 not everyone can just go out and petition some people are too shy the two major parties will create all kinds of barriers to full participation in the political process
5791255 first it is next to impossible for to run a petition drive in the public with out even the slightest news coverage to let people know you are petitioning for a candidate
5791256 even the most obscure democrat and republicans had some coverage in the primaries and news links on news websites
5791257 second 31 states have lower petition requirements than ct and some states like louisiana and colorado have no signatures requirements at all ballot access news org when the petitions that were submitted early were getting a very high 65 rejection rate for signatures by partisan democrat and republican voter registrars the required 7 500 valid signatures mean submitting at least twice or three times that number and on 169 different forms one each for each small town in ct even with 30 people working on this drive we could not make the high number or challenge why so many signatures were deemed invalid at each of the 169 town halls
5791258 third because of the quirky ct ballot laws greens had to have

5791261 i was bitten by the radio bug while in college at columbia
5791262 when i left school i got a job in the radio networks at nbc but found out quickly that there were several layers of bureaucracy between me and programming i wanted to play my hillbilly records and talk about music history they wanted to run commentator paul harvey
5791263 being exposed to old records and new music too led to my singing and learning how to play the guitar
5791264 my favorite record of the last 10 years and possibly my life
5791265 i went all around the world a few years ago trying to get the word out about my last album
5791266 i stayed out as long as i could when i came back home it suddenly felt like id be stuck forever between the four walls of my new york apartment many mothers go through this the overwhelming sense of needing to stay right here so the album came out of missing the movement id become accustomed to
5791267 the way they run the brewery is all on wind power and its very ecologically sound also in the end its delicious tasting beer
5791268 on the last record it felt like it was a move towards more instrumentation without being too weighty
5791269 were still being relatively light but i think the next album will probably be even more stripped down im not sure yet were still in the writing kind of stage so well see where it goes but id like to keep it with a fuller sounding band for sure
5791270 i feel like im coming in a bit more from an angle thats equal parts of indie rock and indie folk
5791271 its using those old tools the bluegrass mindset or the traditional folk mindset but kind of doing something new when using those old tools so i think were approaching it in a very knowledgeable way i guess with a respect for that tradition but not necessarily being strictly traditional or old time y i feel like im not really conscious of trying to fit in anywhere or into a certain expectation or label
5791272 the only thing ive got going for me is perfect blood pressure
5791273 i basically see it as what ive become is two 30 year olds who stand around and discuss my problems its a much easier way to deal with it
5791274 they just would sit out there until i got good at it they were in a panic
5791275 every asshole in america is going to be there and were the first group
5791276 as far as im concerned if you really believe in what you believe in and youre really so certain about it then
5791277 i understand the necessity of taking moral stands et cetera but i dont understand the necessity of you know somehow if i dont believe in it it diminishes you somehow you feel the need to make sure that i believe in what you believe well then how much do you believe in it
5791278 but if you start with the mindset that youre entering the day with the fact that somebodys going to attack you chances are youre asking for it you know im not being oprah but when you start with that mentality you generate that mentality around you
5791279 its why you have police when you have cops and theyre all over the country telling you that certain things have to be changed to keep them out of danger and you dont pay attention to what your police are saying it goes for everything
5791280 you didnt pay attention to what your generals said you dont pay attention to you know what lets forget it what do we need government for just run around and then wonder where your clean water is going to come from asshole

5791310 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5791311 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5791312 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5791313 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5791314 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5791315 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team

5791326 i wouldnt predict a huge increase this year though the recent increases in interest rates may put the squeeze on unsecured borrowing
5791327 all creditors are worried about people dumping debt without them being in genuine financial hardship
5791328 citizens advice bureaux dealt with 1 4 million debt problems in the last financial year
5791329 there are thousands of people who have substantial debt and will never be able to pay it off
5791330 up until then i had always tried to have it all a career a family and my own business many women within my own community have none of these things the attitude is still that women are meant to stay at home
5791331 i was overcommitted but anyone who starts a business knows that in the first five years of being in business that is the way things go what is the alternative though should you never risk anything
5791332 its not as if i was spending the money on shoes or holidays i used it to invest in a business before i took on that debt the buy to let property was paying for itself
5791333 one of the most difficult things i found was facing up to people in my own community i wanted to be an example and here i was in trouble
5791334 as soon as i knew i would have difficulty i contacted them to explain that i had a short term cash flow crisis and as soon as i could work again it was nigh on impossible to get a new contract when heavily pregnant payments would resume
5791335 in nearly all circumstances i found i came up against a brick wall you would talk to one person they would agree something and then the next time you would speak to someone else and have to start all over
5791336 i wanted to explore what systems lenders have in place they always say talk to us if youre having problems well i tested that
5791337 what i found was far worse than i was expecting
5791338 no one could make decisions and it seemed that as soon as they heard you had difficulties they tried to scare money out of you rather than think how can we approach this customer so that they keep their head above water and we get our money
5791339 a lot of people bundled in having a child with a fancy car or holiday a type of self indulgence rather than a necessity for society
5791340 i am pretty self reliant growing up i faced racial abuse and insults i can handle myself
5791341 i found it very creepy though there were some cruel comments after i wrote that my father had died and then i had someone post on a message board some personal details they had found through companies house
5791342 i face having this debt hang over me for the next decade
5791343 the chief lesson is that debt means a loss of independence it is necessary to borrow if you want to invest but if things go wrong then you are very much on your own
5791344 as things stand i cant take time out of work to be with my child or to have another baby
5791345 i am in a quandary should i ever take financial risk again with the chances that i may suffer a change of circumstances that my average male counterpart would not
5791346 we need swifter action to protect consumers this lengthy process since our 2005 super complaint is doing little to protect people from ppi rip offs in the meantime

5791350 pursuing third parties for payment when they are not liable
5791351 sending demands for payment to an individual when it is uncertain that they are the debtor in question
5791352 requiring an individual to supply information to prove they are not the debtor
5791353 bankruptcy will be less punishing a sweeter option as a result of these changes
5791354 the idea is to move us to an american system where bankruptcy is not stigmatised and where risk taking is encouraged
5791355 but at the end of the day someone has to pick up the bill for business and personal failure
5791356 where bankrupts can make a contribution they will pay this is not an easy ride
5791357 i dont anticipate that as a result of these reforms we will see bankruptcies rise
5791358 last year only 900 out of 26 500 bankrupts listed the student loan company as a creditor the national union of students has said that bankruptcy is not a free lunch and can prejudice employment prospects
5791359 the monthly figures clearly show the cumulative effects of the gradual worsening in affordability for first time buyers and the ever rising proportion of them who are caught by stamp duty
5791360 the combination of people experiencing increases in fuel bills and rising housing costs puts additional pressure on peoples finances which were already stretched to the limit
5791361 work individually with customers by allowing some short term concessions within agreed parameters to assist customers who are facing financial difficulties
5791362 we are acting on information held either by barclaycard or a credit reference agency which suggest customers may be experiencing financial difficulty
5791363 by taking this action barclaycard aims to help prevent customers from getting into deeper financial problems
5791364 its nice to know they are actually doing what they say they are doing
5791365 putting pressure on debtors or third parties is considered to be oppressive
5791366 in law a contract is a contract and if you have signed it then you are bound by it
5791367 treat all cases of financial difficulty sympathetically and we would urge anyone experiencing problems to contact us at the earliest opportunity

5791373 there is the great and continuing challenge represented by the threat to democracy in fiji
5791374 it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries
5791375 i will be compelled to tell the people of my country that they must now be prepared to suffer more sanctions and international isolation as we pursue a better more durable democracy

5791379 theres been a suggestion that theyve been in the vicinity on and off for a couple of weeks but certainly no ones been seen sleeping in the bin or actually living in it
5791380 when police investigated they found a few bedding items and living items its a bit hard to draw a conclusion
5791381 the widening credit quality spreads in the money and bond markets is certainly unsettling
5791382 the market has handled bad news well for the past few weeks which could indicate that investors are beginning to look out into the future
5791383 for now though traders are back to the present and worried about the here and now we could get a test of the recent lows over the next few weeks
5791384 the us indicators today carry a strong flavour of stagflation
5791385 the son of god reflects on his mother the glory the majesty the power of regality which springs from being associated with him hence the church acclaims her queen of heaven

5791388 there are huge challenges domestically and its the same old issues

5791396 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
5791397 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
5791398 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
5791399 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
5791400 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
5791401 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
5791402 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
5791403 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
5791404 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that
5791405 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist its what everyone dreams of
5791406 i hit the floor and i looked at mark and said can you believe that just happened
5791407 i have with great sadness learnt of the passing on of a good friend and comrade
5791408 as an individual and as a party we have always hoped and prayed for his speedy recovery sadly he has left us at this most trying time
5791409 sadc cannot stand by and do nothing when one of its members is experiencing political and economic pain
5791410 his passing on is a sad day to the zimbabwe people who at this stage are yearning for a new beginning which can unquestionably be characterised as democratic and a reflection of the will of the people

5791413 we see dispersed storage as an ideal technology for cloud storage or storage as a service because the systems can scale infinitely
5791414 you can simultaneously lose some pieces of the network and still put the data back
5791415 you can lose multiple servers multiple locations and still not lose the content
5791416 this is just the origin of a network that is going to grow
5791417 were in discussions with people on the west coast and the east coast so it will be in all parts of the u s
5791418 if youre going to store multiple peoples data in one storage system theres a certain amount of trust that a service provider has to provide but with dsnet the data that is stored is not the original data
5791419 each individual slice does not make any sense on its own therefore the data that is stored by the service provider is virtually unrecognizable
5791420 the medias representation of what is good or cool because those who inhabit the media world of glamour and entertainment and fashion and gossip are horrid people who have no talent of any kind and yet think of themselves as tastemakers

5791427 sons i have sinned against your father i would not go with him and i have robbed you of everlasting life
5791428 what shall we do with this woman if she continues this we will lose her as surely as we lost her husband
5791429 peace be to this house do you know why i come my name is secret i dwell with those on high they tell me you are now aware of your sin the merciful one has sent me t tell you that he is a god ready to forgive and that he takes delight the more pardons he gives here is a letter for you from the king
5791430 i want you to come as your husband did on the way to the celestial city and dwell in my presence with joy forever
5791431 wont you carry me and the boys with you so that we may worship the king
5791432 go to the wicket gate over beyond the plain for that is the entrance to the way keep the letter with you you must deliver it at the celestial gate
5791433 let us puck and to to the celestial city to live with your father in peace
5791434 the bitter comes before the sweet even sweeter please leave you did not come here in gods name
5791435 since this is christianas farewell i will walk a little way with her
5791436 i suspect you are thinking of going wit her well take heed we are out of danger here in the city of destruction i cant wait to talk to mrs mrs inconsiderate mrs light mind and mrs know nothing they know im right
5791437 cast your lot with us mercy for i am sure not all the gold in spain could make my husband sorry he is there in the place you wont be rejected
5791438 go with me to the wicket gate see if you are allowed to enter
5791439 my poor relatives remain in our sinful town and there is no one to encourage them to come
5791440 we want to be admitted through this gate t the way that leads to the celestial city i am christiana the wife of christian
5791441 are you now a pilgrim who once despised that life
5791442 if there is any grace and forgiveness of sins to spare please let me in too
5791443 i take all who believe i to me by whatever means they come to me
5791444 why do you keep such a cruel dog as mercy still shaken
5791445 he belongs to beelzebub to frighten pilgrims from the way
5791446 murder murder for she was sure they were fiends after body and soul
5791447 i marveled when you came in the gate that you did not ask our lord for a protector said the man
5791448 i was warned in a dream these two fiends would try to prevent my salvation
5791449 we understand this is a privileged place for pilgrims i am christiana the wife of christian who some time ago traveled this way
5791450 come in daughter of abraham come boys come maiden mercy
5791451 is this the figure of the man of the world
5791452 the rake is his carnal mind he is so intent on raking straw and dust and sticks he doesnt see god
5791453 this shows how the ugliest creatures full of the venom of sin belong in the kings house god had made nothing in vain
5791454 and that price was the blood of your lord who came and stood in your place
5791455 my heart is ten times lighter and more joyous now
5791456 yet it makes my heart ache to thin he bled for me
5791457 thy are simple sloth and presumption they had no intention to be pilgrims but only to hinder the pilgrims who passed by they turned several out of the way slow pace short wind no heart linger after lust sleepy head dull
5791458 the evil thirst put it in a vessel and let the dirt settle it will be pure again
5791459 the way of the sluggard is blocked but the path of the upright is a highway
5791460 these are pilgrims and this is the way they must go
5791461 i am grim some call be bloody man this is no longer the way
5791462 you should have asked him to let me go all the way with you he would have granted request good bye
5791463 that i should ever follow my husband much less worship the lord with him
5791464 forgetful green here is the most dangerous place in all these parts
5791465 this is where pilgrims have trouble if the forget favor they have received and how unworthy they are this is where christina fought apollyon christinas blood is on the stones to this day look there are apollyons broken arrows when apollyon was beaten he retreated into the next valley which is called the valley of death
5791466 but no one can know what is means until they come into it themselves
5791467 i am a guide for these pilgrims to the celestial cit
5791468 i beg your pardon i was afraid you were of those who robbed little faith some time ago
5791469 and what could you have done if we had been of that company puzzles great heart
5791470 why i would have fought so hard im sure you couldnt have given me the best of it no christian can be overcome unless he gives up himself
5791471 my name is honest i only wish that was my nature
5791472 i have heard of your husband his name rings all over these parts of the world for his faith his courage hi endurance and his sincerity
5791473 what could be the reason that such a good man should be so much in the dark
5791474 the wise god will have it so some must pipe and some must weep though the notes of the bass are woeful some say it is the ground of music
5791475 a small wound proof of my love to my master and a means by grace of increasing my final reward
5791476 it is my duty to distrust my own ability so i may rely on he who is stronger that all
5791477 i thought i would live for i heard that any pilgrim if he keeps his heart pure toward the lord will not die by the hand of the enemy
5791478 you are all lusty and strong i will be a burden
5791479 i am committed to comfort the feeble minded and to support the weak
5791480 i have a commandment to fight the good fight of faith and who is a greater enemy of faith than the giant despair
5791481 great heart one of the kings protectors for pilgrims to the celestial city prepare yourself for battle
5791482 i as set upon the three men wild head inconsiderate and pragmatic they gave me three choices become one of them go back on the way or die i fought them for house they fled when they heard you coming
5791483 though an army besiege me my heart will not fear
5791484 he is standfast a right good pilgrim what happened standfast
5791485 a woman of great beauty came to be she spoke soothingly and smiled at the end of every sentence she offered me her body her purse and her bed i am very lonely i am very poor and i am very weary but i turned her down several times and yet she persisted if only i would let her rule me she said she would make me so happy she said she is the mistress of the world madam bubble i fell to my knees as you see me now and prayed to him above who cold help me she only just left me
5791486 here is a true israelite in whom there is nothing false i wish you a fair day and a dry river when you set out for the celestial city but as for me come wet or dry i long to go
5791487 i come lord to be with you and bless you
5791488 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5791489 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5791490 we have all got concerns i have got a pakistani background and i do know what karachi can be like having grown up there
5791491 it is possible that you could postpone it is possible that you could relocate it is possible that you could add in a ninth and tenth team
5791492 we have already made many improvements to mobileme but we still have many more to make
5791493 to recognize our users patience we are giving every mobileme subscriber as of today a free 60 day extension this is in addition to the one month extension most subscribers have already received
5791494 the transition from mac to mobileme was rockier than we had hoped
5791495 while we are making a lot of improvements the mobileme service is still not up to our standards
5791496 we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour and we truly appreciate your patience as we turn this around
5791497 having been constructively critical of the problems i should say this a welcome extension and acknowledgement of some of the problems

5791549 welcome harve it is good to finally have someone who can fix the gates
5791550 aggressive capacity expansion by mini mills globally from turkey to russia and to south korea will push scrap prices higher and that means they will be exposed to great risks
5791551 theyll be able to pass on higher material costs but when economies slow it will be small mills rather than bigger blast furnaces who will be dealt a bigger blow
5791552 mini mills are likely to increase their scrap purchases from such markets as asia is in short supply of recyclable metals due to strong steel demand and aggressive capacity expansion
5791553 cost increases are something we are ready to accept because it is more important to diversify supply sources and secure stable contract deals when market conditions are so tight
5791554 such factors are likely to continue to bolster scrap prices though they came off their record highs this month due to seasonal factors

5791622 the narrowness of the bridge was a concern especially with a raised walkway but they really need more walking space there
5791623 the letter said the second option was the safest in light of potential costs
5791624 that option gives the 5 foot raised sidewalk two 10 inch shoulders and each lane is 10 feet wide
5791625 were trying to balance the safety of walkers and people riding bicycles as well as auto travelers we also considered plowing in the winter with a raised sidewalk were back to the 21 foot 8 inch bridge curb to curb with a 12 foot blade the blade would be over the center line if the path is not raised the plow could use it
5791626 the 5 foot un raised sidewalk eliminates the shoulder and therefore is not legal with the americans with disabilities act requirements
5791627 the walkway and shoulder and ada lane can be one and the same
5791628 as long as theres a 5 foot pathway it meets ada requirements whether its raised or not
5791629 i feel a raised sidewalk is much safer than a painted line in the road

5791635 its become the largest producer of natural gas in the unites states
5791636 our forecasts focus list contains only two energy stocks both of which are in the oil services sector oceeaneering international and transocean
5791637 while stocks in this group tend to move with oil prices in the near term their pro ts depend more on exploration spending than on commodity prices
5791638 concerns about slowing demand for crude oil and re ned products both in the u s and overseas have many investors worried but investors in the equipment and services group should not panic
5791639 most producers continue to spend aggressively and u s crude oil inventories remain well below the average for this time of year with fewer than 20 days of supply in storage
5791640 demand for offshore drilling services remains strong giving transocean excellent growth potential consensus estimates project per share pro ts will rise 69 in 2008 and 15 in 2009 transocean the worlds largest offshore drilling contractor operates in every major drilling region
5791641 a combination of tight global rig supplies and the ongoing discovery of new offshore reserves have driven rig lease rates higher and kept transoceans eet busy the companys largest most expensive rigs are 95 sold out for 2009 and the backlog is growing
5791642 oceaneering international has fallen 28 since the end of june re ecting a drop in petroleum prices and somewhat disappointing guidance for the second half of 2008 the pullback represents a buying opportunity as the stock seems cheap considering oceaneerings pro t outlook
5791643 oceaneering makes its money by selling equipment and providing services to drillers a business that should remain lucrative as long as drilling demand remains strong exploration activity is likely to remain robust even if per barrel oil prices fall to the 80 to 100 range
5791644 given the large number of offshore wells now being drilled 300 plus in 2008 with even more to come demand for oceaneerings products should pick up
5791645 in addition todays deeper wells will require longer umbilicals the tubes used to pump oil robust demand for remotely operated vehicles rovs is driving rental rates up oceaneerings 214 vessels represent the worlds largest rov eet
5791646 company guidance looks conservative and we expect oceaneering to exceed wall street expectations over the next year

5791674 everyday of inaction on energy policy we are paying our enemies to do really bad things we know hugo chevez is seeking to buy for venezuela 50 su 27 fulcrum attack jets 20 mi 29 attack helicopters and to arm 128 000 soldiers with ak 47 assault rifles and were giving him 150 million dollars a day we must do better

5791677 the rising cost of fuel has led to a reduction in benefits that small businesses can provide to their employees and something is seriously wrong when a small business has to spend more on fuel than on its own employees
5791678 it has been twenty five years since a refinery was built in the united states we take oil out of the ground in the united states and ship it to other countries to be refined because we cant build new refineries in this country those are good american jobs that we could have but are prevented by bureaucratic red tape and a democrat congress
5791679 it is refreshing to see that president bush has finally recognized that strengthening automobile fuel economy standards is the best thing our nation could do to help reduce our demand for imported oil and our nations resulting vulnerability to volatility in the international oil market it is also encouraging to hear the president finally begin to acknowledge that human activities are causing global warming
5791680 the president is correct in suggesting that a mandatory fuel standard is needed to respond to both the threat posed by our nations growing dependence on imported oil and the looming catastrophe of global warming
5791681 in contrast to the presidents bill the bipartisan legislation that rep platts r pa and i have introduced would require a mandatory 4 increase in motor vehicle fuel economy standards over the next decade followed by subsequent increases thereafter i encourage the administration to drop its opposition to our legislation

5791694 there is no longer a case for taking 4 billion a year from the public to produce programmes they do not want or can obtain free elsewhere
5791695 the world has moved on since the days when the bbc was central to british life any modern government that fails to acknowledge this fact is quite simply defying the will of the people
5791696 corporate gigantism and belief in a unique moral mission have made the bbc what it is today and yet both are of vanishingly small concern to viewers and listeners
5791697 the bbc internally is not neutral about multiculturalism it believes in it and promotes diversity lets face up to that
5791698 it must seek respect not for what it is but for what it does
5791699 the bbcs remit is to produce a volume of high quality programmes with much reduced output its long tradition of producing fine programmes and a budget of 4 million a day it should be able to achieve it triumphantly
5791700 the english democrats are offering a fresh start and reject the clich ridden and spin politics of the past we offer the politics of a common national identity and common values our politics are riddled with spin and political correctness a vote for the english democrats is a vote for honest and plain speaking
5791701 there should be an immediate referendum on the eu lisbon treaty it is wholly wrong for labour to try to impose this treaty on us contrary to their own specific manifesto commitment that there should be a referendum the people of the republic of ireland have said no we want our say
5791702 there should be free residential car for the elderly as is available in scotland it is wrong that pensioners homes in england are being seized to pay for this
5791703 we also demand access to all nhs drugs not a
5791704 there should be an end to the unjustified subsidies to other parts of the uk we want a fair system for all
5791705 england can no longer sustain uncontrolled mass immigration it should be stopped it places an unacceptable strain on all our services all previous governments have allowed this situation to get out of control
5791706 the government should seek to protect society and not the criminals
5791707 there should be an english parliament with an english prime minister and government with at least the same powers as the scottish ones
5791708 the voters of haltemprice and howden have the chance to send a clear message to the government and the rest of the stale political establishment that the people of england are no longer prepared to be treated as second class citizens within the uk let us put englands interests first
5791709 i am convinced that standing still is not an option the present arrangements are producing growing resentment all over the united kingdom particularly in england
5791710 a vote for joanne and the english democrats is a positive vote for the people of haltemprice and howden it is a vote for england and for an english parliament first minister and government for england
5791711 i will impress upon them the need to avoid prejudicing the process which we must now undertake in ireland
5791712 accord us the time we need to play our part in understanding last weeks vote
5791713 one of the main goals will be to calm the europeans down and not inflame the situation either in the eu or back at home any further
5791714 it will be made clear to the eu partners that it is politically impossible for ireland to have a rerun
5791715 i think you have excellently designed institutions for the budget process in an independent state or a state with substantial fiscal autonomy
5791716 barnett is unsustainable in the long run it is neither efficient nor equitable
5791717 it gives perverse incentives to the devolved administrations their block grant is a function of a number they cannot control
5791718 in turn their decisions have consequences which the uk government cannot fully control
5791719 it probably derives not from greater need but from the more credible threat to the union of the united kingdom that they pose
5791720 prof mcleans evidence points to one of devolutions fundamental flaws that we are spending money without direct responsibility for raising it
5791721 it is time to look again at how we fund our policy priorities
5791722 we may have to say well look were not happy with this situation here are some of the powers wed like to have back but we cant give you that referendum on the lisbon treaty because its already been put in place across the rest of europe
5791723 mutterings about regime change used to be confined to the fringes of the party but now there is a more widespread view that gordon will have to go unless he can win back public support
5791724 tamsin delivers for crewe and nantwich you told tamsin your concerns she put them directly to the chancellor she stood up for you
5791725 i think you will find he is not the type of lawyer he claims to be
5791726 it would not surprise us if labour was stooping to this level its entire campaign has been marked by mean spirited stunts and dirty tricks
5791727 carter tells anyone who will listen that james is the best thing since sliced bread
5791728 one way of unseating him would be through a war of attrition with relentless carefully placed attacks laying the ground for a delegation of elder statesmen the men in suits
5791729 asked what he would be in another life it would be a salesman car dealer pr guy estate agent and worst of all a foxtons estate agent
5791730 government in the uk is now so large diverse and complex that it is impossible for anyone to manage effectively let alone by ministers with no prior experience of management and little in depth understanding of the work carried out by their departments government today tries to do too much and consequently fails the structure of government needs to change if we hope to see better value and significant improvements in our public services
5791731 do you think that regeneration is adding a new wing to your mansion
5791732 have you and your tory mates on the council been soft on yobs and failed to make our streets safer
5791733 flatters some of the most chauvinistic and backward looking parts of british society
5791734 is a small price to pay for saving the union
5791735 we are worried about the reports of ken drinking too much if we lost london it would be a political disaster and gordon knows that
5791736 in my view ken livingstone would do a better job if he drank less i fear we have an alcohol fuelled mayoralty
5791737 well im concerned about the amount im drinking because its nothing like enough
5791738 the english are awakening to the unfairness of the barnett formula and to the democratic deficit in the way in which we are governed
5791739 come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue if england to itself do rest but true
5791740 look if england got its own parliament and the union broke up what would happen to all the scottish people living in england and all the english people living in scotland
5791741 the truth the whole truth and anything but the truth
5791742 in some of the more heavily populated urban areas of the country family life is quite frankly in meltdown or completely unrecognisable
5791743 in some areas of the country even including the more urban parts of the sleepy west in which i operate family life in the old sense no longer exists
5791744 so i suggest the general collapse of ordinary family life because of the breakdown of families in this country is on a scale depth and breadth which few of us could have imagined even a decade ago
5791745 what is certain is that almost all of societys social ills can be traced directly to the collapse of the family life
5791746 most children and young people in england today are safe healthy and achieve well
5791747 the new brownvilles will be the same old projects that developers have been trying to squeeze through planning for ages greenwashed to suit the zeitgeist commuter dormitories with low energy knobs on
5791748 immigration is responsible for at least 70 per cent of the uks projected population increase which will take the uk from 61 million today to 85 million by 2081
5791749 the environmental consequences of such a massive population rise are alarming they include loss of countryside and green space and all the psychological stresses that come with high population densities overcrowding and loss of tranquillity
5791750 the alternative vote has many attractions including the fact that you have to get 50 plus one in that constituency therefore you have a greater legitimacy
5791751 it should not be about parties choosing a system that will most advantage themselves its about a voting system that delivers democracy for all of us
5791752 i dont understand how it can cause offence it is our country after all
5791753 home office policy precludes applications with tattoos on lower arm hand face or neck that are prominent which may cause offence and or invite provocation from the public or colleagues
5791754 a family who arent of english origin who see england on your arm could feel you might discriminate against them
5791755 we live in a diverse society and try to ensure we give everybody equality
5791756 but im now looking at other options like the fire service or prison service
5791757 this tattoo was clearly visible as it does not meet our rigorous standards his application was rejected
5791758 i expect they will want to ensure that the same type of collateral for central bank loans is taken here as it is by the fed and european central bank
5791759 i think the issue here is much more about ensuring that as peaks and troughs hit central banks are prepared to act and provide liquidity if liquidity is required
5791760 the bank of england is very keen to ensure that we have good strong confidence in our market after all weve got good strong banks
5791761 make it clearer what it means to be a citizen
5791762 practical measures that may help enhance a sense of shared belonging
5791763 my report makes a range of proposals that touch every stage of an individuals life my proposals are intended to promote the meaning and significance of citizenship within modern britain
5791764 in terms of a british national day what may be beneficial is a new public holiday to celebration the bond of shared citizenship
5791765 it can be a pledge of commitment to the country it can be a statement of what the rights and responsibilities of citizens are
5791766 we already teach schoolchildren what citizenship means but it would make sense to have a coming of age ceremony which marks the moment they move from being a student of citizenship to being a real citizen in themselves
5791767 a half baked idea that should be left to go mouldy
5791768 i see this as an empty gesture to ask 16 year olds to troop into a hall and like americans put their hands on their heart and take an oath of allegiance is risible

5791810 from the beginning of third day we realized that we needed to have someone to speak into our lives as individuals and as a band through the years we have had many people pastors and friends travel with us but of all those people nigel james has been the most important he has allowed us and reminded us to be men of god first and as a result our music and ministry have reflected that nigel has kept us accountable to each other to the church and of course to our lord he has helped us to grow in our faith and has reminded us to stay focused on our calling and on what third day is really all about
5791811 how did you get the job of third days road pastor

5791845 the main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between u s and georgian forces
5791846 the georgian move against south ossetia was motivated by political considerations having to do with israel and iran according to nfc georgian president mikheil saakashvili decided to assert control over the breakaway region in order to force israel to reconsider its decision to cut back its support for georgias military
5791847 russian and georgian media reported several days ago that israel decided to stop its support for georgia after moscow made it clear to jerusalem and washington that russia would respond to continued aid for georgia by selling advanced anti aircraft systems to syria and iran

5791854 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0 the gtalkservice will provide connectivity to googles servers for google talk instant messaging but the api has been removed from this release while we improve the service note that this will be a google specific service and is not part of the core of android

5791984 his hands legs were amputated and his head was decapitated
5791985 there are the bloodstains on the wall and here it is dried on the floor
5791986 and here a womans shoes she was a victim of the militia we found her corpse in the grave
5791987 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5791988 spies you will dig your own graves long live the mehdi army
5791989 we found this chain on an old mans corpse that we dug out of the grave
5791990 we recovered his corpse completely rotten his hands and legs were amputated and his head was decapitated
5791991 their families are in the district the day before yesterday at noon they tried to assassinate me but i was able to call the police for help
5791992 they said they were just taking him for a few minutes for an investigation
5791993 but they never released him and we heard he might be buried behind the mosque
5791994 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
5791995 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
5791996 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
5791997 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
5791998 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
5791999 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
5792000 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
5792001 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
5792002 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
5792003 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
5792004 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
5792005 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
5792006 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new
5792007 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5792008 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5792009 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5792010 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5792011 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5792012 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5792013 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5792014 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5792015 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5792016 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5792017 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5792018 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5792019 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5792020 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5792021 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5792022 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5792023 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5792024 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5792025 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5792026 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5792027 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5792028 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5792029 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5792030 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5792031 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5792032 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5792033 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5792034 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5792035 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5792036 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5792037 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5792038 we have noticed an increase in displaced individuals and families
5792039 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5792040 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5792041 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5792042 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5792043 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5792044 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5792045 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5792046 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5792047 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5792048 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5792049 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5792050 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5792051 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5792052 at its peak ipv6 represented less than one hundredth of 1 percent of internet traffic
5792053 this is somewhat equivalent to the allowed parts of contaminants in drinking water
5792054 we believe this is the largest study of ipv6 and internet traffic in general to date by several orders of magnitude
5792055 though not a landslide of adoption it is still something
5792056 the us has historically been quite sluggish and most ipv6 research and implementation has been in europe and asia
5792057 two or three years ago you could make the argument that the exhaustion of ipv4 addresses is far enough away that we dont need to make the investment
5792058 now is the time for large isps and content providers to begin their migration
5792059 this massive expense comes without the lure of additional revenue since ipv6 offers diminishingly few incentives nor new competitive features to attract or upsell customers
5792060 they can suffer problems through corporate mergers because both parties might be using the same address space or they find they have a lot of network address translators which can make it challenging to deploy new applications ipv6 helps both those problems
5792061 hey amerika ich bin paris hilton und auch ich bin eine ber hmtheit nur stamme ich weder aus alten zeiten noch verspreche ich wandel wie der andere typ ich bin einfach hei
5792062 ich vermute das hei t ich kandidiere f r das pr sidentenamt
5792063 ich m chte dass amerika wei dass ich absolut bereit bin dass kommando zu bernehmen
5792064 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5792065 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5792066 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5792067 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5792068 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5792069 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5792070 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5792071 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5792072 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5792073 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5792074 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5792075 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5792076 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5792077 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5792078 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5792079 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5792080 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5792081 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5792082 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5792083 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5792084 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5792085 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5792086 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5792087 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5792088 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5792089 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5792090 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5792091 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5792092 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5792093 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5792094 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5792095 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

5792098 we have all seen what the chinese have done it has been fantastic
5792099 but i am not intimidated by that we can have a show that is equally as fantastic without wasting money
5792100 id rather be at home making love to my wife while my children are asleep
5792101 he was going to project a message that said free tibet and some other messages that would have been three stories high in different locations in beijing
5792102 the chinese leadership must realize that the only way it can make the issue of tibet disappear is to acknowledge the demands of the tibetan people and work with them to bring an end to chinas occupation of tibet
5792103 thats how close in track and field your dream can either slip away or be given to you
5792104 i couldnt quite celebrate because i didnt see it when i did the tears came
5792105 the same surreal sensation hit her again tuesday even as she ran a victory lap around the track harper couldnt quite get the feeling to sink in
5792106 i kept saying what what i was hoping no one could read my lips
5792107 i couldnt believe i was holding the flag and getting a medal it was amazing
5792108 id rather be at home making love to my wife while my children are asleep
5792109 if i had to bet my life on it id bet it is joe
5792110 barack is moving toward a seasoned beltway type and that probably means biden
5792111 georgien ist keine nato zust ndigkeit sondern aufgabe der osze
5792112 ive been pouring drinks for more than a couple years at this point
5792113 i do all kinds of fun drinks depending on what kind of mood im in
5792114 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5792115 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5792116 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5792117 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5792118 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5792119 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5792120 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5792121 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5792122 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5792123 his hands legs were amputated and his head was decapitated
5792124 there are the bloodstains on the wall and here it is dried on the floor
5792125 and here a womans shoes she was a victim of the militia we found her corpse in the grave
5792126 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5792127 spies you will dig your own graves long live the mehdi army
5792128 we found this chain on an old mans corpse that we dug out of the grave
5792129 we recovered his corpse completely rotten his hands and legs were amputated and his head was decapitated
5792130 their families are in the district the day before yesterday at noon they tried to assassinate me but i was able to call the police for help
5792131 they said they were just taking him for a few minutes for an investigation
5792132 but they never released him and we heard he might be buried behind the mosque
5792133 ultimately the ideals enshrined in the 1961 act guaranteed a professional career structure that is not politicized and which serves the state rather than partisan interests of the government i can only speak for what i know as an diplomatic career official who entered the service in 1991 according to parameters set at that time under the foreign service act of 1961 which specifically established the mechanism for entering the service the same law stipulated that exceptional and discretionary commissions could be made for specific functions and for a specified period of time and that as such they should be of a temporary nature and only with the support of qualified career diplomats
5792134 the dynamics of the diplomatic service that prevailed under the 1961 act is not sustainable
5792135 shows incredible ignorance in his misinformation perhaps the sources are anecdotal and that qualified people in management of the foreign ministry simply show their frustration at losing privileges and benefits enjoyed for nearly forty years of adeco copeyano politicization of the diplomatic service after the fall of the dictatorship in 1958
5792136 our country is in a revolutionary process of profound change which is being developed simultaneously to the major changes taking place in the international arena we are immersed in a changing scenario and we can not simply conform with outdated laws and inconsistencies with reality nor can we justify the possible existence of people who are committed to the interests of enemies to the changes led by our national government
5792137 is this the real life is this just fantasy caught in a landslide no escape from reality open your eyes look up to the skies and see im just a poor boy i need no sympathy because im easy come easy go a little high little low anyway the wind blows doesnt really matter to me to me any way the wind blows
5792138 the board examination for agri takers has a bearing on the decline in enrolment the students are very reluctant when they know that there is a board examination ched vice commissioner dr william medrano said
5792139 the gross misconception about farming has an effect on filipinos lack of interest in agriculture most filipinos think that when you take agriculture you become a farmer and when you become a farmer youre poor but if we can just change this kind of mindset we may be able to attract the students to enroll in agriculture
5792140 but these past weeks the milf has shown the exact opposite
5792141 they milf have harmed civilians burned houses of civilians and taken over civilian i think that cannot be taken lightly
5792142 if these atrocities continue i think it changes ground situation when peace process is continuing you dont attack civilians how can you have discussion on peace when forces continue to wage attacks on civilians on areas you are discussing
5792143 what it does to peace process is not for me to speculate but for peace and order stand point i think unlike three months ago when these are not happening they locals are content for peace discussion to go on but when lives were put in danger i dont think its the same situation anymore
5792144 when we talk about somebody respecting your home na di ka nanakawan pero bukas ninakaw ang kotse mo baka mali ang kausap mo after we talk and fix the problem in north cotabato and you guarantee there will be no more atrocities and you burn i will be severely disturbed
5792145 its obvious that terrorism is involve i dont see justification in attacking killing people holding hostages except to sow terror there is no justification for these acts
5792146 not to cuddle members who have been sowing terror in mindanao
5792147 they have to accept the fact that their inability to control elements under them changes the situation
5792148 im hoping that they can correct this very very quickly if it continues this way i think there will be a need to seriously take a look at the whole situation are we talking to the correct people
5792149 we are hoping to see serious changes otherwise we will be entertaining doubts that we did not entertain before
5792150 at this point although we are alarmed and disheartened by this aggression thats been shown by some elements of the milf we are still hopeful that there are some constructive people who are still desirous of the peace process
5792151 but the parameters of dialogue must be changed to reflect the conditions on the ground for those who are sincere with peace and sift out to those who are not sincere
5792152 we hope there are elements in the milf who still want peace in mindanao we hope they join us in our efforts in achieving that
5792153 weve seen refineries pull back because refining hasnt been profitable
5792154 the economic news that continues to come in is all pretty gloomy out there
5792155 if this conflict continues to widen i dont think the market is going to be able to ignore it anymore
5792156 i dont think weve seen the last of iran and israel
5792157 its just not appropriate to sit in a room and talk for eight years meanwhile oilsands development is approved on the landscape
5792158 and we could no longer legitimately support a process that was being used to deflect attention from the governments failure to protect the environment
5792159 certainly these latest developments will be part of that discussion and then what the next steps will be are very much dependent on what that decision is
5792160 d a medvedev agreed with the view of the u n secretary general about the need to work out a security council resolution in connection with the situation around south ossetia
5792161 underlined that the main task of the security council at the current stage is to support the peace plan of august 12 which is based on six principles

5792175 through these traffic surveillance cameras we will be able to monitor on a 24 hour basis the traffic conditions along major roadways and report on any accidents so that we can immediately deploy our personnel and emergency vehicles
5792176 the installation of these traffic cameras is part of our effort to fine tune the details of the obr before its full implementation
5792177 life is full of misery loneliness and suffering and its all over much too soon
5792178 he wouldnt have noticed if my head had fallen off
5792179 the worse things get the funnier i think they are thats just how i grew up how i learned to handle things
5792180 but aside from that i think you have to be funny so that other people dont freak out i mean its fine to be going oh my god i have cancer with your closest friends but you cant do that with everyone you cant ask the entire world to buoy you up
5792181 with cancer its saying you can take my body but youre not taking my mind
5792182 theres a form of macho defiance there i really like
5792183 we asked people to think about stressful experiences in the past month
5792184 people high in self enhancing humor simply dont perceive as much stress in their lives as people with a self defeating humor style
5792185 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5792186 i dont want to be a person like it has been mentioned about i dont want to be deprived of the huge amounts or lessons allah has prepared for the believers in the hereafter

5792306 this time under the command of rear admiral joseph kernan kernan who up till now has been commander of naval special warfare command has a background that is rather worrying
5792307 the naval officer belongs to the navy seals an elite commando team made up of men chosen for the toughest of special operations trained to act in the most adverse and challenging conditions they were in action in vietnam cambodia and laos the choice of kernan to command the fourth fleet according even to the pentagons own admission is absolutely unusual
5792308 furthermore with this decision the southern command reaches the same level of importance as the central command operating in the persian gulf with the u s fifth fleet
5792309 what reason could the united states have to send such a powerful naval force to a region in peace without nuclear power without any real military conflicts or threats
5792310 they are never going to admit that it is because of natural resources but it is no coincidence that this decision comes up just when a structural change in world economy is beginning where reserves of fresh water food and energy resources take on a position of important strategic value

5792335 this turned out pretty interesting the mccain voters are much bigger cheaters two out of 9 mccain people cheated and only 3 out of 31 obama people
5792336 we are extremely pleased with the outcome of this transaction which further strengthens our liquidity position

5792342 do you want me to leave or you want me to stay
5792343 i would like you to stay all day with me
5792344 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5792345 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5792346 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5792347 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5792348 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5792349 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5792350 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5792351 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5792352 so i have a job to do a job to complete in that sense yes i would like to run
5792353 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing on its own and living off its own means
5792354 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5792355 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country
5792356 does not have a properly functional government yet it must get that
5792357 the reason we are still around is because of the immense resilience of the afghan people and their goodheartedness toward the presence of the international community
5792358 other than that activities like breaking into homes would have gotten us into serious trouble a long time back
5792359 we also want the weaponry in this war to be targeted at the terrorists properly to be aimed at the right place
5792360 i dont want afghan casualties the war on terrorism is not in afghan villages period it is in the sanctuaries of terrorists at the training ground of terrorists at the financial resources of terrorists
5792361 it is virtually impossible to mitigate against loss of civilian lives when insurgents mix in with the local population
5792362 i dont for a second believe that afghanistan has a problem of terrorism
5792363 afghanistan has only suffered at the hands of terrorism or the consequences of it
5792364 what is troubling is the deteriorating set of conditions across the border in pakistan military sanctuaries expanding in areas in the tribal area and the freedom of movement across the border to afghanistan
5792365 with regard to corruption its a deeper problem its an afghan problem
5792366 its the problem of an inefficient government machinery its a problem of economy procedures its a problem of so much money coming into afghanistan its a problem of the international presence
5792367 its a problem i know will take time its a problem i know the afghan people want addressed and sooner rather than later
5792368 its not an option for any coalition partner to default on the understanding and agreement we have made not only among ourselves but to the nation
5792369 we will do it in a way we did with musharraf everyone will be in agreement
5792370 theyll find another fake issue to focus on and then another

5792380 he was going to project a message that said free tibet and some other messages that would have been three stories high in different locations in beijing

5792382 we never went out during the time we were training
5792383 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a military camp
5792384 north korea is no 1 in the world when it comes to uniformity they are uniform beyond belief these kind of traditional synchronized movements result in a sense of beauty we chinese are able to achieve this as well though hard training and strict discipline
5792385 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
5792386 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month
5792387 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5792388 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5792389 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5792390 all the tears the sweat and sometimes even blood that we shed i now think it was quite worth it
5792391 when we performed that night all that i could feel in my heart was joy pure joy

5792398 truth be told even i would say there are not a lot of women on the level of the brokaws and the schieffers
5792399 its the networks that are so thin on women and people of color
5792400 jesus agenda is far bigger than just one or two issues we have to care about poverty we have to care about disease we have to care about illiteracy we have to care about corruption in government sex trafficking
5792401 if obama ever establishes any kind of trust with evangelicals there will be a noticeable shift
5792402 it will not be huge but it will be significant
5792403 number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
5792404 the encouraging thing is that in 2004 we didnt have any part in the platform discussion
5792405 this time the party wanted us as a partner in the process they reached out to us and wanted to hear what we had to say
5792406 in fact the bullying right wing obsessively anti gay dogmatically pro capitalist and pro war christianity that has dominated visible us christianity in recent times is basically a dated reagan era political phenomenon concocted largely by gop strategists
5792407 remember the rich for you shall have them with you always

5792416 some commissioners have argued that the relative value units of the physician fee schedule should be at least partly based on a services value to medicare for example if analysis of clinical effectiveness for a given condition were to show that one service were superior to an alternative service for a given condition then medicares process of setting relative values might reflect that this process would be a departure from the established method of setting relative values based only on the time mental effort technical skill and effort psychological stress and risk of performing the service

5792430 cdfa has demonstrated that they will lie cheat and even sacrifice the lives of californias children in order to steal 100s of millions of emergency funds set aside for real emergencies
5792431 we are now into the third year after noticing the light brown apple moth in california and recognizing that lbam has been living here about 30 50 years or more while doing no damage the cdfa is getting more and more desperate to quickly implement fake emergency eradication methods so they can access the emergency funds and pretend they are saving california by stopping the lbam from doing damage for emergency funding it seems the cdfa would claim to save us from lady bugs if we didnt know better
5792432 as more and more people and elected officials are learning the truth about lbam and the cdfa the likelihood grows that the participants in this eradication fraud at cdfa will pay for their crimes
5792433 but things went wrong in high school he got involved with the wrong crowd

5792467 i think take two is going to negotiate a dollar per share higher and then claim victory a deal is going to get done
5792468 that 25 74 was predicated on distributing their products at christmas this year
5792469 going forward we are challenged to validate that 25 74 price

5792475 i am very happy and i am pleased with the consistency in my flights today because there was just a very small difference between my times in the two qualifying sessions
5792476 it was quite stormy and unpleasant in london but that does not mean that we can afford to lose concentration when the weather is more pleasant it is very easy to pick up penalties
5792477 in the second session i made a mistake which meant i was punished for that but still it was a good preparation for tomorrow ill look to see where i can find the extra tenths of a second
5792478 if i am among the top four tomorrow then anything is possible
5792479 it is still not performing as well as it will be in 25 or 30 hours but it is definitely an improvement
5792480 i will just try my best be as fast as possible and try not to make any mistakes

5792491 isnt it better to stand up and say right out loud what you are affiliated with instead of having a silent allegiance to a political party or an undisclosed agenda for personal gain
5792492 im particularly disappointed that the greens have seen fit to put themselves on a political party ticket
5792493 there has never been a place for party politics in local government in yass valley
5792494 local government needs to be governed by our service to the people and not our political affiliations
5792495 local government is grass roots government it is the closest arm of government for the people
5792496 i respect the fact the group are proud to be greens but they should be very proud to be representatives of the community
5792497 we all have our political feelings and affiliations but i feel there is no place for them in local government
5792498 if a candidate is elected from a political party is he she taking directions from the political party or from the people that elected him her
5792499 in local government you vote for the people not the party it takes decision making well away from the average rate payer
5792500 there are some very principled people among the current group of candidates and we would look forward to working closely with them to achieve the best outcomes for yass valley we have a lot more in common than we have differences
5792501 in my time there were some avid country party followers some avid labor party followers and some avid liberal party followers but none voted according to party politics
5792502 they voted for people politics for the people of yass

5792505 my vision for yass valley is for it to become a region where the council actively informs the community and seeks out the views of the residents of the valley on all items arising in their local area that come to council the councillors and council staff will then deal with these items in accordance with the wishes of the relevant community the yass valley will have a strong and vibrant network of community consultative groups for example the murrumbateman progress association to facilitate this flow of information to and from council
5792506 weve known that nike has long been in development for the iphone now were finally getting a peek at the first shots of the interface from what we can skim nike users will get all of the nifty performance graphs right on the phone before this stuff was available on the web only but the biggest improvement over the old nike system may be google maps support

5792508 one of the most important jobs of the supreme court is to guard against the encroachment of the executive branch on the power of the other branches i think he has been a little bit too willing or eager to give an administration whether mine or george bushs more power than the constitution originally intended
5792509 should be based on the criteria of proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench and by the way justices alito and roberts are two of my most recent favorites
5792510 the only law we identify as unconstitutional is mca sec 7 28 usca 2241 e supp 2007

5792527 i have an entirely open mind on the single authority

5792530 i am interested in clever strategic decisions for the long term benefit of the river
5792531 what would be helpful for me is if there was a consensus based position paper signed by you that would be a very useful starting point
5792532 bear in mind there is a lot of pessimism about the financial sector in general so when there is eyebrow raising news about lehman option traders are extra vigilant on that stock in particular

5792747 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5792748 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5792749 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5792750 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5792751 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5792752 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5792753 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5792754 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5792755 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5792756 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5792757 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5792758 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5792759 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5792760 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5792761 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5792762 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5792763 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5792764 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5792765 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5792766 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5792767 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5792768 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5792769 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5792770 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5792771 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5792772 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5792773 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5792774 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5792775 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5792776 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5792777 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

5792780 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co florida republicans boycott todays primary in sympathy with democrats
5792781 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5792782 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5792783 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5792784 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5792785 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5792786 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5792787 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5792788 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5792789 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5792790 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5792791 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5792792 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5792793 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5792794 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5792795 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5792796 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5792797 this is a planning took where all things are going

5792813 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5792814 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5792815 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5792816 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5792817 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5792818 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5792819 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5792820 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

5792827 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5792828 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets

5792837 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5792838 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5792839 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5792840 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5792841 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5792842 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5792843 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5792844 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5792845 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5792846 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5792847 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success

5792854 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5792855 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5792856 it is time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
5792857 potential for loss of life and damage to the environment
5792858 and now mccain is standing with the oil companies in opposing a bipartisan compromise in congress that would expand offshore drilling and at the same time make serious investments in alternative energy to break our dependence on foreign oil
5792859 the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis
5792860 we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
5792861 u n mediators cant even protect the dissident monks of burma or the opposition in zimbabwe let alone a small country trying to fight off single handed an invasion by the russian army
5792862 immediately and unconditionally cease military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5792863 u s should immediately work with the e u and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
5792864 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
5792865 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world

5792871 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5792872 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5792873 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5792874 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5792875 someone who believes and helps to spread the doctrine of another
5792876 the study of god presupposes that there is a god to study what evidence is there to support this
5792877 o brave old world that has such people in it
5792878 you can save yourself time by confining your attention to two systems hinduism and christianity i believe these are the two serious options for an adult mind materialism is a philosophy for boys the purely moral systems like stoicism and confucianism are philosophies for aristocrats islam is only a christian heresy and buddhism a hindu heresy both are simplifications inferior to the things simplified as for the old pagan religions i think we could say that whatever was of value in them survives either in hinduism or in christianity or in both and there only they are the two system which have come down still alive into the present without leaving the past behind
5792879 goodbye christianity then unless you want to repudiate the notion that yahweh is good
5792880 whatever divides the good from the evil must be over and above either of the two
5792881 how fitting that an authoritarian follower would close with an appeal to authority
5792882 the study of god presupposes that there is a god to study what evidence is there to support this
5792883 how then are we to distinguish things that are designed from things that are not designed if everything is designed
5792884 known unto god are all his works from the foundation of the world
5792885 why do you believe that only personality begets personality and how do you know and what reason do we who dont share your beliefs have to accept this
5792886 what evidence is there to support the fall of man and its consequences
5792887 i dont see how the fact that human beings one species on one world among all the worlds in the universe have strong feelings about things would falsify the hypothesis that the universe itself is indifferent
5792888 you havent given us an reason to share your view
5792889 known unto god are all his works from the foundation of the world
5792890 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5792891 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought

5792934 hey ben come play for a team thats stuck in win now mode with a roster that isnt good enough to compete in our own division
5792935 sheets lives in dallas the astros would never get him over the rangers
5792936 i dont see why sheets would want to go to either texas team from a pitching stand point both play in unforgiving launching pads that will inevitably extend outings and put strain on his fragile frame
5792937 we figured that it would be nice to have a place to store our gear indefinitely and we definitely plan on using it to our fullest potential there are no set times we have to leave the studio we just get to stay up all night rehearsing and working on music
5792938 to be honest i think its better to have a label than to be diy its great for a starting band but if youre an established band it just makes sense you have bands like radiohead and nine inch nails who dont care to make money anymore or selling x amount of records being diy just makes sense
5792939 you know i always feel i got too much credit for that
5792940 the band existed before me and it was their decision to add keys and synths
5792941 we all write though im on synth mostly its a very democratic process clark writes the best drum beats and naturally todd writes the bulk of the lyrics and vocal melodies its really a team effort
5792942 i think working with mike mogis on wet from birth left the recording just erring on the side of overproduced
5792943 we were somewhat worried that people thought wed be going through the motions on our new record but thats not the case
5792944 we are still pushing the boundaries sonically and were still using new technology and trying to challenge ourselves
5792945 its all about the bigger picture and addresses so many variants in philosophy theres so many thoughts that are deeply involved in the idea of belief and im fascinated by that in the same way
5792946 i think that other people are the most fascinating things on the planet in a personal relationship vocalist todd fink writes about what hes fascinated about the title of the record represents a desire to create its the best word for how we live our lives

5792957 as i read through scripture i am convinced that the greatest indicator or mark of a christian is the presence of the holy spirit in their lives paul tells us in romans 8 9 11
5792958 however you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if indeed the spirit of god dwells in you but if anyone does not have the spirit of christ he does not belong to him if christ is in you though the body is dead because of sin yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness but if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised christ jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his spirit who dwells in you
5792959 repent and each of you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit acts 2 38
5792960 for the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off as many as the lord our god will call to himself acts 2 39
5792961 for he is not a jew who is one outwardly nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh but he is a jew who is one inwardly and circumcision is that which is of the heart by the spirit not by the letter and his praise is not from men but from god

5792989 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy said applegate

5792996 heartened to learn that most voters dont buy into the spoiler argument being espoused by partisan talking heads thats how russell verney campaign manager for barr and former campaign manager for h ross perot puts it
5792997 people want real change and they know that they are not going to get it from a republican or a democrat verney says
5792998 americas only hope for change is by allowing more competition in the political process and that means opening the debates to any candidate who can meet the ballot access criteria
5792999 enough state ballots to have at least a mathematical chance of securing an electoral college majority in the 2008 general election

5793001 the wise man says he who trusts in himself is a fool
5793002 and thus they bantered back and forth christian answering each of ignorances assumptions with truth from the bible this faith of yours is nowhere in the bible true faith takes refuge in christs righteousness not your own
5793003 what would you have us trust to what christ has done without us you would have us sin all we want because we may be justified by christs personal righteousness as long as we believe in it
5793004 you are ignorant of the true effects of faith in this righteousness of christ which is to commit your heart to god in christ and to love his ways
5793005 and yet they dont know that such conviction of sin and consequent fear tend to their good they try to stifle their fear but the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom did you know a man assertive in religion named temporary
5793006 he dwelt in graceless two miles from honesty he lived under the same roof and turnback
5793007 well temporary was awakened to his sins once he even told me he was resolved to go on the pilgrimage but after he drew acquainted with save self he became a stranger
5793008 there were four reason i think although his conscience was awakened his mind was unchanged and he was held by the world he didnt want to lose everything a third reason was the shame he felt for religion and lastly he hated the feelings of guilt and hardened his heart and now you tell me how a man backslides
5793009 thy block all thoughts of god death and judgment then by degrees they cast off their private duties of prayer curbing their lust ogling and guilt they shun the company of christians they cast off public duties of hearing reading and conferring then they begin to make fun of the godly so they feel better about leaving religion

5793026 the daily show news scraper 117 stories 73 situation rooms 26 news tickers
5793027 you all the news stories first before its even true
5793028 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5793029 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about
5793030 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to mask or repress that through whatever creative devices we can find
5793031 those types of stories that can almost like the guy in the green mile
5793032 suck in all the toxins and allow you to do something with it that is palatable

5793036 you go i know what ill do ill create a character who when hiring people to rebuild the nation we invaded says the only question ill ask is what do you think of roe v wade itll be hilarious then you read that book about the green zone in iraq
5793037 and you go oh they did that i mean how do you take things to the next level
5793038 as a comedian as a person as a citizen as a mammal
5793039 being conducted on the scale that bush conducted things or even the clintons i dont think it has the same true viciousness and contempt

5793041 named after something that no matter how long you head towards it you never quite reach it
5793042 time it takes lenscrafters to make you a pair of bifocals
5793043 may be exaggerated on the show its grounded in the way jon really feels
5793044 all these data points of spin and transparent falsehoods dished out in the form of political discourse
5793045 fish from that what is the true meaning what are red herrings false leads
5793046 we often discuss satire the sort of thing he does and to a certain extent i do as distillery
5793047 you have an enormous amount of material and you have to distill it to a syrup by the end of the day so much of it is a hewing process chipping away at things that arent the point or arent the story or arent the intention really its that last couple of drops youre distilling that makes all the difference it isnt that hard to get a ton of corn into a gallon of sour mash but to get that gallon of sour mash down to that one shot of pure whiskey takes patience
5793048 for ourselves so that we can drain whatever abscess there is in our hearts so we can move on to the business of making you laugh
5793049 sit in the back of the country and make wisecracks
5793050 the process of the show is to bury those feelings as subtext and that was a real moment of text its laying bare the type of thing that is there hopefully to inform the show but the show is usually an exercise in hiding that

5793230 it would be great i really wanted to stand again for the ioc because i really enjoy that work and i feel i can make a difference because ive had a quite a lot of experience after five olympics
5793231 i knew about a year ago that id put myself up for election again
5793232 the chances of getting elected are pretty small because youve got huge numbers from european countries and new zealands so small
5793233 were quite a small sport and sailors really arent that interested in that sort of stuff but its very big in europe and asia the chances of getting voted on are actually quite slim
5793234 we can tell athletes it is an important mechanism and they should vote but not who they should vote for we dont have an ioc member so it is important to have someone at that level
5793235 i dont know what im going to do the 40 year old mother of two said
5793236 ill have a at least a year off and go knitting
5793237 if there was some wind there id think about it but i would never race in qingdao again
5793238 the wind is so ridiculously light its just not sailing here its a pumping contest
5793239 i have breastfed kobi at the station and i have even expressed during district management meetings with my back turned in a room full of men so i did not miss any information
5793240 the men were great it has meant i could remain in top management and be a working mum 11 weeks after giving birth and not miss out on anything
5793241 they even accommodate me so i can take kobi overseas when i have to travel with work you could not ask for a better working environment
5793242 i had to kick my boss out of his office to express and it was such hard work making a real fist of it for both my job and my daughter

5793244 we are prepared to go to a meeting with all the agencies and slap a file on a desk and say take out of it what you want and hell yes it is making a difference
5793245 in the past we would not have taken that step now we say you can see the situation clearly we dont care if its the weekend and a bean counter has said wait till monday just get that kid out now
5793246 we dont expect the police or other government agencies to share our information without a good reason for doing so for example it may be necessary to disclose information to avert a threat to someones safety
5793247 you can have all the rules about silence that you like but if that child is still at risk what good is that it is about that childs safety
5793248 a mongrel mob member a convicted murderer said to me this is the most evil valley in new zealand it is where you kill your kids

5793250 that was my job today to do a job for the team and cover guys for bevan and kris gemmell shane said after watching docherty receive his medal
5793251 and know i may have played a little part in helping him
5793252 winning a medal was totally in my mind to finish that far back was really discouraging but the whole olympics just being here was amazing but the expatriate kiwi was delighted docherty got a medal
5793253 shane must have done a good job there helping him the new zealand team sat down a week ago to plot strategies
5793254 cover off their key rivals including spanish ace javier gomez who finished fourth and canadas silver medallist simon whitfield
5793255 brotherly love was set aside when the duo compete against each other and he
5793256 matty reed go big guy but her heart was equally with shane in the white suit of new zealand
5793257 i thought it was really good to see shane up ther after the swim because hes always been an excellent swimmer and it was also good to see matt in front on the bike
5793258 and probably catch a few events together with boxing high on the agenda
5793259 i told you to leave and now im making you

5793267 it actually came up when i was about 8 months pregnant and i was beached like a whale
5793268 you know what i think i could that that would be great for me to do maybe ill do it this year
5793269 thank god we won i think each one of us is trying to pick each other up it probably weighs on us a little bit
5793270 it doesnt matter how we win as long as we win
5793271 this is a big win for us because weve been scuffling weve been scuffling to score runs maybe this is the game that we needed that gets us back on the winning track and we can run a bunch off in a row
5793272 so we have to try to win the most games that we can possibly win and take every game as if its the last game of the world series
5793273 when you dont have the focus on your job its not like an excuse but if you dont feel comfortable something happens to you where you cant do your job
5793274 for us to try to get something back instead of him just walking with no compensation is a position we have to take
5793275 everybody knows he had been through that little rough spot he is human everyone goes through that he bounced back very nicely we need him big time
5793276 my location is pretty good now my breaking ball and sinker is doing everything now i have to keep working every day

5793280 god left a world unfinished for man to work his skill upon he left the electricity still in the cloud the oil still in the earth he left the rivers unbridged and the forest unfilled and the cities unbuilt god gave to man the challenge of raw materials not the ease of finished things he left the problem unsolved and the pictures unpainted and the music unsung that man might know the joys and glories of creator god created the quarries but he carves the statues only by the hand of man

5793321 they are also waiting to see some improvements from last season i hope to pull in some offers from schools i am interested in like michigan state illinois and florida and ohio state i get e mails on a regular basis from most of those schools and coaches now that practice has started i dont get a lot of chances to talk to them
5793322 its just what i think is best for me i think central would be a good fit for me i have been to all three schools and central has been the best so far its not like which is in the best conference its more like where i can go and get a good education and play football
5793323 once you get recruited by florida you have to be the best of the best
5793324 i would love to have them come watch me play i just think they would see that i could keep up in that type of competition i think they would notice some good talent on our team as well and i think that it might help some of my teammates pick up some offers
5793325 i want to see how the team has progressed from june till now
5793326 i am just excited for the first game against warren central out of indianapolis thats our first game they have won three state championships in indiana we are just taking it one game at a time

5793396 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5793397 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5793398 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5793399 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5793400 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5793401 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5793402 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5793403 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5793404 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5793405 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5793406 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5793407 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5793408 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5793409 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5793410 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5793411 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document to remain a dead letter
5793412 its going to take a federal government and a president that is open to it
5793413 the outcome of this election will determine that outcome i believe that if barack obama gets elected he will slam the door shut on these options
5793414 he understands that any longterm energy policy for this country is going to have to include many components including a nuclear one
5793415 renewable fuel association in october 07 there were 131 grain ethanol bio refineries in the u
5793416 that developed nations should stop paying agricultural subsidies to encourage biofuel production because those payments are making staple foods more expensive
5793417 the use of us croplands for biofuels causes increased greenhouse gas emissions through emissions from land use change
5793418 the widening credit quality spreads in the money and bond markets is certainly unsettling
5793419 the market has handled bad news well for the past few weeks which could indicate that investors are beginning to look out into the future
5793420 for now though traders are back to the present and worried about the here and now we could get a test of the recent lows over the next few weeks
5793421 the us indicators today carry a strong flavour of stagflation
5793422 the man was reported missing by a friend when his empty boat was located early the next morning
5793423 it was about 4 30 in the morning when he jumped off the roof of the houseboat he swam a couple of hundred feet from the boat when his friends realized that he appeared to be struggling and attempted to rescue him using a large inflatable air mattress but he was gone and hasnt been seen since
5793424 because of his actions at the scene and things he said our officers at the scene knew this individual had some mental health issues he was taken to the hospital by police he had to be physically restrained in order to be put in the police vehicle
5793425 he clipped a vehicle just prior to hitting the kelowna residents he missed most of it but caught the bumper then he carried on and thats when he hit the kelowna couple
5793426 at one point the driver was told to stop the vehicle when he did he was pulled from the front seat put in the rear seat the victim was then assaulted several times when police located the victim he had injuries to his face and arms
5793427 one of the suspects was arrested and will be appearing in court monday facing charges of robbery assault with a weapon assault causing bodily harm forcible confinement and breach of probation order the second suspect is facing charges of robbery assault causing bodily harm and forcible confinement
5793428 someone could have up to three dogs up to three cats and up to three others be it rabbits lizards or other if they want more than three of any one type of animal they would have to apply for a permit
5793429 existing pets would be grandfathered in we arent going to make anyone give up their pets for adoption if the bylaw gets passed
5793430 its been extreme the different points of view weve received one man who called was totally against it and another said the bylaw doesnt go far enough
5793431 i think the decision to appeal is shameful to say the least its a complete waste of taxpayers money
5793432 this document is a trust for the benefit of the citizens that this land is to be held not sold in perpetuity for the benefit of citizens and is to be used for municipal purposes so why would the citizens elected officials got to court to have that struck down its just bizarre i dont understand the decision making process at city hall that would do that when i believe the vast majority of citizens simply would like it to be left alone yet the elected officials will not leave it alone
5793433 these include the wetland inventory mapping project sensitive habitat inventory mapping project and the sensitive eco system inventory project
5793434 due to their environmental significance and sensitivity many water based and land based features within the city of kelowna have already been designated as natural environment development permit areas
5793435 overall the proposed amendment would see the removal of 62 properties from the development permit areas while including an additional 686 properties
5793436 the only way this can be stopped is to re open the debate the only way to do that is through a new council
5793437 it will take a new council to defeat this approach
5793438 i feel this should now be in the hands of the electorate which will go to the polls on november 15 and encourage everyone to consider asking every candidate if they will vote to defeat the appeal of the covenant my answer is already that i will
5793439 i continue to support these initiatives of council but to walk proudly in the city of kelowna i cannot defend the approach taken by council today monday i am willing to deal with any of the consequences as a result of this decision and can only apologize to the citizens for not being able to bring forward a different decision than was reached monday
5793440 approximately 1800 new boat slips will be added over the next five years with 1400 of those for private use in addition there are plans for dock storage for 315 boats with the potential for more
5793441 we found 77 what we called points of interest and narrowed that down to 47 those could be anything from a boat launch to a marina to mooring buoys
5793442 i think this re establishes what some of us on city council have been saying for quite a while that we have a major shortage of facilities for boats im kind of shocked about 40 per cent of the people have some sort of boat which is very eye opening
5793443 just thinking of alternative places of storing trailers i think we really need to be out of the box on that there is the notion of valet service
5793444 i think of schools for example and all the parking lots that are vacant in the summertime maybe the school district could make a deal to rent parking lots and putting some money back into the school system
5793445 city council is seeking greater clarity in the judgment the court determined that the covenant is not valid but does exist as a charitable trust
5793446 the city will ask the appeal court to clarify whether it is possible to create a trust under common law
5793447 the city will ask the appeal court to rule on whether a charitable trust can be established when land is not gifted the city purchased the land in 1946
5793448 city council is committed to preserving public ownership and public access to the waterfront land and the city hall site
5793449 at the time it wasnt clear if there was damage to the beams its taken some time to determine that and an approximate value
5793450 on this album i got to work with different people and learn what their habits were and what works well with me
5793451 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality
5793452 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like irreplaceable by beyonce where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5793453 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5793454 we made the decision with ben and jeff a little while ago its what everybody has wanted
5793455 ben was looking for a role where he wasnt involved in day to day operation of millard group but could be involved in the more overall strategic services of the services group
5793456 working with me on some of the needs of the services group
5793457 jeff is a perfect fit he knows the clients and employees very well
5793458 the whole neighborhood has been calling about the mosquitoes and the stagnant water
5793459 we keep off by the door and spray them down before they go out
5793460 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5793461 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5793462 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5793463 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5793464 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5793465 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5793466 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5793467 we say join the club it makes us feel old too

5793472 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5793473 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5793474 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5793475 except for all the donkeys who run alongside the riders in the mountains thats got to be pretty hard when youre that drunk
5793476 what other sport allows drunken spectators to yell and spit right in the face of the athletes as they perform nearly inhuman feats of strength and endurance
5793477 two of the happiest days of my life were when lemond beat fignon in 1989 and when landis made his comeback in 2006 two of the saddest were when hamilton got popped in the vuelta and when floyd cracked in the yellow jersey dont even get me started on the giants and niners
5793478 bike racing may be a little hard for some people to appreciate but generally speaking guys like things that go fast and crash a lot and ladies like hairless dudes in tight shorts there is obviously a lot more to it than that but we are talking about americans here
5793479 this is where the future of cycling in america is going to come from people who grew up in the lemond 7 eleven armstrong eras are starting to have lots of kids and many of them have a lot of money to spend would you rather have a child that races bikes or plays football
5793480 i have always been fascinated by the strength of this phenomenon and am certain that much of the lance armstrong effect was purely a result of his dominance in the tour as a proud flag waving american regardless there is a palpable confidence which comes from supporting a winner unless of course you happen to be from france
5793481 avait t amen lh pital quand lexplosion sest produite dans la salle des urgences
5793482 i loved competitive games that challenged me physically and mentally
5793483 i did well at those competitions and i think in many ways they prepared me for the problem solving aspects of being an artist painting can be thought of as a similar process of acquiring knowledge planning strategies maintaining stamina and facing challenges
5793484 i first started using game boards dolls and other childhood memorabilia in my paintings about 20 years ago but i didnt make them the focus of a series until i began working on these paintings about two years ago
5793485 i placed orchids in front of game boards within square format paintings to contrast beautiful living flowing plant material against well worn geometric patterns and then i expanded the scale of the work with nude figures against boards enlarged way beyond their actual size eventually i allowed the pictures to become more autobiographical by pulling in images from my recollections of the coney island amusement park near cincinnati
5793486 i visited an amusement park in connecticut with my family and i was struck by the images of garishly colored stuffed animals crudely painted signage bored attendants darts balloons and colored lights all of them associated with games of chance and skill
5793487 i remembered how exciting all of that was to me as a child how my daughter was reacting with the same enthusiasm and how the carnival had remained much the same as when it was depicted in drawings and paintings by such artists as edward hopper reginald marsh and isabel bishop i imagined how i might respond to these scenes of isolated lonely figures engaged in a business that was intended to be amusing challenging and rewarding i was especially intrigued by a game in which contestants would earn points by rolling balls with the number of points being used to determine how fast they could race cars occupied by ghosts the person who won the most points and moved his or her car to the finish line first would win a prize
5793488 i was determined to create these new paintings from life not photographs
5793489 i searched the internet to locate appropriate stuffed animals and then by chance i found a bag of them my daughter won at the very same amusement park it was tedious painting the graphic designs on the booths and the signage above and it took me a long time to determine where to position the stuffed animals and how to paint portraits of each of them
5793490 it seemed a little curious to be assigning so much importance to toys but a realist painter has to be willing to paint everything with the same degree of attention and detail
5793491 they may have been stuffed animals but they functioned within the pictures as colored shapes that would catch the viewers eye and contribute to the context of the ideas being explored
5793492 my inclination was to make them more polished and precise but that would have been inconsistent with the graphic images that are part of a carnival
5793493 in most cases placards were painted decades ago by amateur sign painters to identify the individual booths and to encourage people to compete for prizes
5793494 i actually had to add some unfamiliar paints to my palette to replicate the day glow orange iridescent blue and shocking purple of the bears in
5793495 and i spent many hours painting each of the pegs and their cast shadows on the spinning wheel included in whack a clown the combination of shapes textures and patterns in that painting were unlike any i had ever combined into one picture
5793496 i keep careful records of the canvas board paper colors preparation mediums model preparatory studies starting and ending dates and hours of labor involved in each of my paintings
5793497 i recommend that every artist keep such records for his or her own benefit i frequently refer to my notes when i want to recall how i achieved certain effects in a painting where i got the still life material who the models were what medium i used to modify the paints what varnish i applied once the picture was dry and where the paintings were exhibited and perhaps sold
5793498 i particularly enjoyed painting each of the balloons because several were translucent enough to reveal the numbers underneath while others reflected the colors and shapes of the nearby balloons
5793499 and i decided i wanted to paint a portrait of the young man in wheel of fortune as soon as he arrived at my studio in north salem new york to model for one of my summer workshops he was actually wearing that orange shirt and the decorated jean jacket and i thought they characterized the kind of rebellious free spirited drifter who would take off to join the circus his pensive gaze also suggested the contradictory emotions of a man who is supposed to be enticing people with a game of fun excitement and reward
5793500 i have long been fascinated by the decorative elements in russian icons and gold leaf decorations
5793501 on some level the antique boards and well worn signs serve a similar decorative function in the carnival paintings
5793502 on one level the painting uses a standard portrait device of positioning a figure against a warm brown background
5793503 but when you consider that the man is holding sharply pointed darts used to pop the balloons and penetrate the red and white wheel and that there is a folk art game in which contestants use a pistol to shoot metal objects extending from a mans mouth you recognize that games often involve a level of violence and destruction i suppose one could extend that recognition to include the current video games that treat violence as a form of entertainment

5793512 there are a certain number of taxes that we could raise in certain areas but that tax on the indians would require some litigation and some real negotiation which ive been meaning to do anyway
5793513 mccain has lost all touch with the realities of american families
5793514 considering john mccain has a legitimate and great plan to help homeowners engaging in class warfare and engaging in politics of the past doesnt do anything to help us move forward
5793515 my doctor has advised me not to travel in the short term and so regretfully i am unable to attend what will surely be an historic convention in denver
5793516 i was very much looking forward to chairing the california delegation and i offer my best wishes to californias delegates in this vital nomination process
5793517 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5793518 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5793519 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5793520 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5793521 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5793522 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level
5793523 the behaviour of russia in this most recent conflict is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation among nations
5793524 when you start invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of its infrastructure that is isolating
5793525 it is not an act of the united states or the european union or anyone else to isolate russia it is what russia is doing
5793526 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime save a collapsing regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
5793527 pana wyst pienie na wiecu w tbilisi by o bardzo ostre potem m wi pan nam dziennikarzom kt rzy tam byli o koalicji kraj w symbolizuj cej dawn rzeczpospolit

5793529 i dont think there is a banking chief executive in the world who doesnt have some issues to address at the moment and i havent seen anything to date that we cant resolve
5793530 obviously there are some specialist loans which have got high arrears at the moment but the core lending book the prime buy to let book is very solid
5793531 were all very big players its not a big concern to us
5793532 to make sure that the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly and not to weigh in for or against a particular candidate
5793533 nuclear weapons are only a problem for people with bad nerves
5793534 when the community works together to gather school supplies we are sending a message that kids matter education is important and we support our schools and families
5793535 we certainly appreciate all of the help our local hospital provides to our community
5793536 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5793537 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5793538 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5793539 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5793540 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5793541 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5793542 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5793543 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5793544 this is a good deal for tube lines we are pleased that following constructive discussions with the rmt today we have been able to agree in principle a two year deal that will satisfy all parties
5793545 i have never seen such a big rally in srinagar
5793546 data cards arent just for road warriors but also for couch and kitchen warriors
5793547 consumers dont like to pay for the same thing twice
5793548 its movies that are about more the domestic sphere more about relationships between characters family relationships and less about the whole political sweep of whats going on in the world
5793549 jade came out from that and said to her housemates what she had been told everyone was pretty shocked she was extremely upset it was clear from that point that she had to leave
5793550 i will worry for my beautiful boys if i get unwell
5793551 i have to keep working to support my family its not an option to stop i have to pay the bills at the end of the day
5793552 mrs fields was sold to its current owners in 1996 i have no role or association with the company having resigned as a director and consultant in 2000
5793553 any way you slice it pizza fusions vegan pizza offers all of the flavor but none of the cholesterol and cruelty that come with meat and cheese
5793554 pizza fusion is a great example of the growing number of restaurants meeting americas hunger for healthy and humane cuisine
5793555 for making a tasty pizza with vegan options we felt it was only right to include pizza fusion on our top 10 vegan friendly pizzerias list
5793556 by providing vegan options these pizzerias not only make vegans happy but help show others that you can still have a good pizza that is healthier for you without any animal suffering our list was compiled from the nominations of our very well traveled staff here at peta who are constantly on the road speaking up for animals

5793559 le est n pegando los datos econ micos en estados unidos y obviamente la noticia de venezuela no habr a sido bien recibida
5793560 como gobierno respetamos la decisi n de los poderes venezolanos pero estamos obligados a velar por los intereses de nuestras empresas
5793561 su preocupaci n por el efecto de la expropiaci n de cemex
5793562 estamos en un per odo de reconstrucci n de las relaciones bilaterales esperamos que esto siga siendo posible reaccionaremos seg n se desarrollen los acontecimientos
5793563 debido a que la cifra solicitada por cemex es muy alta muy por encima de los 1 300 millones de d lares
5793564 cemex tiene problemas ambientales de atraso de tecnolog a lo que significa que no puede ser un valor muy por encima de lo que estamos adquiriendo
5793565 acho que devemos tranferir a fulana pra um dos novos postos em financas
5793566 the cool thing about the camp is that you get the high school players and theyre the coaches
5793567 we have little flag football teams and its not only about getting coached by the high school players but getting to know the guys youre going to be watching on friday nights those guys are like gods i was in awe when i was a kid thats how big of an impact people can have on somebody
5793568 you know how those kids see it and you remember how you felt about those guys its a really special time for our program its not only a chance to help the younger kids become better players but its a chance to give back
5793569 for me that team that was the state championship team that team belongs to the seniors of last year and not us
5793570 you go and win a state championship and you cant not do the same thing the next year we all know the feeling of what it was like that night id love to have it back
5793571 offensively he and i worked really closely the pressure is hot right now weve been in the playoffs every year except for 2003 and i want the pressure to be on me not the kids we have some high profile kids and i want them to be kids and have fun with their teammates theres going to be a lot of pressure from the media the parents the community i want to be the guy that takes it on
5793572 as a sophomore he was a huge part of our state championship and going 14 0 he doesnt force things like a young quarterback would do he throws as good a ball as anybody weve ever had here hes unbelievable
5793573 ginos numbers speak for themselves he just moves really really well hes not the fastest guy on the field but he plays the fastest hes got a second gear when the ball is in the air williams is just incredibly talented he had 150 yards as a freshman in our state championship game he had two of the most high pressured catches you could have and hes still raw hes 15 years old hes still learning the position hes still learning how to play every day
5793574 it isnt about what jake heaps is going to do or what kasen is going to do or what gino simone is going to do
5793575 thats like taking away my child and taking away everything about her her in her own words
5793576 lets talk i hear that the flight will go faster if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger
5793577 a horse a cow and a deer all eat the same stuff but the deer excretes pellets the cow big patties and the horse clumps of dried grass why is that
5793578 donalds a young player thats shown great progress i like what he does in there and hes continuing to get better and as long as that happens i think hes going to stay there
5793579 we watched him and this guy has done a heck of a job i was impressed with what he did early in the game last week with his hands had a couple of pressures early on in the game
5793580 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
5793581 i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
5793582 im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either
5793583 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
5793584 once we were working it felt like a good fit
5793585 the cc gold coast builds upon the luxury sports coupe that debuted at the 2008 north american international auto show
5793586 weve added luxury and performance extras like tri coat paint high end interior appointments and ground affects that enhance the sportiness of our newest sedan
5793587 as with many other areas of his record scott garretts environmental record is simply shameful with 69 000 in contributions from big oil its no wonder he votes to protect the special interests instead of looking for new energy alternatives what i dont understand is scott garretts problem with clean drinking water and smog free air
5793588 if they were in the know they would have probably left it up but this happened before it was
5793589 i know from my own experience that it is difficult to maintain a professional and a social life and squeeze in staying fit
5793590 i was lucky to be able to afford a personal trainer but it was getting pretty expensive i thought no wonder women are so uninspired you either go to a gym full of sweaty blokes and tentatively ask the staff how to use a medicine ball or just muddle along by yourself before giving up
5793591 we wanted it to complement womens lifestyles not complicate them
5793592 the idea is that you can go anywhere in the world and access your training programme
5793593 and this allows you to work out what you want for lunch before you have even stepped out of the office
5793594 we know you like a drink and that from time to time you want to indulge in rich food and thats fine with us as long as you create a balance
5793595 finding the bloom of the cactus generation improving the quality of life for seniors
5793596 as im sure youre all aware foreign formats have increased in popularity as the basis for us television development and production what is often overlooked or not fully appreciated are the complexities associated with negotiating format deals coupled with the fact that often times what is appealing in the format may be nothing more than a general underlying premise which in and of itself may be no reason to license the underlying property
5793597 this recipe was an old time favorite from my family i had made some different variations using the tomatoes ham and basil this is great for a brunch or a light lunch with a delightful salad
5793598 optimus is my favorite character because its been so well received and its had such an effect on so many people
5793599 because of that i hold it closer than any other character ive done outside of maybe eeyore whos had a considerable effect on younger children too
5793600 i worked with michael a few weeks ago and we did some of the opening dialogue the opening speech and then a couple of scenes with shia labeouf shia wasnt there of course i just worked from the script
5793601 i only know the lines ive read and im not allowed to disclose any of those but the amount of success that transformers had on a financial level is providing a lot more screen time for optimus prime its very expensive to do all these robot characters because of the 10 000 moving parts
5793602 thankfully we were a hit so theres transformers 2 and maybe transformers 3 i think transformers 2 is going to be an incredible incredible picture i can see the excitement in the faces of the people involved and it generates quite a bit of excitement in me too
5793603 i told them that i would literally commit suicide if they made an action figure of me i will kill myself
5793604 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against
5793605 its a difficult time for france but the french have issued a statement saying they plan to stay the course in afghanistan
5793606 theirs was a sacrifice not just for france but for all of us who want to help the afghan people build a better future for themselves

5793611 a fun way to a fun way to make a living and you could travel around the world and people would pay you for that
5793612 if you didnt have it on in seven seconds then you would breathe the chemical weapons and you would die
5793613 the idea that i was willing to go to the war zone to do that for the sake of journalism seems a little crazy but it was really thrilling as a journalist in a moment of an extraordinary drama to feel like you are doing something important or at least something excited enough not to stop
5793614 they were very young and very simple and also in their own way extraordinarily honorable and very good people
5793615 you can understand what kind of kid it is who is going to try to take advantage of the opportunity they had very simple ideas about what the war in would be like and of course none of them matched their expectation
5793616 it means you are interested in the most extreme moments in human life because you see acts of great bravery acts of great weakness and evil and coward and you see all of these everyday its very intense like you are in a movie everything is dramatic as the best the novelist could create
5793617 war is weeks of mind numbing boredom separated by moments of sheer terror
5793618 you spend hours and hours sitting around waiting for something to happen and then you spend several minutes hoping that it would be over thats was exactly what it was like
5793619 being a war correspondent is a terrific experience and it really does teach you things you can never learn it in any other scenario but dont do it too long
5793620 you make the choice not based on your own wellbeing but make it based on their wellbeing otherwise you really need to get out of this business
5793621 if someone said that he doesnt want you to write about it you dont write about it
5793622 i didnt write i didnt write a word of it
5793623 i took way too many notes and it is probably the only reason i am still working because i always have details and those little details are so important because they are the things to define the difference between making the readers feel like they are in that place and even make them feel like they are the guy in the story
5793624 the best part of being a journalist is excitement detail drama and the ability basically just to be a visitor to someones life the worst part is probably you never get rich if you are ok with that then go into journalism if you want to get rich being a journalist is not a smart choice
5793625 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
5793626 despite the strong numbers the program is down 8 percent in total viewers and 12 percent in the demo from the 2004 athens games
5793627 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
5793628 what you do at home is much much more important than anything you can receive at the dentists office

5793630 sugar and most carbohydrates that are taken into the body are fermentable
5793631 phosphoric acid etches the tooth dissolving the tooth structure very similar to the way bacteria do even if oral health care is good

5793641 if you use the word reliable to describe his versatility i would say he is
5793642 he has played as a box to box midfielder he has played out wide and today he played as a fullback and every time he does very well i can remember the goal against new england and the goal against barcelona in a very difficult game so he has proved that he is a very versatile and reliable player and a great team player
5793643 it was really the old kick it as hard as you can hey i m a realist
5793644 that goal was encouraging at least i got to go forward

5793646 code pink at a mock war crimes tribunal in istanbul june 27 signed a declaration that the iraqi insurgency deserved the support of people everywhere who care for justice and freedom
5793647 we must begin by really standing with the iraqi people and defending their right to resist i can remain myself against all forms of violence and yet i cannot judge what someone has to do when pushed to the wall to protect all they love the iraqi people are fighting for their country to protect their families and to preserve all they love they are fighting for their lives and we are fighting for lies
5793648 sure why do we have bases in the middle east we totally violated the rights of that country why do we get to have bases in the middle east
5793649 barack obama has said he knows he needs to earn the trust of the military when he speaks before the veterans of foreign wars today he could take a giant step toward earning that trust by renouncing jodie evans and her bundled campaign dollars and denounce her support of the iraq insurgency
5793650 the rnc is to be commended for speaking out against evans we hope that they too will join the call for obama to renounce jodie evans
5793651 with household budgets feeling the squeeze it should be a source of some comfort to the trade that many regular wine drinkers will pause for thought before they cut back on wine purchases

5793653 the worst is yet to come in the u s
5793654 credit market turmoil has driven the u s into a recession and may topple some of the nations biggest banks said kenneth rogoff former chief economist at the international monetary fund
5793655 the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
5793656 the u s housing slump has triggered about 500 billion in credit market losses for banks globally and led to the collapse and sale of bear stearns cos the fifth largest u s securities firm bonds of regional banks such as national city corp and keycorp are under pressure on expectations of more fallout rogoff 55 said the government should nationalize fannie mae and freddie mac the nations biggest mortgage finance firms
5793657 freddie mac and fannie mae should have been closed down 10 years ago he said they need to be nationalized the equity holders should lose all their money probably we need to guarantee the bonds simply because the u s has led everyone into believing they would guarantee the bonds
5793658 banks repossessed almost three times as many u s homes in july as a year earlier and the number of properties at risk of foreclosure jumped 55 percent according to realtytrac inc an irvine california based seller of foreclosure data u s builders broke ground on the fewest houses in 17 years last month according to a bloomberg news survey
5793659 rogoff told a conference in singapore today that the credit crisis is likely to worsen and a large bank may fail reuters reported earlier he was the imfs chief economist from august 2001 to september 2003
5793660 like any shrinking industries we are going to see the exit of some major players rogoff told bloomberg declining to name the banks he expects to fail were really going to see a consolidation even among the major investment banks
5793661 the only way to put discipline into the system is to allow some companies to go bust rogoff said you cant just have an industry where they make giant profits or they get bailed out
5793662 it shouldnt come as a shock when mountainous option arm and alt a loans begin resetting and the second leg of the credit crisis begins alt a loans were given to borrowers with credit scores of between 620 and 700 and included the option of interest only loans option arms and no documentation loans that required little if any documentation for loan approval ninety percent of those that got an option arm in 2006 provided little or no documentation ninety percent and its estimated that only 60 of option arm borrowers make only minimum monthly payments others estimate that up to 80 say a borrower makes minimum payments on a 600 000 loan that loan could easily be a 750 000 loan within two years and were supposed to be shocked when this problem ends in the second credit crisis

5793698 we have yet to render a definitive opinion as to whether the teams of a professional sports league can be considered a single entity the characteristics that sports leagues generally exhibit make the determination difficult in some contexts a league seems more aptly described as a single entity immune from antitrust scrutiny while in others a league appears to be a joint venture between independently owned teams that is subject to review

5793716 being locked to government mandated business practices or chained to programming contract terms set by government arbiters could inflict more harm than good serving only to choke investment and shackling innovation for future generations

5793725 moodys currently maintains aa1 general obligation rating for the state of minnesota with a stable outlook the aa rating is based on the states low debt ratio sound proven economy basically strong industrial diversity and healthy demographics and improving balance these strengths are offset by the challenge of potential political gridlock preventing the legislature from reaching consensus towards budgets including a state government shutdown that occurred in 2005 for 13 days

5793756 are going to be the biggest releases of delphi and c in many years going back to the delphi 7 time frame
5793757 we think the packaged software industry and the line of business and client server area are very important parts of the software market and delphi and c builder are premier tools for these areas
5793758 weve gone through the products from top to bottom and unicode enabled everything
5793759 for us as a database vendor delphi 2009 is the most important new release since delphi 3 we are very excited about the full unicode support and the numerous changes to the data access layers naturally for a database product unicode was always important and we had to jump through a number of loops to support it delphi 2009 now fully implements this functionality at all levels from compiler to ide and allows us to provide complete support for unicode to our customers delphi 2009 is bringing codegear back to the top spot of rapid application development for anyone serious about internationally deployed database applications delphi 2009 is an absolute must
5793760 delphi 2009 will bring to us a new level of deployment using the new datasnap dbexpress framework now without dependence of com and unicode support we can deploy new concepts of client side applications and new clients in other languages we plan to deploy our erp system in all of latin america and the usa because today we deploy only in brazil
5793761 our goal as a combined company is to eliminate the development barriers between applications and databases
5793762 this release combines database architecture and design features from er studio with delphi and c builder to create the ultimate database application design and development solution the all new delphi and c builder architect editions

5793772 we are trying to understand the regulation of processes that are fundamental to normal cell development and health in humans
5793773 defective cilia are implicated in a wide range of serious illnesses such as polycystic kidney disease retinal degeneration and neurological disorders inappropriate activation of signaling molecules that normally reside at the primary cilium may lead to certain cancers
5793774 ciliogenesis is a fundamental process these structures are found in almost every type of human cell you can imagine
5793775 if we can ever design drugs that will restore the formation and function of cilia even in the presence of cep290 mutations then that would be one way to cure the defects that lead to ciliary diseases
5793776 the pika is the american wests canary in the coal mine
5793777 as temperatures rise pika populations at lower elevations are being driven to extinction pushing pikas further upslope until they have nowhere left to go
5793778 climate change is likely to drive a third of the worlds species to extinction worse its the species living on mountaintops which until now have been free from human impact that will be hardest hit
5793779 the american pika is an obvious example of such a species at considerable risk from climate change
5793780 not in the purview of the commission or department to effect
5793781 the california fish and game commissions attempt to bury its head in the sand rather than deal with the impact of global warming on wildlife is an embarrassment to our state which is a leader in climate policy
5793782 the commission is not allowed to abdicate its duty to protect californias plants animals and wild habitats and neither is the u s fish and wildlife service
5793783 i intend to campaign on trust i intend to be a prime minister that earns the trust of new zealanders and im going to keep that trust

5793794 i trust the philippines authorities will spare no effort in tracking the murderers of mr roxas and bringing them to trial
5793795 we clearly have seen a side of russia that we had hoped was a thing of the past and we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward
5793796 that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5793797 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
5793798 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
5793799 for the first time in memory europe is becoming a continent that is whole free and at peace
5793800 unfortunately russia has tended to view the expansion of freedom and democracy as a threat to its interests the opposite is true free and prosperous societies on russias borders will advance russias interests by serving as sources of stability and economic opportunity
5793801 now russia has put its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
5793802 in the days and weeks ahead the department of defense will reexamine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
5793803 many nights weve prayed with no proof anyone could hear in our hearts a hopeful song we barely understood
5793804 mrs eddy says whatever inspires with wisdom truth or love be it song sermon or science blesses the human family with crumbs of comfort from christs table feeding the hungry and giving living waters to the thirsty and today its all about this song for me
5793805 obviously well comment from a partisan point of view we will have a press conference and otherwise be available to the media to comment from our perspective
5793806 it is a historic reality that jerusalem and the entire land was originally intended to be a homeland for the jewish people
5793807 the palestinians should in fact have a place and opportunity to settle but it doesnt have to be in jerusalem
5793808 sometimes politicians get wrapped up in what we can achieve rather than what we should achieve
5793809 if someone has a bomb or a missile or a gun pointed within a few feet of me i would want them to be as far away as possible
5793810 you dont have to be a military genius or strategist to know this

5793819 im really disappointed there are a lot of people who are not here tonight but thanks to everyone who did make it
5793820 possible to bring back actors from the past and realistically put them in new films
5793821 yes theyre both happening and ive been writing on both and in addition to those scripts ive written a number of other things but i think the one that is set to go as soon as the financing falls into place is the jamaica project which is now called dancing mood the characters are black jamaicans in kingston in the early 60s
5793822 there is a bit of russian in all of us
5793823 this game was like a final for us aguero said
5793824 beating brazil is the best thing i missed many chances against netherlands in the earlier round and tuesday luckily for me i scored twice this time
5793825 i have always believed hes got great skill and talent i hope he plays the same in the final
5793826 los albicelestes on the scoreboard in the 53rd minute when he chested in a pass from angel di maria aguero scored again in the 58th minute finishing off a play from messi and ezequiel garay
5793827 it was the greatest game for everyone and fortunately we managed to win it said mascherano who plays for liverpool in england
5793828 it doesnt happen very often that you beat brazil 3 nil so we want to enjoy the moment we havent achieved anything yet but beating brazil with a result like this is wonderful its amazing because the last four times we played them it was not good for us
5793829 i can blow someones head off but i cant light a good cigar
5793830 for the sort of work that mi5 is doing not just in operations but in terms of technical support and linguistics the caliber of people is terribly important to its effectiveness
5793831 all were doing is making sure as a prospective employer were spreading our net as wide as possible to attract the best possible candidates who fully represent the diversity of u k society
5793832 if you have grown up as part of a minority community youre probably more used to fitting in and being inconspicuous
5793833 you have a distinct skill set that is of use
5793834 this wouldnt be happening if we didnt think they were taking some strenuous steps to move forward
5793835 what mi5 has realized is that if you refuse to employ gay people for decades it takes some time before a public message is received that signals thats no longer the case
5793836 in nearly 20 years in this business ive never heard sexual orientation mentioned at all in discussing recruitment policies or individuals including people whose homosexuality is a matter of virtual public record
5793837 jens background in developing and producing reality programming is incredibly diverse her relationships in the creative community run very deep and were excited for her to start developing all types of programming in the reality genre
5793838 this is such an awesome sponsor for our team at bristol
5793839 the television series knight rider is a show that everyone can get hooked on i think its really cool that nbc has chosen to reinvent the series for the fall line up the best part about the show was always the car kitt and this is amazing that i get to drive a version of kitt for the night race at bristol its every guys dream to feel like they are an action hero and i get to have that chance under the lights of bristol with our no 28 knight rider ford
5793840 the stealth look and feel of the car coupled with travis kvapil at the helm has us very excited about this race
5793841 this event exemplifies the adrenalin and action the knight rider series will deliver and illustrates the strength and compatibility of our sponsor partnership with ford
5793842 the ultimate game on the biggest game board you can imagine
5793843 could you post a short but complete program which demonstrates the problem
5793844 jannonce tous mes coll gues et aux partenaires du mus e andre sakharov et du centre sakharov que je cesse de travailler pour le mus e le centre et la fondation sakharov et que je les quitte de ma propre volont
5793845 its not like we would ever who would you get thats better
5793846 i mean with chucky so much of it and david and i talk about this a lot that because hes a puppet theres an aspect of him that feels like hes an animated character so his voice is such an immense part of it as well as what he looks like
5793847 i think what we are mainly responding to david and i is the will of the fans which is really telling us that they want to see a scary chucky movie again they want to go back to the straightforward horror rather than the horror comedy
5793848 there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
5793849 it is a fallacy to say there is a limit to tax rates and it is a fallacy to rely mainly on individual free enterprise to get the savings
5793850 we wanted to give television fans an interactive experience for this years emmy show and what could be better than to ask them to weigh in on what are televisions most memorable moments its a perfect opportunity both to celebrate the history of television and at the same time to introduce new generations to some of the mediums most important events
5793851 the medias images of brad and angelina are smelly and vile and i must always attack the medias representation of what is good or cool
5793852 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5793853 more than 20 dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
5793854 the price must be maintained at a level close to 100 dollars because the costs have increased
5793855 i have to admit that you do sloth like nobodys business
5793856 i just sic them on punks like that like a couple of pitbulls

5793862 i was just saying thats amazing three runners in the final
5793863 its going to make the final a little bit less nerve wracking to see friends everywhere on the track im just so proud of us i think we are making a statement and im so happy to be a part of it
5793864 but he sure could tell a hell of a story
5793865 for a guy with a chip on his shoulder who spent his entire adult life trying to prove what a man he was that ernest hemingway sure could write a pretty good story
5793866 and yet despite all of these flaws theres something compelling about these tales of rousing adventure
5793867 yet another guy who doesnt get it oh well at least frazetta liked him
5793868 super ils auront pas besoin de la refaire cest une prise parfaite

5793889 we have had complaints about connectivity in the netherlands but have not had more complaints than usual for a 3g phone in germany our technicians said today apple has issued a software update but it is too early to tell if the problems are solved
5793890 these clarifications will eliminate existing redundant sub requirements while improving scoping and reporting requirements when version 1 2 is released incorporating existing best practices supporting documents will also be updated and consolidated

5793892 theres been a suggestion that theyve been in the vicinity on and off for a couple of weeks but certainly no ones been seen sleeping in the bin or actually living in it
5793893 when police investigated they found a few bedding items and living items its a bit hard to draw a conclusion
5793894 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5793895 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5793896 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5793897 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5793898 there were very violent battles that lasted several hours and an operation is still ongoing in the zone
5793899 these soldiers were doing their duty but they did not die for france they died in an unending war that the united states is waging in that country for its own interests
5793900 thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
5793901 the swearing in would take place on monday or tuesday to enable new legislators to execute the mandate they were given by the people
5793902 the preparations for the swearing in of members of the seventh parliament since independence are at an advanced stage
5793903 oh my gosh i didnt even think that was possible
5793904 the widening credit quality spreads in the money and bond markets is certainly unsettling
5793905 the market has handled bad news well for the past few weeks which could indicate that investors are beginning to look out into the future
5793906 for now though traders are back to the present and worried about the here and now we could get a test of the recent lows over the next few weeks
5793907 the us indicators today carry a strong flavour of stagflation
5793908 this is the biggest sporting event in the world and you feel special to be in something so important
5793909 tennis is my life but it certainly cant be easy to work with me because i can be really stubborn
5793910 i really want to place in the top 30 in the world rankings

5793912 i really wanted to be standing on the podium now i have nothing to take home except my pride
5793913 he didnt kiss me until the last day of the olympic games
5793914 i dont think that this has to come out in public
5793915 i spoke with my girlfriend and she didnt want this exposed either because then we would both just have to talk about our relationship and not about our tennis anymore

5793919 studies show that its done by a very small proportion of people and of the people who litter high proportions can be persuaded to change their ways and thats what gives me hope
5793920 appreciation and self love are the most important tools that you could ever nurture appreciation of others and the appreciation of yourself is the closest vibrational match to your source energy of anything that weve ever witnessed anywhere in the universe

5793930 good manufacturing practice gmp is a regulatory guideline imposed on all manufacturers of pharmaceuticals to ensure that finished products have the identity strength quality and purity they are required to have
5793931 significant deficiencies were found in the operations of your firms quality control unit and as a result there is no assurance that many drug products manufactured and released into interstate commerce by your firm have the identity strength quality and purity that they purport to possess
5793932 our investigators observed numerous instances where your firms quality control unit either ignored or failed to recognize that some tablets that did not meet in process specifications
5793933 w e are concerned about the quality of drug products that have been released from your facility under the serious lack of cgmp controls found during the inspection
5793934 its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those lines should be crossed but when you cross those lines you put yourself in position for things like this to happen
5793935 everybody is scared its not normal to not be scared
5793936 but im not scared as much now i have letters and other things from people telling me how ive helped so many people in numerous ways that makes me feel good
5793937 i just want to say thanks to the people for keeping me going
5793938 all them little cards and stuff i got keeps me going day by day to know im going downhill a little bit it doesnt bother me because ive helped so many people since ive helped so many people this is easier to handle
5793939 life aint about how many breaths you take its what you do with those breaths
5793940 we would get things in the mail almost every day from people all over the country
5793941 people would sometimes call too just wanting to talk to him
5793942 some wanted to come meet him it was amazing i guess he touched so many people we were in the airport at newark n j and people were coming up to him because they recognized him
5793943 he said to them you never know what life might bring you you might have a few sniffles and think its not a big thing then you go to the doctor the next day and they tell you that you have a 10 pound tumor in your stomach
5793944 their manager joe maddon called and said he saw the story on john on espn and he was just in his hotel room in tears
5793945 it was a good time because we both got to experience it and it felt like something not just for me but something he enjoyed as well
5793946 the first time she was here john said i know why youre here
5793947 i really cant explain how his story took off but the kid was just unbelievable
5793948 his attitude and messages i think changed how some people looked at their lives he changed how i went about life
5793949 i feel like a piece of my heart is gone now the thing ill miss most is his smile he had a smile that could light up a room
5793950 i could see people having some beers and hopefully remembering how i always tried my best no matter what i was doing thats my message just for people to always do their best no matter what theyre doing or how stupid it might seem and no matter what there will always be a reward no matter how small it is
5793951 those occasions in which talk revolves around a piece of writing have been termed literacy events
5793952 the child must know not only how to read but also how and when to talk about what he or someone else has read
5793953 the point here is that in order to understand literacy it is important to examine particular events where reading and writing are used focusing on the particular is an integral part of an ecological approach this is different from other approaches which place an emphasis on broad generalizations
5793954 the specific recipe for success was low levels of investment per cow a very good marketing of the calves that they raised and the culled cows that they sold and a tight control on their annual expenses
5793955 success wasnt due to region of the country it wasnt due to age of operator none of the kind of factors that we thought might make a difference
5793956 im going to have the best boobs in the nursing home im going to be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5793957 but sometimes you have to feel it like in star wars when luke flies a plane well the plane is telling me that its going to get much worse
5793958 we are coaching him and giving him the support to come back
5793959 its behind us and we are all looking forward i think its horrible what he has to go through but he is doing a nice job of maintaining and getting ready for his next opportunity at the same time im sure there is a frustration there and a realization that hes going to miss a lot at times its hard for him to come to grips with it
5793960 there were a lot of hard nights and tough days
5793961 but with my family and the coaching staff all around there was support from every angle it was easy falling in and doing what i need to do for the future
5793962 hes focused with his enthusiasm its all you can ask of him i feel bad for the kid we had a talk at the beginning of camp and he has been better after that
5793963 my motivation is november when i come back step on the field and finish strong
5793964 its very frustrating theres nothing else i can do but just get better just because im not going to play against stanford im not going to take plays off or not go as hard no matter what its just personal for me
5793965 its obvious we have to prepare others who are going to play thats a long time into the year at the same hes getting the opportunity through the individual drills to be ready
5793966 i just want to get on the field make some statements and come out strong
5793967 its time to press the iraqis to take responsibility for their future
5793968 the best way to do that is a responsible redeployment of our combat brigades carried out in close consultation with commanders on the ground we can safely redeploy at a pace that removes our combat brigades in 16 months that would be well into 2010 seven years after the war began after this redeployment well keep a residual force to target remnants of al qaeda to protect our service members and diplomats and to train iraqs security forces if the iraqis make political progress
5793969 my father left when i was 2 so my grandfather was the man who helped raise me he grew up in el dorado kansas a town too small to warrant boldface on a road map he worked on oil rigs and drifted from town to town during the depression then he met my grandmother and enlisted after pearl harbor he would go on to march across europe in pattons army while my great uncle fought with the 89th infantry division to liberate buchenwald my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line and my mother was born at fort leavenworth after my grandfather left the army he went to college on the gi bill bought his home with help from the federal housing authority and he and my grandmother moved west in a restless pursuit of their dreams
5793970 when you help others you help yourself its an exhilarating and gratifying experience to mingle with patients and visitors to listen to them give words of encouragement and help where i can
5793971 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5793972 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5793973 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5793974 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5793975 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5793976 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5793977 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5793978 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5793979 we really want to get the message out to people
5793980 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5793981 who is supposed to be more on top of financial things than a bank but banks made all these terrible mortgage loans and caused these disruptions and we are dependent on them for our financial security
5793982 i want to be that 1 5 quick ebay store fixes
5793983 my belief is that people dont join the military for overt political reasons
5793984 as much as possible we need to check party politics at the door
5793985 we dont look at parties we look at individual legislators
5793986 i think this has been very healthy for the democratic party
5793987 theres a lot of lip service being given to veterans
5793988 this is a real opportunity to get things going in a real positive way
5793989 he made a vow to make this happen and he made this happen
5793990 uncomfortable with switching over from state parity formula to export parity model
5793991 the views of oil companies on the chaturvedi committee report have been discussed they will submit it to us in writing these will be taken up in due course
5793992 we are only requesting that mechanism should be such that is acceptable and equitable
5793993 priced in a consistent manner under a long term policy
5793994 it is also essential that economic pricing is blended with social responsibility so that the oil sector continues to function and service the oil needs of the economy
5793995 smashing telly is a hand edited collection of the best free instantly available tv on the web
5793996 all of this activity creates opportunities and strengthens the aftermarket position the impact of these cases and changes turn on the strength of the oem patents some of which may be 98 pound weaklings

5794000 i express images formed in my mind based on things seen around me rather than trying to reproduce things that are observed
5794001 i do not copy pictures by others or copy photographs i strive to form unified spatial line shape and color elements in my work i try to evaluate first efforts with a subject and then i try to solve problem parts in a new and hopefully improved version
5794002 indeed throughout my adult life i have been involved with visual art as a teacher and as an artist
5794003 i owe much to my wife marianne for all of her support and encouragement over the years
5794004 throughout his career he has proven to be a strong advocate for students our colleges greatest commodity
5794005 we are pleased to see kensington continue the innovation of wireless usb products with the introduction of a wireless usb docking station
5794006 this solution provides a new usage scenario that supports workstation functionality while enhancing consumers need for convenience productivity and mobility in the home or office environment
5794007 our entire smart made simple design philosophy is about giving users the easiest most intuitive computing experience
5794008 were especially proud to be the first to introduce a universal wireless docking station because nothing could be easier or more intuitive than having your accessories spring to life as you approach them with your notebook we know that wireless usb notebook users are extremely busy mobile professionals who appreciate every efficiency they can gain so they can stay productive at all times
5794009 as an early adopter of wireless usb technology dell now offers it as an option on several consumer and commercial notebooks and mobile workstations
5794010 the advent of complementary products like the wireless usb docking station from kensington not only contributes to a clean clutter free desktop but further enhances mobility and productivity
5794011 this one being the first photo of him with all eight medals we hope that our cover will stick in everyones mind
5794012 a first i must say felt a bit like elizabeth taylor
5794013 some of my plans and schemes have had to be put on hold because there is not much i can do if i cant walk properly
5794014 the surgery went as planned and annie is now recuperating at home annie would like to send her thanks and appreciation to all that have sent their well wishes in the past few days
5794015 for the consumer at the end of the day what really matters is what can i do with the phone
5794016 if android allows you to do things you cant do otherwise and its better then consumers will start to say i know what this is and i want it thats going to be hard to get to that point
5794017 to me the key variable is really not so much android its your big mobile phone operators that command most of the market share and how are they going to act and react
5794018 i think the idea behind android is a good one the idea of having an open platform but at the same time phones are different from computers most people dont realize their phone has an os on it much less care about what os it has
5794019 really the success of a platform boils down to the developers
5794020 when youre sitting at zero handsets developers have to make their bets
5794021 one would think that google with their very broad reach and very good branding would be at lots of advantages with respect to distribution their open nature might mean they have a pretty good rev share model in place for the developers
5794022 i think a lot of the developers are betting that its worth playing with the android platform
5794023 it may as well be the only phone in the world if youre google youve got to match that and if not do better be cheaper one or the other
5794024 joe still hasnt returned my call are you even doing your job
5794025 i put on my preschool manners basically by lowering my voice they have to really listen to hear me and they usually end up matching my tone
5794026 thank you for calling this is not for us but i wish you the best of luck
5794027 az ember boldogs ga bizonyos m rt kig mindig kiszolg ltatottja a vakv letlen szesz ly nek
5794028 well i started up the lane again and i turned to look at this again and when it did a human voice just as audible as mine is said dont you never drink smoke or defile your body in any way therellbeaworkfor you to do when you get older why it liked to scared me to death
5794029 as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of the lord jesus christ so you are sent to forerun his second coming
5794030 now im just your brother by the grace of god but when the angel of the lord moves down it becomes then a voice of god to you but i am gods voice to you now see i can say nothing in myself but what he shows me
5794031 jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming would be completed i sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and usher in the millennium
5794032 but i remember when my fathers still up there running i had to be out there with water and stuff see young ladies that wasnt over seventeen eighteen years up there with a man my age now drunk and theyd have to sober them up and give them black coffee to get them home to cook their husbands supper oh something like that i said i this was my remarked sic then theyre not worth a good clean bullet to kill them with it thats right and i hated women thats right and i just have to watch every move now to keep from still thinking the same thing
5794033 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord
5794034 i saw seven angels in the form of a pyramid that swept down picked me up and was brought east to open the seven seals of god
5794035 1 then i saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals
5794036 who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll
5794037 do not weep see the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has triumphed he is able to open the scroll and its seven seals
5794038 there never was in the age any two major prophets on the earth at one time there were many minor prophets but there were one major prophet and elijah was the prophet until elisha came then when elijah was taking off a portion double portion of elijahs spirit elijahs spirit came upon elisha
5794039 god always deals with one individual two mens got two ideas there never was two major prophets on the earth prophesying the same time look back and see if there was no sir too much scrupled up hes got to get one man completely surrendered and use that person he searches for that person but there will be one sometime somebody wholl listen to him word by word
5794040 now haggai the prophet and zechariah the prophet a descendant of iddo prophesied to the jews in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel who was over them then zerubbabel son of shealtiel and jeshua son of jozadakset to work to rebuild the house of god in jerusalem and the prophets of god were withthem helping them
5794041 now you cannot be omnipresent without being omniscient gods not even omnipresent gods omniscient omniscient which means makes him omnipresent he knows all things but in order to be a being he has to be in one being
5794042 hes god hes infinite and omnipresent omniscient therefore he knows all things he cant be present everywhere by being omniscient knowing all things then he can be present everywhere
5794043 am i a god at hand saith the lord and not a god afar off can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see him do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord
5794044 the man the body was not deity but deity was in the body
5794045 jesus was not god but he was god he was a man yet he was god he could cry and yet he could raise the dead he could cry for a man being dead and raise him back up again he was jehovah jireh jehovah rapha jehovah manasses he was jehovah all completely he was jehovah and yet he was a man
5794046 he was he was jesus when he was born but when the holy ghost came upon him after his baptism he was anointed with god god was in him cause he come to fulfill the word
5794047 and this little boy twelve year old child no wisdom at all why but just a twelve year old boy the father didnt dwell in him at that time because he come on the day when he baptized him he saw the spirit of god coming down see and went in him
5794048 the spirit left jesus in gethsemane and he became just a man when god looked down upon the body the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane he had to die a man
5794049 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
5794050 and i still in my the two consciences together i knew i was standing here and i knew i was somewhere else
5794051 now this is a vision and i must learn what this means
5794052 in december 1962 god gave william branham a vision of an angelic visitation which he foretold in a message
5794053 in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
5794054 but a tritheist triune baptism was never recognized in the church the new testament now you know what to do thats right and if you refuse to walk in light when lights brought forth you turn to darkness right amen
5794055 well brother branham i spoke in tongues i shouted i did this
5794056 ubuntu has a huge user base and substantial community support around the world we think the passion these users have for linux and the open source movement generally will be important in helping the linux foundation to accelerate the uptake of linux in organizations of all size
5794057 so it seemed logical for us to join the other major vendors supporting the linux foundation at this time
5794058 even though canonical and ubuntu have been participating in our activities for the last few years the direct association with them means well have closer coordination across their organization it also means they see enough value in what we do to financially support it
5794059 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5794060 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5794061 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5794062 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5794063 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5794064 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5794065 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5794066 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5794067 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5794068 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5794069 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5794070 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5794071 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5794072 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5794073 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5794074 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5794075 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5794076 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5794077 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5794078 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5794079 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5794080 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5794081 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5794082 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5794083 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5794084 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5794085 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5794086 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5794087 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5794088 remember too that a lot of large businesses especially the ones taking advantage of the weak dollar are doing well in spite of the media coverage of the poor performers
5794089 n condi iile n care foarte multe spitale se zbat n mizerie i s r cie lucie iar oamenii vin de acas cu medicamente s promi i cre terea salariilor medicilor din banii care mai r m n n spitale este o prostie un lucru f r leg tur cu realitatea n plus modul n care au fost stabilite criteriile de recompensare poate mbun t i activitatea unui cap nu a unui spital
5794090 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5794091 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5794092 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5794093 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5794094 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5794095 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5794096 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5794097 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5794098 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5794099 wij bekampten een terroristische organisatie de sjiitische hezbollah en geen staat maar indien libanon een hezbollahstaat zou worden leggen wij ons geen enkele beperking op
5794100 het is evident dat deze datum van 7 september die de curatoren ons gaven afhangt van het goede verloop van het financieel plan dat ze hebben opgesteld
5794101 we hebben een uitgebreid onderzoek verricht en we zijn er zeker van dat het niet de schuld van het restaurant is
5794102 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5794103 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5794104 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5794105 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5794106 and what would the amazing race be without a pair of blondes
5794107 uitvoering van het zespuntenplan omtrent een bestand dringend uitgevoerd moet worden
5794108 met uitzondering van een effectief van 500 manchappen die bijkomende maatregelen
5794109 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5794110 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5794111 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5794112 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5794113 when we show our body without prudence without modesty we are prostituting ourselves
5794114 it gives rapists permission to say well she had on a miniskirt
5794115 what the church says has credibility thats why this type of statement is so dangerous
5794116 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5794117 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5794118 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5794119 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5794120 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5794121 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5794122 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5794123 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5794124 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5794125 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5794126 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5794127 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5794128 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5794129 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5794130 who are open to doing something on the production side
5794131 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5794132 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5794133 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5794134 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5794135 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5794136 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5794137 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5794138 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5794139 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5794140 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5794141 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5794142 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5794143 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5794144 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5794145 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5794146 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5794147 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5794148 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5794149 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5794150 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5794151 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5794152 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5794153 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5794154 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

5794174 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5794175 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5794176 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5794177 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5794178 there were very violent battles that lasted several hours and an operation is still ongoing in the zone
5794179 these soldiers were doing their duty but they did not die for france they died in an unending war that the united states is waging in that country for its own interests
5794180 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5794181 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5794182 a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a trans atlantic future is unacceptable

5794188 the more leaves earned by treewala players the more trees we can plant
5794189 we call that a breath of fresh air as you can tell by our first initiative greenwala takes a seriously light hearted approach to going green we believe we can reach more people and inspire them to shift their attitudes and behaviors through our social community model people want to know how they can help and they do not have to live off the grid in order to make a difference
5794190 giving the same importance to paper as we do to the food we eat or the clothes we buy the goal of the story campaign is to get people thinking about the journey of a single sheet of paper where the journey begins and the sustainability and environmental practices of its manufacturer
5794191 as a leading paper manufacturer in the u s and canada we feel its the responsibility of newpage to dramatically raise awareness of the potential hidden risks associated with some asian imports a failure to ask some basic questions of your suppliers can lead to the very real potential that you are unknowingly importing a fair amount of risk along with your paper
5794192 just like educating consumers on the manufacturing source of paper products someday well be able to know the fertilizer that was used to feed the grass that fed the cows that fed your guests at your summer barbeque the supply chain impact will become a competitive advantage

5794198 more than 20 dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
5794199 the price must be maintained at a level close to 100 dollars because the costs have increased
5794200 given the movement of the dollar the renminbi hasnt appreciated as dramatically as significantly as against some other currencies like the euro and the yen
5794201 and so i think one of the things weve tried to do and weve done with some success is encourage other countries to speak about this topic and to engage with the chinese very directly on it
5794202 theres a lot of us investment in china and to get the protections that our investors need is something thats important and difficult to do on the other hand theres very little investment that the chinese have in the us and we think it would be a positive for both of our countries to have them have more investment in the us
5794203 the chinese sometimes question whether their investment is welcome here
5794204 i didnt care so much about the score during the diving in the end i knew i had probably won
5794205 this gold has a different meaning i have always made little mistakes and been nervous in big events but this time i controlled myself better and did what my coaches wanted me to do
5794206 when i was young my condition was not very good in the platform i could not perform very well and i changed coaches many times

5794212 henrik larsson is still a great player he is probably the best player in the swedish league he is a very strong player
5794213 we all expect a very good match an open game but of course france are a world class nation we are strong at home i think it will be a very tight game
5794214 as he henry is here and pat patrick viera injured isnt thierry has all the qualities and skills to be captain but in the future that remains to be seen

5794229 it is clear that regulations need to be set down to ensure that crisis pregnancy counselling is carried out in an ethical honest and compassionate way
5794230 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5794231 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
5794232 since women having abortions can no longer be said to have a low risk of suffering from psychiatric conditions such as depression doctors have a duty to advise about long term adverse psychological consequences of abortion
5794233 we now know that abortion leads to depression and mental health problems in later life along with other complications in future pregnancies
5794234 abortion research is highly politicised but large high quality studies consistently show that having an abortion does not result in psychological damage
5794235 if this rehashed inconclusive and dated research is being used to deny women in the uk who seek an abortion the right to counselling then its a fairly desperate act on behalf of the abortion industry and those who wish to deny women the right to make a fully informed decision
5794236 if you can take out one factor that will stop that person being reassaulted you should have the ability to ban alcohol for those type of people
5794237 the crown are very supportive of this at the moment we may seek for it to be widened out to other offences
5794238 we are always concerned when people try to link alcohol as a causal factor of domestic abuse but theres no doubt in terms of reports to the police alcohol is a trigger point for incidents of violence
5794239 it is an interesting concept but the idea is unworkable and it would be impossible to police
5794240 the concept that men only abuse their partners when they are drunk is nonsense how does that account for all the cases where alcohol is not involved
5794241 domestic abuse is a very complex thing and to focus on alcohol is very unhelpful
5794242 anything that deters an abuser from committing an act of violence or abuse towards an ex spouse has to be welcomed
5794243 but the difficulty i have with this is how do you police it alcohol only stays in the system for a relatively short period
5794244 i would also have concerns as bail conditions only last as long as the case is outstanding as soon as the trial begins the conditions fall
5794245 the alcohol problem may well be long standing and will need long standing solutions a bail order on its own will do little to tackle the problem there also needs to be help to tackle the alcohol addiction
5794246 i can confirm that a proposal from the police is under discussion

5794264 we bumped into each other in a coffee shop and we talked about the groups we were in at the time and how things werent really going the way we wanted them to go
5794265 we started hanging out and before long the guitars came out and we started jamming
5794266 from the first demos that we did people were interested and the tapes got passed around before we knew it we were signed and the album was done its just been a whirlwind really

5794540 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form
5794541 this resulted in severe oxidative stress and increased tissue damage as measured by oxidized dna
5794542 these higher levels of oxidative stress and damage are likely to predispose smokers with mycoplasma infections to lung disease such as copd or cancer
5794543 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
5794544 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
5794545 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
5794546 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
5794547 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
5794548 kids enjoyed them its one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do
5794549 so much of how you teach depends on how you market the material presentation is very important to kids
5794550 many of these students had never used a calculator before so it added a fun aspect to math class for them
5794551 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
5794552 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
5794553 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behavior

5794596 we just kind of felt like in news reports lately it was like what are we going to do with them trying to sweep them under the rug
5794597 we thought we could help some of denvers homeless residents by giving them a fresh look giving them real good self esteem and helping them feel part of the dnc so they look their best
5794598 i mean the homeless have enough to worry about without being in last season
5794599 as a director i really love it its easier shooting on location because it helps me remove myself from my normal life as a producer which i am on this its more difficult because you dont know the area and you have to hire people youve never worked with before

5794606 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5794607 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5794608 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5794609 there can be no business as normal under the current circumstances
5794610 this still hasnt happened every day several episodes still occur when our servicemen detain georgian troops

5794618 there is one way and only one way to make it as a dancer train harder than anyone else if there isnt any good training in your area find it it takes time to get your body that versatile and controlled however being trained technically is not necessarily the answer if you can discipline yourself then first seek out your biggest inspirations whether it be music videos movies instructional tapes b boy event tapes old swing dance footage some guy you saw dancing on the street whatever it is seize it and juice it for all its creative influence on you next commit all your time to practicing or working with that person or perfecting the moves or going to the clubs where the people get down when you train hard you gotta train hard you dont stop when you get it you do it better you dont stop when you get the trick you evolve the trick into a better trick you dance until you throw up nothing less that is how you build super endurance there is no excuse it is up to you do you wanna make money dancing for the rest of your life well so do alot of other people all you have to ask yourself is are you willing to practice harder and longer than them
5794619 we learned that even though we were using the same molecule all were composed of molybdenum and sulfur size and structure is important in determining reactivity
5794620 the most reactive nanocluster of those that we tested had six atoms of molybdenum and eight atoms of sulfur it readily absorbed sulfur and let go of carbon monoxide which makes it an effective catalyst

5794622 a very powerful flashlight directed at the moon would theoretically create a bright spot on its surface by simply turning the flashlight sideways the flashlights beam streaks across the sky at speeds far exceeding the speed of light this evidence has long been known and dismissed since the bright spot cannot be used for superluminal or faster than light communication between the earth and the moon the fast motion of the bright spot is simply a geometrical artifact similar in some ways to the point at which the two blades of closing scissors intersect the theory of relativity does not concern such purely geometrical objects
5794623 you may have noticed that we started running a test of display ads on select pages of the youtube mobile site in the u s and japan
5794624 this is our first step in testing mobile advertising for youtube it will give you a new way to interact with content on the go while allowing us to learn how video viewers engage with mobile advertising our test advertisers will also have an additional branding tool at their disposal and the opportunity to reach the millions of people who visit youtube every day on their phones
5794625 theyre being aggressive because theyre looking for the killer app for video ads theyre just trying a lot of different things this is the newest trial
5794626 the problem is that the screen size on a mobile device is going to kill google
5794627 theyre still struggling with finding a way to make video ads work on a pc size screen now theyre saying they need to test what will work on a small screen its an added degree of difficulty all of the challenges facing the monetization of video on the pc are just exacerbated on the mobile device
5794628 at youtube we are constantly testing new ways to deliver the kinds of ads that contribute to the user experience while making the most sense for advertisers and weve learned a lot about what works for youtube and what doesnt
5794629 for the consumer at the end of the day what really matters is what can i do with the phone
5794630 if android allows you to do things you cant do otherwise and its better then consumers will start to say i know what this is and i want it thats going to be hard to get to that point
5794631 to me the key variable is really not so much android its your big mobile phone operators that command most of the market share and how are they going to act and react
5794632 i think the idea behind android is a good one the idea of having an open platform but at the same time phones are different from computers most people dont realize their phone has an os on it much less care about what os it has
5794633 really the success of a platform boils down to the developers
5794634 when youre sitting at zero handsets developers have to make their bets
5794635 one would think that google with their very broad reach and very good branding would be at lots of advantages with respect to distribution their open nature might mean they have a pretty good rev share model in place for the developers
5794636 i think a lot of the developers are betting that its worth playing with the android platform
5794637 it may as well be the only phone in the world if youre google youve got to match that and if not do better be cheaper one or the other
5794638 ubuntu has a huge user base and substantial community support around the world we think the passion these users have for linux and the open source movement generally will be important in helping the linux foundation to accelerate the uptake of linux in organizations of all size
5794639 so it seemed logical for us to join the other major vendors supporting the linux foundation at this time
5794640 even though canonical and ubuntu have been participating in our activities for the last few years the direct association with them means well have closer coordination across their organization it also means they see enough value in what we do to financially support it
5794641 it is a joy to remember my daughter in a way that supports my enduring goal of creating a level playing field for the education of all students regardless of their background
5794642 in making this donation i also think of my father who became director of the mackay school of mines in reno nv and was entrusted with large grants as the metallurgy field expanded in the 1920s just as nanotechnology is revolutionizing the worlds of science and engineering today education is the key to developing the full potential of nanotechnology and i am pleased to support a graduate student in this exciting and important field
5794643 we are grateful to dr belz for her generous donation to establish a new endowment at ualbanys college of nanoscale science and engineering
5794644 by honoring the memory of her daughter in this way dr belz is demonstrating her belief in the importance of providing exceptional higher education while also creating a lasting legacy of support for students exploring scientific fields that have the power to positively impact our society
5794645 i am truly honored and humbled that dr belz has chosen to pay tribute to her daughter by establishing a graduate fellowship at the ualbany nanocollege
5794646 this gift will provide critical support for the pioneering educational curriculum and unmatched research programs available at cnse while also ensuring that the best and brightest students have access to cutting edge scientific know how that is vital to their careers and to further growth at cnse the university and throughout new york state
5794647 we are most appreciative to dr belz for this generous donation which truly reflects both her lifelong love of education and her commitment to providing exciting opportunities for all students
5794648 this gift represents an investment in the world class educational and research programs at ualbanys college of nanoscale science and engineering and assists in ensuring that our students will be exceptionally well prepared for the scientific careers of the 21st century
5794649 structure is highly conserved capturing information that is evolutionarily deep
5794650 it was only logical to focus on transfer rna a molecule that is believed to be very ancient and is truly central to the entire protein synthesis machinery
5794651 our findings uniquely focus on structure the actual aspect of the molecule that encases its function
5794652 for the first time we believe we make this distinction between the evolution of the genetic code codon discovery and the evolution of amino acid charging
5794653 we are working at the ultimate edge of what is possible progressing toward advanced next generation semiconductor technologies
5794654 this new development is a critical achievement in the pursuit to continually drive miniaturization in microelectronics
5794655 the science of nanopores is complex and challenging we are very proud to have gathered a world class panel of experts from leading institutions in this field
5794656 our relationships with the advisory board members extend beyond pure technical advice our support of research in the laboratories will further the science of nanopores oxford nanopore now has the worlds best advisors and an excellent in house development team of scientists and engineers we are in a unique position to develop an early to market sequencing technology and improved versions in the future a label free approach to dna sequencing would facilitate a transformation in genomics that could be likened to the broadband revolution
5794657 our partnership with cimac has been both cost effective and efficient
5794658 weve been able to put our efforts toward our core competencies of pvd cluster tools and let cimac enhance the product lines with their expertise in software
5794659 this is a perfect example of our value added service
5794660 for over 10 years we have been partnering with equipment suppliers to enhance the productivity of their current generation tools and to bring to market new tools with state of the art software capabilities
5794661 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
5794662 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
5794663 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease
5794664 this implies that the loop has some importance perhaps in regulation of atp7bs activities and we intend to follow up on this in our future studies

5794677 through data center consolidation and virtualization end users are trying to improve the utilization of hardware and lower the cost
5794678 we enable the consolidation to happen much faster because when you consolidate servers into one platform the amount of memory in the platform has to double or quadruple in order for you to enable the consolidation
5794679 we believe that ddr3 registered dimms dual in line memory module are going to be a significant portion of the server market
5794680 registered dimms are a much low power solution for servers while fully buffered dimms will have a place in the market registered dimms are more suited for the high end of the market especially with the four and eight socket systems we also think the makers of two socket systems will also adopt registered dimms

5794697 martin had gone to the taxi rank and was asked for a cigarette
5794698 he said no and they just launched into him it was three on one he had no chance
5794699 we have just bought a house and we are doing it up we were going to do the wallpapering on saturday so martin had stopped drinking early because he wanted to be ready to get started the next morning
5794700 he came home in a taxi and came straight to the bedroom he was unsteady on his feet and the right side of his face was covered in blood he was crying and not making any sense
5794701 i called his friend who is a nurse who tended his wounds but he just deteriorated i thought he had fallen asleep and tried to wake him but he got agitated and shouted please get off me and leave me alone
5794702 he is very very poorly and fighting for his life he is in a drug induced coma and has swelling in his brain
5794703 i am devastated martin is really popular very loyal and outgoing we have a big group of friends and we had been looking forward to getting the house ready together
5794704 as soon as i wake up i go to see him
5794705 i am there from nine in the morning until nine at night just to be with him he is my main priority nothing else is as important as him until he gets better and also afterwards when i will look after him
5794706 whoever did it has to hand themselves in they cant get away with it and think nothing serious has happened his family is distraught he is the best person i know
5794707 many witnesses have been coming forward but i dont think the offenders realise the seriousness of their actions
5794708 at the moment martins family is distraught by what has happened but luckily martin is fighting hard

5794738 it must respect prior rights and marks it mustnt be confusingly similar to any existing tld for example a kom would be too close to a com if it represents a community it must be with the full agreement of that community and it must respect morality and public order
5794739 icann intends to use auctions in the new gtld process as a tie breaking mechanism not the primary allocation mechanism for the resolution of string contention among competing new gtld applicants for identical or similar strings
5794740 auction would be the final means of settling any contention cases that have not been resolved at any of the previous stages in the process
5794741 on balance the economic arguments favour the use of auctions in some form where scarcity exists in relation to the goals set by icann for allocation procedures
5794742 they are particularly strong in relation to allocation decisions concerning to existing resources and where a tie breaker is needed during a comparative selection procedure for a new resource in all cases the best elements of comparative selection procedures could still be incorporated at a prequalification stage for registries using straightforward transparent and objective procedures that preserve the stability of the internet
5794743 auctions are well suited to accomplishing the goal of allocative efficiency putting scarce resources into the hands of those who value them the most

5794791 to me 3 feet high and rising epitomizes what a hip hop album can be funny creative funky political dirty and way out there the only rules are the ones you put on yourself
5794792 when it came to following rules de la soul usually said
5794793 oh shit thats the record i heard on the fresh party
5794794 they look kind of weird but fuck it i trust them because plug tunin was dope
5794795 damn theyre not using the typical samples that other people are using
5794796 great job and thanks tss for inviting me to participate in this article glad that i could offer my insight
5794797 if the police hadnt stepped in i fear what might have happened
5794798 something odd is happening like a shadow on the wall we dont know if its real or illusion we just know its there
5794799 the transmutation into a luminous light body is a purification or distillation process in which we rid ourselves of darkness on a psychological level our emotions such as anger lust jealousy ignorance and pride are transmuted through meditation and through working on ourselves the work begins on the inner levels the whole change of the world has to start with you so if you want a world of beauty and connectivity you have to start with yourself
5794800 when we show our body without prudence without modesty we are prostituting ourselves
5794801 it gives rapists permission to say well she had on a miniskirt
5794802 what the church says has credibility thats why this type of statement is so dangerous
5794803 so i have a job to do a job to complete in that sense yes i would like to run
5794804 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing on its own and living off its own means
5794805 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5794806 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country
5794807 does not have a properly functional government yet it must get that
5794808 the reason we are still around is because of the immense resilience of the afghan people and their goodheartedness toward the presence of the international community
5794809 other than that activities like breaking into homes would have gotten us into serious trouble a long time back
5794810 we also want the weaponry in this war to be targeted at the terrorists properly to be aimed at the right place
5794811 i dont want afghan casualties the is not in afghan villages period it is in the sanctuaries of terrorists at the of terrorists at the financial resources of terrorists
5794812 it is virtually impossible to mitigate against loss of civilian lives when insurgents mix in with the local population
5794813 i dont for a second believe that afghanistan has a problem of terrorism
5794814 afghanistan has only suffered at the hands of terrorism or the consequences of it
5794815 what is troubling is the deteriorating set of conditions across the border in pakistan military sanctuaries expanding in areas in the tribal area and the freedom of movement across the border to afghanistan
5794816 with regard to corruption its a deeper problem its an afghan problem
5794817 its the problem of an inefficient government machinery its a problem of economy procedures its a problem of so much money coming into afghanistan its a problem of the international presence
5794818 mr dmitry kovalyov you could have made a movie that was critical of any group or race you are allowed to critisize and malign anyone christians catholics mormans white russians eskimos anyone but instead you made a dvd critical of jews this is not allowed it is against the law
5794819 pay attention mr dmitry kovalyov anti semetism is to be taken serious in this country you should have used your talents at criticizing the russian orthodox church if you made a movie that was titled
5794820 after rave reviews and a 7 week run in new york his film constantines sword is playing to sell out audiences in boston and other cities around the country
5794821 you can see it in his eyes the sadness in his expression anquish dismayed colorless in the background stands a christian church a symbol of so much hatred of religiously inspired violence and war anti semetism mr carroll cant bear to look at it he turns away ashamed
5794822 the film brings the history of this religious intolerance to life tracing it as a source of the fanaticism that threatens the world today
5794823 i can think of no better way of marking his historic success than by naming scotlands only
5794824 with luck he will continue his sporting domination before a home crowd in 2014 with his name on the walls of the velodrome
5794825 my doctor has advised me not to travel in the short term and so regretfully i am unable to attend what will surely be an historic convention in denver

5794829 the wonderful thing about having it close by is that it means there are more opportunities for all of the cultural community in philadelphia to connect and work with tyler
5794830 they had this romantic notion they wanted tyler to remain in the spot where they had gone to school
5794831 if they hadnt been back in 20 years they werent seeing how it was today
5794832 tyler is about creativity and pushing contemporary boundaries and to have anything other than a contemporary building is odd
5794833 i wish i was the law medical or business school dean
5794834 it was idyllic there were beautiful plantings it was one of those little gems that you have when youre growing up that you dont appreciate
5794835 it smelled of linseed oil which is from the oil paint its a smell that you never forget
5794836 the technology has changed the scale in which people do art now has changed and it really needs the kind of space that theyre going to have
5794837 but when they hang their bfa and mfa exhibitions nobody but us sees it
5794838 but its nice because you can really focus in your studio and be really intense
5794839 theres a certain nostalgia about the community here were very small very tight knit
5794840 maybe moving from this nice quaint little location wont be so bad
5794841 you could restrict it down at least so you could drive after 12 midnight
5794842 if you want to walk to your friends house and the police come through they stop you and take you down to the station and call your parents
5794843 i think the curfew is overrated even if youre out with your older sister whos like 17 youll still get caught thats ridiculous
5794844 i cant even check my mailbox at night ive made up my mind im leaving pulaski aint got nothing for kids like us to do
5794845 pulaski aint got nothing for kids like us to do
5794846 kids like me like to stay out late we like staying out having fun man
5794847 there is very little kids can do late at night that serves a useful purpose
5794848 the ones that dont micromanage their kids lives are the ones that dont know what their kids are doing
5794849 they dont have public transportation for people like it is
5794850 you dont have to worry about gangs you wont find that in pulaski
5794851 if theyre committing a crime then punish them for the crime
5794852 if youth think theyre being treated as a problem and not people theyre not going to forget it when theyre 18
5794853 its always tough to demonstrate what doesnt happen but you know kids can get out here and get in groups and what turns into a game turns into something serious
5794854 talk to you and ask you questions about what youre up to

5794858 chinas constant talk of a peaceful rise and of peaceful development is an attempt to create an image of a young and dynamic new economy the astonishing growth of the countrys economy in recent years can make it appear like a strong economic youngster growing into powerful and confident world of developed countries yet real chinese society is gray both in age and numbers according to the world health organization an aging society is either one in which 10 of the population is over 60 years old or in another measure 7 of the population is over 65 nationwide by the end of 2005 china had almost 144 million people over the age of 60 accounting for 11 of the entire population the number of elderly people is rising fast at 3 a year overall with the number of those over 80 rising by 5 a year by 2010 other estimates say china will have 174 million people over 60 more than 20 million of whom will be over 80 by 2025 there will be 280 million people in china over the age of 60 by 2045 that number will have risen to 400 million the average age in china which was around 30 in 2000 will rise to 39 by 2025 by 2040 the average age will be 44 meaning the country will age faster in a generation than europe has in a century to put it another way by 2050 average age will be three years higher than average lifespan was in 1950
5794859 chinas dilemma is that it will grow old before it grows rich as the number of elderly continues to rise and chinas use of the one child policy prevents an increase in younger people to support them the situation will get exponentially worse by 2050 by some estimates the average lifespan will be an incredible 85 years old this means many one of the one child workers of the future will have to devote even more resources to supporting two retired parents and four retired grandparents about 65 of the elderly population in rural areas receive no benefits from chinas social welfare system by 2040 when chinas aged population will be at its peak the countrys social security budget will have a shortfall of us 128 billion annually chinas government has plenty of bland pronouncements to make about its attitude towards the elderly the state values and cherishes senior citizens for their knowledge experience and skills and respects them for their good ethical values it thus makes vigorous efforts to create good conditions for senior citizens to bring into full play their expertise and capability and gives them encouragement and support to integrate into society and continue to make contributions to the social development of china said a recent white paper on the elderly from the information office of chinas state council but apart from mentioning current facts and figures such as that the nation had only 20 000 professional nurses for the aged by the end of 2005 the 7 500 word document released at the end of 2006 had almost nothing concrete to say about what needs to be done in the future

5794892 the christian god is a being of terrific character cruel vindictive capricious and unjust
5794893 we play with just one putter and a whole variety of minigolf balls you dont change the putter but youre allowed to change the ball on each hole
5794894 different balls will play and behave differently according to the properties of the material they are made from
5794895 on an 18 hole round you will probably use 18 different balls you need really fantastic hand eye coordination to get it right
5794896 i decided to use a deutschmann 085 it is a fast ball i then warmed it up so it becomes faster fast enough for the rebound shot straight into the hole rather than the alternative safety shot
5794897 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
5794898 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
5794899 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
5794900 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
5794901 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
5794902 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
5794903 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law
5794904 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5794905 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5794906 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to thinkthat the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5794907 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5794908 if he picks ridge the convention blows up you will have a base completely demoralized
5794909 and it will be viewed that he is ceding the future of the gop to a liberal republican it would be a disaster
5794910 oh great these guys game thread aug 19 braves at mets
5794911 i think young people are going to make the biggest difference in this election
5794912 weve become much more aware of how important politics are in our daily lives
5794913 urbanist somebody who embraces the pulse of the city and contributes to the beat
5794914 my doctor has advised me not to travel in the short term and so regretfully i am unable to attend what will surely be an historic convention in denver
5794915 i was very much looking forward to chairing the california delegation and i offer my best wishes to californias delegates in this vital nomination process
5794916 we are not going to be ready for today because we need to meet those conditions thursday is what we are shooting for
5794917 but we would probably be going through the trash cans for art supplies
5794918 some kids dont have money to go to dance schools to get better at it
5794919 in gate she became more outgoing and excited about what they get to do
5794920 under the current law if the u s congress provides a specific funding then govguam must condemn private property even without the involvement of the people of guam
5794921 the current law gives the governor the right to condemn private property without any consultation with the legislature or the people of guam
5794922 we continue to find that the gpss employees and staff and superintendent are working very hard to solve these problems
5794923 we give them high marks for cooperation and effort but we continue to be concerned about the continuity of that effort
5794924 i think the mindset of the current and existing board is that theyre the boss they are in charge of the superintendent and they will hire and fire as they see fit
5794925 its a style of management that maybe is particular to this chairman its management by threat and it does not sit well with u s doe
5794926 as long as i am signing her time sheet and her leave and everything i expect to see that documentation
5794927 the question remains for the legislature perhaps who sets policy who do you want to run the school system elected individuals who are suppose to represent a cross section of the community or professionals
5794928 now if the superintendent was appointed by the governor that would be unstable why its termination at will
5794929 the superintendent currently we have to justify thorough cause to terminate the superintendent and at this point there is no cause
5794930 i know the governor is mad mad because we are in charge
5794931 i do believe the guam education policy board is in charge and doing its role
5794932 they have not solved all the problems they were the first ones to admit they havent solved all the problems
5794933 and we didnt expect all the problems to be solved what we want to see is continued progress
5794934 thats a concern for us because a large percentage of the money that flows to us from federal programs goes through a procurement process of some kind
5794935 so if thats broken thats where money could leak so we want to make sure that gets solved
5794936 please know that the people of guam share your grief and mourn with you and we will forever be grateful for the sacrifice that tony has made
5794937 we will remember tony for his devotion to our nation and his valiant efforts to defend our freedom
5794938 it would have been my privilege to have served with petty officer carbullido
5794939 im here today because my boy inspires me to reach out to other people in their hardest of times and to support families like i was supported in my time
5794940 we have to engage them so that they think of college as their next step in life we must erase this aspirational deficit of our young people
5794941 we will engage them through active recruitment internet conversations and connections and visits lots of them they must aspire to college and we will then tell them about the university of guam
5794942 in order to be the natural choice we must ensure academic quality and tell our story of excellence in service teaching and research
5794943 we must provide our programs in new formats that reflect the latest in instructional technology and techniques both on line and in class when they think of us as their natural choice we will become the natural choice for everyone else

5795139 each year research on the health effects of soy and soybean components seems to increase exponentially furthermore research is not just expanding in the primary areas under investigation such as cancer heart disease and osteoporosis new findings suggest that soy has potential benefits that may be more extensive than previously thought
5795140 just imagine you could grow the perfect food this food not only would provide affordable nutrition but also would be delicious and easy to prepare in a variety of ways it would be a healthful food with no saturated fat in fact you would be growing a virtual fountain of youth on your back forty
5795141 this ideal food would help prevent and perhaps reverse some of the worlds most dreaded diseases you could grow this miracle crop in a variety of soils and climates its cultivation would build up not deplete the land this miracle food already exists its called soy
5795142 the quickest way to gain product acceptability in the less affluent society
5795143 is to have the product consumed on its own merit in a more affluent society
5795144 strengthen the position of soybeans in the market place and maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets for uses for soybeans and soybean products
5795145 the humble tortilla mexicos corn based staple food into a protein fortified super tortilla that would give a nutritional boost to the nearly 20 million mexicans who live in extreme poverty

5795147 you dont have to twist the arm of a 55 to 60 year old guy to get him to try soy milk
5795148 nutritional quality of soy bean protein isolates studies in children of preschool age
5795149 consisting of a detailed review of human clinical data collected from more than 40 scientific studies conducted over the last 20 years soy protein was found to be one of the rare foods that had sufficient scientific evidence not only to qualify for an fda health claim proposal but to ultimately pass the rigorous approval process
5795150 only soy protein that has been processed in a manner in which isoflavones are retained will result in cholesterol lowering
5795151 researchers substituting meta analysis for more rigorous trials risk are making faulty assumptions and indulging in creative accounting

5795153 soy has demonstrated powerful anticancer benefits the japanese who eat 30 times as much soy as north americans have a lower incidence of cancers of the breast uterus and prostate
5795154 the data in this review cannot be used as a basis for claiming that soy intake decreases cancer risk
5795155 those who ate a lot of tofu by the time they were 75 or 80 looked five years older
5795156 the association between soybean consumption and goiter in animals and humans has a long history
5795157 current evidence for the beneficial effects of soy requires a full understanding of potential adverse effects as well
5795158 will be at least somewhat predictive of what occurs in humans there is no reason to assume that there will be gross malformations of fetuses but there may be subtle changes such as neurobehavioral attributes immune function and sex hormone levels
5795159 could be nothing or could be something of great concern if mom is eating something that can act like sex hormones it is logical to wonder if that could change the babys development
5795160 against the backdrop of widespread praise there is growing suspicion that soy despite its undisputed benefits may pose some health hazards
5795161 not one of the 18 scientists interviewed for this column was willing to say that taking isoflavones was risk free
5795162 the industry has known for years that soy contains many toxins at first they told the public that the toxins were removed by processing when it became apparent that processing could not get rid of them they claimed that these substances were beneficial your government granted a health claim to a substance that is poisonous and the industry lied to the public to sell more soy

5795165 we have a moral obligation to the jewish people to honor the commitment that has been made through decades and decades of understanding that there is going to be a homeland for the jewish people
5795166 the question shouldnt be do arabs have a right to live in jewish territory
5795167 but do jews have a right to live in jewish territory
5795168 to say that jews cant live in jerusalem is the equivalent of telling the boston red sox they cant play in fenway park obviously that would never go over very well on beacon hill
5795169 in terms of the deepest roots and attachment to the land of israel mike huckabee really wins out
5795170 he is more than happy to learn firsthand what actually is going on which is all i ask any political figure to do in america
5795171 i wish that jewish leaders would speak so clearly so unequivocally
5795172 heres a guy who says yes im for a palestinian state and then says but in saudi arabia
5795173 thus saith the lord yet again there shall be heard in this place whereof ye say it is detroyed without man and without beast in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are destroyed without man and without inhabitant and without beast the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that say give thanks to the lord of hosts for the lord is good for his mercy endureth for ever even of them that bring offerings of thanksgiving into the house of the lord for i will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first saith the lord
5795174 they would like to deter israel showing off and telling israel and the americans beware of us the only thing one can do is to explain the situation and the real facts and not lose focus on the real threat and that is the nuclearization of iran
5795175 the argument that the release of palestinian prisoners from israeli jails strengthens the moderates has never proven to be correct
5795176 ironically in some cases the released prisoners turned out to be a big headache for the moderate palestinian leadership many of them soon became involved in various criminal activities ranging from armed robberies extortion theft and arms trafficking others later joined hamas and other radical groups and became actively involved in armed attacks on israel during the second intifada
5795177 put the local heroes on its payroll and pay them salaries although many of them were not doing any work
5795178 highly unlikely that abbas would benefit from the release of the prisoners because many palestinians dont give him credit for the move rather these palestinians see the decision as an attempt on the part of israel to improve its image on the international arena and extract political concessions from abbas and his colleagues in ramallah
5795179 the decision is seen by hamas and its supporters as an israeli attempt to drive a wedge between fatah and hamas and deepen divisions among the palestinians
5795180 were quick to emphasize that it was insufficient and that israel must now free all the security prisoners
5795181 we should have had this memorial in front of all the athletes sponsored by the ioc
5795182 this is not an israeli issue this concerns the whole olympic family
5795183 nations that are not willing to condemn terrorism openly or refuse to compete against other nations because of their nationality or race or religion they should not be part of the olympics its contrary to the olympic ideal
5795184 the blackest event in the long history of the olympic games
5795185 athletes coaches and judges of your country who came to the olympic games to compete in peace and harmony
5795186 an event that the world and the olympic movement will never forget
5795187 in accordance with the criteria set by previous government decisions namely no release of those prisoners with blood on their hands belonging to hamas or palestinian jihad
5795188 exception to the criterion of no blood on their hands as a gesture to palestinian authority chief mahmoud abbas in consideration of the long sentence they have served and the opinion of the security forces that the risk resulting from their release is low
5795189 those who elected such a government shouldnt be surprised that terrorists are being freed
5795190 first of all we plan to file a suit with the supreme court against this scandalous decision we do not expect to win but we have been told by people high up in the system that if it were not for our protests and petitions to the supreme court many more terrorists guilty of very serious crimes would have been freed
5795191 we plan to take the law into our hands in the positive sense of the phrase
5795192 we have had bitter experience with the 180 victims of terrorism who have been killed by terrorists freed in one exchange or another we will gather information on every single convicted terrorist find out which jail they are in and which luxuries they receive in prison and we will be in contact with the families of those they have murdered and we will thus keep this matter in the public awareness the prison service people and those in the general security service support us because they are sick and tired of these releases the gss works hard to arrest them and then they are freed just like that
5795193 to accomplish this by the way we need volunteers who will be willing to go to the justice ministry and ferret out the information with our guidance those interested should call 02 538 8999
5795194 especially shas they make all sorts of protests and vote against but they remain in the government and refuse to bring it down because they think that getting money for their torah schools justifies all i debated a shas official on the radio i told him that i had always learned that when it comes to pikuach nefesh life threatening situations one must close his talmud and take action
5795195 because it sees the fatah prisoners going free while its members are still in prison this will encourage them to come to a deal with us for shalit
5795196 the name of the game is prestige when hamas sees 200 fatah prisoners being let out for free it will make sure to get many more of its own prisoners so that its people will see that it can do better than fatah and prime minister olmert this is all a lowdown tactic of his so that later when he releases more murderers for shalit hell be able to say we have already released two murderers for free or for dead bodies eldad regev and ehud goldwasser but now were releasing murderers and receiving a live soldier in exchange it is a disgusting trick and places every israeli citizen in danger
5795197 secret non belligerence pact between the italian state and palestinian resistance organizations including terrorist groups
5795198 the terms of the agreement were that the palestinian organizations could even maintain armed bases of operation in the country and they had freedom of entry and exit without being subject to normal police controls because they were handled by the secret services
5795199 driven on the streets by a well known ideologue of the extra parliamentary left
5795200 barak objects to the budget for political reasons and if the prime minister has no choice he will consider firing him
5795201 we are the first group all over the world that fought for the jewish people are the jewish people happy to see what israel has done with her allies
5795202 how can he protect the people of israel when he cant even protect people who served with him
5795203 as far as i am concerned ehud barak is a traitor because when he withdrew the idf from lebanon he said that the children of the sla members are children of the state of israel and today those children dont even have a house
5795204 until every family will get a house like he gave hizbullah for free
5795205 let the arrests be an example to those who sell their homeland and their people
5795206 the palestinian authority pa has made formal assurances that it will not carry out a planned execution of a suspected israeli agent handed down by a military tribunal
5795207 we have a much broader palette because it takes place at the smithsonian so theres a bunch of different museums we get in and out of like the air and space museum and the art galleries we go into paintings and stuff
5795208 fair thee be dealt thy hand that hath bestowed this name upon thy love your heart may not hold hands with love nor chaos nor snow nor fire no light no darkness and to kiss your lips will sear the stars you once believe in i am no thief but i am no giver and there is no sin for the pain i deliver i can not help you i will not save you there are no shortcuts so time will not take you this is no game but can be seen as a test and if you survive you may have your one wish

5795210 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
5795211 i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
5795212 im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either
5795213 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
5795214 once we were working it felt like a good fit
5795215 by realistically assessing american military capabilities at a time when it is fighting two difficult counter insurgencies in nations under occupation and by determining that western europe is too economically dependent on russian energy exports for the nato alliance to offer substantive opposition to russian policies in central asia russia calls into question the entire basis of its post cold war relationship with the west
5795216 rates of infection among african americans and also among hispanics are much higher than among white women sixty four percent of women with hiv are black even though blacks only make up about 13 percent of the u s population
5795217 my doctor has advised me not to travel in the short term and so regretfully i am unable to attend what will surely be an historic convention in denver
5795218 i was very much looking forward to chairing the california delegation and i offer my best wishes to californias delegates in this vital nomination process
5795219 we are sorry to see greg burris leave but it is a terrific opportunity for him and the city is lucky to have someone of his caliber
5795220 with ken mcclure ready to assume these duties in the interim however we will have a very smooth transition to the new vice president
5795221 these are busy and exciting times at missouri state university and i am honored to serve in this interim capacity
5795222 despite some headlight and grille changes for 2006 the overall appearance is practically the same as when the model made its debut
5795223 hood slopes down to a wide grille flanked by wraparound headlights
5795224 now have body colored bumpers bodyside moldings door handles and side mirrors
5795225 its appearance styling would be too strong a word lacks character
5795226 while there are no sharp boxy edges its not all soft and curvy either it looks competent and useful which is how a car should be
5795227 the design is getting long in the tooth and looks dated compared to newer crossovers
5795228 the pilots need of updating is evident in its interior though respectable the materials arent as rich as those of some fresher competitors
5795229 performance is strong and confident if not exactly blistering response is quick easy and seamless from the engine and automatic transmission
5795230 about 1 000 pounds greater than many crossover rivals but well below the ratings for traditional truck based dodge durango
5795231 smooth and comfortable and the handling gives a feeling of security
5795232 interior may make you feel youre in an 2008 honda pilot set the standards in 2003 for the crossover class in terms of comfort ergonomics and fit and finish and still holds up well five years later
5795233 t heater seating provides a better view for rear passengers
5795234 is best left to small kids as legroom is tight
5795235 is it big enough can you fit a grown up in it is it easy to fold in a word yes you can count on it
5795236 a 4 foot wide sheet of plywood will fit flat on the floor
5795237 with all seats occupied theres still enough room for grocery bags baby equipment or a set of golf clubs
5795238 tons of bins and pockets for containing and hiding all our stuff
5795239 the cabin features good ergonomics straightforward controls and high quality materials
5795240 the optional perforated leather seats are all wrapped in quality materials
5795241 its imprecise action means it often overshoots the drive position
5795242 though respectable the interior materials arent as rich as those of some fresher competitors
5795243 you cant order a pilot with navigation and the rear seat dvd
5795244 is easier to learn and use than most but its screen is small and the driver must stretch to reach the main toggle control
5795245 the big rig look is a long time ram styling cue
5795246 the dodge rams aggressive styling has stood out since 1994
5795247 the mega cabs scale also requires mega sized garages or parking spots
5795248 pretty bare bones offering little more than 17 inch wheels while the slt adds alloy wheels
5795249 a prominent gunsight crossbar grille surrounded by bold brightwork dark grey on the base st with squared off fenders and wraparound headlamps
5795250 additional shiny bits and chrome wheels are part of higher trim levels
5795251 all ram 2500 and short box quad cab ram 3500 models come with standard rear wheels while all other ram 3500s have duallie rear wheels
5795252 an interior redesign a few years ago maintained the trucks freshness
5795253 a slab of glossy hopelessly fake wood placed front and center is the primary concession to cheesiness
5795254 those who place a high importance on interior design and features may find more to admire in the rams heavy duty competitors from 2008 dodge ram hd maintains its signature style though its more dated than its contemporaries a redesign in 09 promises an evolution of the big rig aesthetic
5795255 with the diesel engine the ram meets 2010 truck emissions standards in all 50 states
5795256 for those seeking up to 16 500 lb of towing capacity theres the 6 7 liter cummins turbo diesel
5795257 a new six speed automatic transmission is smart enough to know how to adjust to empty versus loaded torque loads
5795258 a competent all around engine but for serious towing and hauling plus decent fuel economy the 6 7 liter cummins turbodiesel is essential
5795259 packing 350 horsepower and 650 pound feet of torque the big six cylinder diesel helps this ram tow up to 13 350 pounds
5795260 diesel engine also features a life to major overhaul interval of 350 000 miles and standard duty oil change intervals of 7500 miles
5795261 the cummins cant quite match the hemis off the line snap
5795262 these are work trucks so unless you plan major towing go with something more amenable
5795263 for the v8 a six speed manual is standard and a five speed automatic is optional
5795264 mighty diesel engine can be paired to a six speed manual or automatic transmission
5795265 the six speed automatic transmission is an equally laudable and smooth operator like the five speed automatic that backs the hemi engine it offers a convenient tow haul mode switch on the shift lever
5795266 is smart enough to know how to adjust to empty versus loaded torque loads and it also has a thumb controller switch that allows the driver to select or lock out specific gears without the shifters need to be in manual mode
5795267 the transition from high to low range on 4x4 slt and laramie models is now done electrically rather than via a manual lever as it is on sl and sxt models
5795268 the four wheel drive 2500 has a solid front axle and recirculating ball steering setup while the two wheel drive model gets an independent front suspension and rack and pinion steering
5795269 although its built to take on the most demanding tasks the 2008 dodge ram hd is still a surprisingly comfortable truck for daily use
5795270 while the ride on certain road surfaces can get slightly choppy particularly in an unladen 4x4 model adding passengers or payload settles things down nicely
5795271 uneventful if not effortless braking from 60 mph to zero consumes a fairly long 166 feet some 17 feet longer than the last heavy duty ram we tested
5795272 a ram 2500 can tote up to 3230 pounds of payload and tow up to 13 700 pounds while a ram 3500 can haul up to 5110 pounds of payload and tow up to 16 850 pounds
5795273 the rear doors on quad and mega cab models swing open nearly 90 degrees to facilitate loading and unloading
5795274 the mega cab features rear seats that can recline up to 37 degrees
5795275 rear seating in quad cabs is noticeably more cramped than in competitors crew cab trucks the mega cab more than compensates by expanding legroom by nearly a foot and offering a comfy reclining backseat
5795276 the mega cab which was introduced in 2006 adds 22 inches of cabin length and features rear seats that can recline up to 37 degrees
5795277 the mega cabs additional 20 inches of length yields outstanding accommodations for front seat and particularly rear seat passengers
5795278 from decently civil in a vinyl clad st level regular cab ram 2500 with its 40 20 40 split bench seat to quite nice in a cloth covered six passenger sxt or slt quad cab and to demonstrably upscale in a leather swathed and ultra spacious laramie spec mega cab
5795279 the mega cabs gigantic rear seat makes the presidential accommodations on air force one seem snug and the seats themselves also fold away with ease
5795280 the standard bed is shorter than expected while the mega cabs truncated bed could potentially limit fifth wheel trailering applications
5795281 the rear doors on quad and mega cab models swing open nearly 90 degrees to facilitate loading and unloading
5795282 could be a bit better although it is a straightforward user friendly
5795283 the dashboards simple layout makes for easy use and appears to be constructed to a high standard
5795284 the instruments are legible and most switches and controls well positioned although the audio system selector buttons and the undersized display for the optional navigation system could use a rethink
5795285 the cabin is never filled with any objectionable noise even at full throttle and there is scarcely a trace of diesel clatter evident provided you dont open the door when the engine is idling
5795286 four wheel antilock disc brakes are standard on the heavy duty ram 2500
5795287 the cab sits high off the ground offering excellent sightlines
5795288 five out of five stars for its protection of front occupants in head on collisions
5795289 optional on the slt and standard on the laramie are power adjustable pedals
5795290 the cab sits high off the ground offering excellent sightlines
5795291 slt models get sirius satellite radio with one year subscription
5795292 the regular cab comes in st or slt trims the quad cab in st slt or laramie trims and the mega cab in sxt or laramie only
5795293 the ram st is pretty bare bones offering little more than 17 inch wheels vinyl upholstery 40 20 40 front bench seat air conditioning and a cd player
5795294 adds chrome bumpers cloth upholstery power windows locks and mirrors keyless remote and cruise control
5795295 yes essentials cloth upholstery that 2008 dodge ram hd slt models they continue
5795296 leather and faux wood in mega cabs as well as a power drivers seat dual zone climate control steering wheel cruise control buttons security alarm and more brightwork in quad cabs
5795297 6 way power adjustable front seats front center seat cushion storage power adjustable pedals auto dimming rearview mirror chromed aluminum wheels infinity 7 speaker sound system leather wrapped steering wheel with audio controls dodges uconnect hands free cell phone link power sliding rear window and fog lights
5795298 the descriptively named popular equipment group st slt navigation convenience group slt power wagon laramie light group sxt slt and sport appearance group slt
5795299 for 4x4 regular cabs and quad cabs dodge also offers the power wagon trim this ram is highly specialized for off road duty with its raised suspension front and rear differential locks electronically disengaging front stabilizer bar 33 inch tires 12 000 pound winch and full skid plates
5795300 any sxt model can be equipped with the comprehensive trx4 off road package that includes skid plates limited slip differential on and off road tires tow hooks and fog lamps
5795301 chrome tipped dual exhausts are installed with the v 6 engine
5795302 the horizontal taillights look a lot like those on the previous generation honda accord
5795303 some might argue the hyundai sonata 2008 design is also somewhat generic
5795304 the sonatas new styling even if its squarely on the conservative side
5795305 dont see any single design feature likely to turn anybody away from the car
5795306 the overall look is clearly competitive with most in the class and better than some
5795307 the cabins are highlighted by soft padded surfaces even storage bins are lined overall the interior is nicely done
5795308 simple white on black gauges are easy to read in any lighting condition but the high set audio deck places some functions just out of easy reach
5795309 a 162 horsepower four cylinder engine comes standard a 234 hp v6 is optional acceleration is brisk with the four cylinder and brings a grin to the face with the v6 hyundai officials say the v6 can accelerate from 0 60 miles per hour in about 7 5 seconds with a top speed of 130 mph
5795310 four cylinder sonatas have adequate pep around town and their passing reserves are comparable to rival midsize sedans
5795311 a five speed manual gearbox is standard in hyundai 2008 gls and se models and a four speed shiftronic automatic with a manual shift provision is optional
5795312 a new five speed shiftronic automatic couples with v 6 engines
5795313 the shiftronic automatic transmission moves between gears smoothly kicking down for passing with minimal hesitation the automatic offered responsive performance while tackling the hills of san francisco
5795314 in manual mode the shiftronic will upshift automatically when the engine bumps up against redline it declines to downshift at all leaving that to the drivers preferences
5795315 4 speed automatic is prompt to downshift for more power but the 5 speed unit used on the v6 hesitates briefly before downshifting and tends to hunt between gears on hilly terrain
5795316 4 cylinder sonatas with the automatic transmission averaged 25 9 26 4 mpg in mostly highway driving
5795317 averaged 18 8 mpg in city highway driving and 15 6 including gas eating performance runs
5795318 steering is light and direct with good on center feel and directional stability
5795319 brakes are mostly linear and equipped with electronic brake force distribution which improves stability and reduces stopping distances by balancing brake force on the fly between the front and rear tires
5795320 is compliant over small surface imperfections but it reacts harshly to sharp bumps and ridges
5795321 the suspension is still on the soft side and the steering remains a bit vague the 2008 hyundai sonata smothers bumps well while handling precisely and keeping its composure in turns
5795322 on the plus side means more nimble and confident handling
5795323 on the flip side means a ride less insulated from rough roads
5795324 enough interior room to meet the epas definition of a large car
5795325 enough interior room to meet the epas definition of a large car roomier in almost every dimension than most of its mid size competitors with a full size edge in creature comfort
5795326 has recessed rear head restraints and can seat up to five occupants
5795327 greater distance between the driver and windshield pillar that enhances the sensation of roominess
5795328 have difficulty finding a comfortable driving position taller adults in particular may feel that they sit too close to the steering wheel even with the telescopic steering column set to its furthest forward position
5795329 the rear seatback is split 60 40 and folds to allow the transport of long objects such as skis and snowboards or gardening tool but storage bins and cubbies are about average for the class
5795330 abundant interior storage is highlighted by a generous glovebox two tier center armrest console and large door map pockets
5795331 cargo volume totals 16 3 cubic feet maximized thanks to strut assists that open the trunk from the sides as opposed to the arm style hinges many competitors use which encroach on luggage space when shut
5795332 some newer rivals meet and exceed sonata for overall build quality
5795333 some rough edges on a few plastic molds and a less than lustrous finish on some dash panels
5795334 the attractive environment also features nicer materials and cleaner designs than many might expect with the possible exception of the center of the instrument panel and the 2008 hyundai sonatas designers have done a fine job in minimizing the effects of inexpensive plastic
5795335 the hyundai 2008 sonatas cabin exudes a fair amount of quality via the precise feel of most controls and an abundance of soft touch surfaces
5795336 exceptionally well equipped in terms of standard passive safety features
5795337 safety features on all sonatas include the mandatory dual stage front seat airbags front seat side impact airbags for torso protection and full coverage side curtain airbags designed to provide head protection
5795338 visibility is great courtesy of big mirrors and abundant glass
5795339 outward visibility is good although the wide c pillars constrict quick over the shoulder traffic checks for lane changing
5795340 all trims get a cd mp3 audio system with xm satellite radio
5795341 since the sonata is already fairly well equipped options are few
5795342 one of the sonatas key selling points the base sonata features a sophisticated 2 4 liter four cylinder engine mated to a five speed manual transmission air conditioning am fm cd mp3 sound system cruise control keyless entry power windows and door locks heated power side mirrors and leather wrapped tilt steering wheel
5795343 the popular equipment package adds automatic headlights chrome window belt moldings upgraded interior accents power driver seat with adjustable lumbar support steering wheel audio controls and a trip computer the premium package for either hyundai 2008 se adds an infinity am fm xm 6cd mp3 audio system with six speakers subwoofer and component amplifier power tilt and slide sunroof and an electrochromic auto dimming rear view mirror with homelink and a compass the hyundai 2008 limited features leather seating surfaces eight way power drivers seat heated front seats automatic climate control with filtration electrochromic auto dimming rear view mirror with homelink and compass telescoping steering wheel and a sliding center armrest
5795344 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5795345 allora perch lho fatto potrei dare un milione di risposte tutte false la verit che sono cattivo ma questo cambier io cambier lultima volta che faccio cose come questa metto la testa apposto vado avanti rigo dritto
5795346 touch me im going to scream pt 2 has a great video the song itself is a bit of a departure for the band incorporating a bit of a disco beat and an omnichord but its still very much a mmj tune because of frontman
5795347 i want you to listen very carefully and i want you to listen carefully since i would be asking a lot of questions after i am done with the story
5795348 i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5795349 now the drive bys when it comes to sen john mccain are all excited that he might choose a pro choice and or liberal pro choice running mate
5795350 what is this about picking a liberal democrat or a liberal republican mccain has already seen to it that he can walk across the aisle that hes the top of the ticket if anybody is going to attract moderates its going to be the top of the ticket guy hes not going to help himself any additional way hes going to hurt himself by putting a liberal or a liberal republican on this ticket particularly pro choice if they do that if the mccain camp does that they will have effectively destroyed the republican party and pushed the conservative movement into the bleachers
5795351 see the drive bys are just hoping for this they are just hoping for it because they know its not just a few loudmouths in the base they know the base will totally turn on mccain if this is the case its not that they want someone whos pro choice on mccains ticket its not about them being true to believe its about finding a way to persuade mccain to make a decision that will guarantee his defeat
5795352 mccain if he does this to please the drive bys or for whatever advice i cant imagine the people around mccain are this dumb but they might be a bunch of yes men
5795353 if he picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty and the drive bys know it and theyre trying to encourage him to do so its amazing all of these drive byers who by the way folks know nothing about us they dont know what makes us tick were aliens to them and they think that were gonna at the end of the day sit around and vote for mccain regardless and this is where the miscalculation is huge
5795354 someone like rick santorum other than tom ridge how about some discussion from the mccain campaign about a conservative who can be counted on across the board who can help lead the country in the right direction who can help rebuild the republican party lieberman cant do that and rebuild the conservative movement neither mccain nor lieberman nor ridge can do that
5795355 the responding officer was able to get significant information about the incident
5795356 sex assaults occur every day in our community but some cases are high profile
5795357 a great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within
5795358 there are a number of ifs in order for the as to stick around because theyve already made that deal down in fremont
5795359 the question is whether that deal will stick or not and ive said to wolff if theres anything we can do thats within reason were prepared to do it
5795360 with a deal that is as big as the deal is in fremont anything could go wrong
5795361 i want to continue to keep the door open so that we can keep the as the best case scenario would be that they stay in oakland i would like to try to help them stay in oakland
5795362 oh that i had wings like a dove for then would i fly away and be at rest lo then would i wander far off and remain in the wilderness selah i would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest
5795363 these creatures have an intelligent designer this is obvious it also is not surprising that there are those who do not give god credit for anything sad for them
5795364 i personally feel very sorry for those who think there is no god in perspective this may be what wrong with our world today no belief in anything leaves the soul empty i will pray for you
5795365 all ideas concerning the very early universe cosmogony are necessarily speculative as of today no accelerator experiments probe energies of sufficient magnitude to provide any insight into the period all proposed scenarios differ radically some examples being the hartle hawking initial state string landscape brane inflation string gas cosmology and the ekpyrotic universe some of these are mutually compatible while others are not
5795366 but i cant resist asking if you dont agree that all ideas concerning god are necessarily speculative as well
5795367 many believe thats why mlk was assassinated cuz he was aiming to mobilize the working class
5795368 black people hair doesnt look like european hair when permed
5795369 you know to make it shiny and wavy am i too in self denial
5795370 only black people have to justify the ish they do to themselves beauty wise
5795371 im black and proud to be black and i think the more folks try and gauge someone elses blackness
5795372 it is not so much if you do it it is the
5795373 r kelly i thought should have helped her out post bond he didnt have to but she was up there to see him shes a fan of his she said free r kelly hes got the money pay the 5 000
5795374 yeah if he didnt bail me out send me a message or something thank you goodbye something let me know hes there for me like i was for him
5795375 this is the worlds worstest worstest worstest reason to go to jail for sure but im still going to be an r kelly fan im not gonna say i love him i dont love him but im still a fan
5795376 kellys attorney says the singer asked about helping triplett after watching the judge order her to jail but lawyers advised him it wouldnt look right
5795377 jesses mad at barack for telling absentee fathers like himself to take care of their kids

5795380 behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride fulness of bread and careless ease was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy
5795381 now this was the sin of your sister sodom she and her daughters were arrogant overfed and unconcerned they did not help the poor and needy
5795382 behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy

5795385 when ive taken some black folks to task for their obama hate i get labeled as a cult follower or im accused of choosing style over substance as if hillary was anything substantiative
5795386 wow maybe some people dont like him as a politician
5795387 i realized that we thought we loved our sisters but that we actually hated them we hated them because they were black and we were black and on some level much deeper than we realized we hated the hell out of ourselves
5795388 its not enough that rape shouldnt exist it never should have come up in the first place it never ever should have entered the mind of a man
5795389 if you want to vilify black women maybe you should look at why you feel a need to blame the victims of patriarchy and misogyny
5795390 and while were at it you might want to review your misunderstanding of schizophrenia not only is the usage of the term in that context nonsensical in regard to the point youre trying to make but its offensive too
5795391 and on some level much deeper than we realized we hated the hell out of ourselves
5795392 the garden variety sociopath or psychopath who is the ring leader wouldnt get far in these types of situations if someone the average guy that is present had the moral center and basis to know that women and girls are person deserving of respect and dignity
5795393 youre right theyre not but when the statistics are 1 woman in 4 is raped youre inevitably going to have rape victims among the mothers youre talking about
5795394 hey some of the women who enable this behavior were or are perhaps victims themselves
5795395 so these women who are rape survivors not all of them but statistically there has to be a sizable portion of them
5795396 so yes i can see how that section of your post can been seen as blaming the victim
5795397 the issues you raised are the very reason why i no longer see black men as allies or even my
5795398 do i believe that the majority of black men are my enemies no but i do believe that only a small minority have true respect for black womanhood most black men id say fall in the middle of both extremes not haters but certainly not lovers of black women
5795399 i also agree that black women have fed into this dynamic too many of us are concerned about black boys and men but not nearly enough about black girls and women that has to change
5795400 mentally everyone will have to work to change some of their views or else were really just working to reinvigorate a script that has gotten us to where we are now in the first place
5795401 i think we all need to see some changes in the dc universe that are substantive it is time for dc to move in the right direction
5795402 the ground was totally covered in weeds so we had to dig everything up three times
5795403 we just had kids flocking over asking whats going on

5795409 this is an area where families with members on both sides of the border can get together on the beach and have a picnic or bring a new born baby to show to a relative on the other side
5795410 all that will be lost if this new fence is built
5795411 if its like the fencing put up elsewhere along the border near san diego there will be two fences made with triple strength concertina wire
5795412 there will be one fence 150 meter dead zone thats big enough for a vehicle to drive and then the second fence
5795413 ninety percent of illegal migrants on that part of the border come through a legal port of entry either smuggled in a vehicle crated in tractor trailers or they come legally and overstay their visa
5795414 the logic of building the fence makes very little sense
5795415 i was detained for visiting a park where north meets south and the pacific crashes against the land a park that i have visited all of my life
5795416 i was detained for bearing witness to the ongoing destruction of that park for a triple fence will bypass the last place where families can still come together and see each other through the wall of death that separates our families and communities
5795417 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyze search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us

5795423 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
5795424 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5795425 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5795426 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5795427 at its peak ipv6 represented less than one hundredth of 1 percent of internet traffic
5795428 this is somewhat equivalent to the allowed parts of contaminants in drinking water
5795429 we believe this is the largest study of ipv6 and internet traffic in general to date by several orders of magnitude
5795430 though not a landslide of adoption it is still something
5795431 the us has historically been quite sluggish and most ipv6 research and implementation has been in europe and asia
5795432 two or three years ago you could make the argument that the exhaustion of ipv4 addresses is far enough away that we dont need to make the investment
5795433 now is the time for large isps and content providers to begin their migration
5795434 this massive expense comes without the lure of additional revenue since ipv6 offers diminishingly few incentives nor new competitive features to attract or upsell customers
5795435 they can suffer problems through corporate mergers because both parties might be using the same address space or they find they have a lot of network address translators which can make it challenging to deploy new applications ipv6 helps both those problems

5795443 the child must know not only how to read but also how and when to talk about what he or someone else has read
5795444 the point here is that in order to understand literacy it is important to examine particular events where reading and writing are used focusing on the particular is an integral part of an ecological approach this is different from other approaches which place an emphasis on broad generalizations

5795490 like they my classmates go to the bars and im not really interested in that i just havent been and there are lots of people who are interested in that
5795491 like when we come into class and when were down having our lunch oh hi come on over come and sit down i would do that to one of them but they wouldnt do that to me
5795492 i think everyone sort of felt accepted and there was never like if we had to do group work or work on a project together there was never anyone who was like oh i dont have a group or didnt feel like they belonged
5795493 after the classmates parent died there were people who attended the funeral which after knowing somebody for 6 months i thought was extraordinary the students at her school practice teaching placement phoned everybody to just let everybody know
5795494 its really not that hard theres no need to leave the program
5795495 i talked to my group which was actually from both cohorts and they encouraged me and actually called a meeting to talk about it they didnt know what was going on they just encouraged me
5795496 what i mean to say is that obviously there are some friendships in the cohort that are stronger than others and theres a few like that for myself that i consider friends there are a few cliques in the group
5795497 i think everyone sort of felt accepted and there was never anyone who was like oh i dont have a group or didnt feel like they belonged im generally a pretty shy and quiet person but i still felt very comfortable in that class
5795498 prime example of how our class maybe had pulled together
5795499 were here to support each other were going to get to know each other
5795500 you know what like it almost killed me last year to get through that and i dont know if i could get through a second year without that support of the cohort there
5795501 i dont know what i would have done without that support of my cohort section from year 1 but i also think that it would have been really neat to meet some of these other people i e from the other section that we dont know
5795502 im not speaking to her can you believe it she told me i was a liar

5795515 youve got to have the right environment to invite investment in innovation to invite investment in development
5795516 this is my political statement of the day theres really only one country where i dont see this attitude this one the u s
5795517 we dont focus as hard as we should at incentivizing investment and innovation the lapse of the r amp d tax credit is enough of a political statement today where the government refuses to acknowledge that investing in r amp d is important to the future competitiveness of the u s everyone else in the world is recognizing that
5795518 since the wiimote can track sources of infrared ir light you can track pens that have an ir led in the tip by pointing a wiimote at a projection screen or lcd display you can create very low cost interactive whiteboards or tablet displays since the wiimote can track up to four points up to four pens can be used it also works great with rear projected displays

5795520 there are over 6 billion people of people on the planet and it doesnt matter how old you are the cards are always shuffling and there is someone out there for each of us no matter what our age but how do we choose someone who is potentially a good fit and what qualities do we look for there is such a high rate of divorce unhappy marriages and infidelity that it seems many of us we are not choosing someone for the qualities that can make a relationship last a life time in fact many of us find ourselves marrying for the wrong reasons perhaps we are scared to be alone so settle for someone who is nearly but not quite right for us or perhaps their money makes us feel safe or that they are so attractive that they will look great on our arm but none of these qualities will sustain us for a lifetime

5795555 cnn contacted me about this whole thing theyre doing for the election trying to encourage people to vote and they told us they were approaching chris for the project
5795556 im a big fan of his hes got a great voice and i thought it would be a really good idea so i just gave my blessing to the project and they took it from there
5795557 i think people have come to realize what a big mistake the last time theyd voted was it might have been anyway there are two very viable candidates as far as im concerned and there is one who will be a revolutionary candidate in a way and change the direction of america and i think the more people that get out there to vote thats extremely important
5795558 its a song that requires a really strong voice to carry it off and hes got the range and the power to really do it convincingly
5795559 i dont think there are that many singers around at the moment that could really nail it out of all the singers of that style hes the strongest hes just a great singer all around it doesnt matter what style it is he could pretty much sing anything
5795560 i think its not too far away from the original
5795561 theyve modernized it a bit brought it up to todays standards with the sound and arrangement too when i heard it it made me think back to when we recorded the original it was pretty exciting at the time and i sort of got the same feeling when i heard chris version
5795562 at this point no one is taking responsibility for which law is holding him there
5795563 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening

5795594 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make
5795595 opposing the war in iraq was as tough a decision that ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill
5795596 it was long ago and far away in a prison camp in north vietnam my father was a high ranking admiral the vietnamese came and said that i could leave prison early and we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture i also had a dear and beloved friend who was from california by the name of ed alvarez who had been shot down and captured a couple years before me but i wasnt in good physical shape in fact i was in rather bad physical shape
5795597 so i said no now in interest of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so but i said no and ill never forget the high ranking officer who offered it slammed the door and the interrogator said go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now and it was but it was not only the toughest decision i ever made but im most happy about that decision than any decision ive ever made in my life it took a lot of prayer it took a lot of prayer

5795599 federal correctional officers like jose rivera courageously put themselves in harms way every day officer riveras death will not be in vain these two murderers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent under federal law
5795600 the bureau of prisons would like to thank and commend the united states attorneys office for their diligence in bringing this case forward this is an important first step in what we hope will be a relatively short process of bringing some closure to this tragic event we would also like to thank the fbi and our own bureau of prisons staff who were instrumental in the investigation of this murder
5795601 obamas statements regarding the supreme court were ludicrous they reveal that obama is ignorant of facts and history misunderstands the constitution and contradicts himself in his own alleged criteria for supreme court nominees
5795602 americans who care about the future of the supreme court need to look very carefully at obamas comments because they show what poor judgment and criteria he would use in selecting supreme court justices if he were elected president
5795603 it was clear last night that obamas criteria for selecting supreme court justices are fuzzy lack intellectual coherence and are subject to his own whims
5795604 all this speaks volumes about the kind of judges obama would appoint and the way he would fill several potential vacancies at the supreme court that could arise during the next presidents term in office
5795605 obamas answer about the three wisest people in his life upon whom he would rely heavily in his administration also sheds light on the way he would choose supreme court justices obama said he would consult his grandmother his wife and ted kennedy this is unlikely to yield the highest quality judicial nominees who understand the constitution and the role of judges in our constitutional democracy
5795606 obama started to say that justice thomas didnt have enough experience for the supreme court
5795607 obama is obviously ignorant of the fact established through the blackmun papers and independent journalists and scholars that justice thomas has been a leading intellect on the court from day one including an influence on justice scalia whom obama credited with intellectual brilliance
5795608 apparently obama can do no better than to recycle discredited statements of harry reid when it comes to justice thomas like other liberal elites obama cannot stand it when a black man strays from the ideological plantation and refuses to implement liberal policies through the courts but obama will never point out any intellectual deficiencies in justice thomass work because he cant justice thomass opinions consistently reveal faithfulness to the constitution judicial modesty and deference to the will of the people in our representative democracy that is opposed to everything that obama and the liberals are trying to do in grabbing power from the people and giving it to the courts

5795610 code pink at a mock war crimes tribunal in istanbul june 27 signed a declaration that the iraqi insurgency deserved the support of people everywhere who care for justice and freedom
5795611 we must begin by really standing with the iraqi people and defending their right to resist i can remain myself against all forms of violence and yet i cannot judge what someone has to do when pushed to the wall to protect all they love the iraqi people are fighting for their country to protect their families and to preserve all they love they are fighting for their lives and we are fighting for lies
5795612 sure why do we have bases in the middle east we totally violated the rights of that country why do we get to have bases in the middle east
5795613 barack obama has said he knows he needs to earn the trust of the military when he speaks before the veterans of foreign wars today he could take a giant step toward earning that trust by renouncing jodie evans and her bundled campaign dollars and denounce her support of the iraq insurgency
5795614 the rnc is to be commended for speaking out against evans we hope that they too will join the call for obama to renounce jodie evans

5795644 which existing supreme court justice would you not have nominated
5795645 from 1974 to 1977 thomas was an assistant attorney general of missouri under then state attorney general john danforth
5795646 in 1981 he joined the reagan administration from 1981 to 1982 he served as assistant secretary of education for the office of civil rights in the u s department of education from 1982 to 1990 he was chairman of the us equal employment opportunity commission
5795647 in 1990 president george h w bush appointed thomas to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
5795648 was it that barack obama didnt like justice thomass vote on the recent child rapist case
5795649 was it that barack obama didnt like justice thomass vote on the recent d c gun ban case nope that couldnt be it either barack obama wound up ultimately agreeing with thomas and the majority on that one too
5795650 justice ginsburg on the other hand had issues with the second amendment in that case but you would nominate justice ginsburg senator obama
5795651 did obama disagree with justice thomas on the recent cross burning case virginia v black obamas favorite justice justice ginsburg wrote that cross burning bans are constitutionally suspect justice thomas disagreed and wrote a passionate dissent during oral arguments he said theres no other purpose to the cross no communication no particular message it was intended to cause fear and to terrorize a population does obama take issue with the impassioned thomas dissent

5795662 but it certainly could have a very subliminal effect it could degrade the brand

5795694 i have heard of this place many have fallen into the pit to be maimed or killed the other are overcome by damp gas while digging
5795695 but what if the path should lead us out of the way
5795696 im vain confidence this path goes to the celestial city
5795697 has vain confidence fallen into a deep pit made by the prince of this world to catch overconfident fools
5795698 i am despair you are trespassing my grounds of doubting castle you must come with me
5795699 my wife diffidence counsels me to beat you without mercy
5795700 life holds only bitterness ill give you a choice of a knife a rope or poison
5795701 the life we now live is miserable my soul chooses strangling by rope rather than life
5795702 the lord of the country to which we are going has said you shall not murder
5795703 and for one to kill himself is to murder body and soul at once and have you forgotten the hell that awaits murderers
5795704 these were pilgrims who trespassed on my grounds as you have done i tore them into pieces within ten days i will tear you apart just as i have done to these pilgrims before you
5795705 what a fool ive been to lie in this stinking dungeon
5795706 i have a key in my bosom called promise that is supposed to open any lock
5795707 they are within sight of his city these sheep belong to him he laid down his life for them
5795708 is the way to the celestial cit safe or dangerous
5795709 safe for some but the rebellious stumble in the way
5795710 is there in this place nay rest for the weary
5795711 the lord of these mountains told us do not forget to entertain strangers
5795712 these men listened to hymenaeus and philetus who said the resurrection of the faithful had already taken place
5795713 they are some of despairs victims at doubling castle he rips out their eyes and they wander to fulfill the proverb a man who strays from the path of understanding comes to rest in the company of the dead
5795714 for hypocrites like esau who sold his birthright or like judas who sol his master or like alexander who blasphemed the gospel or like the liars ananias and sapphira
5795715 and peace be with your helper how has it fared with you my friends since our last parting
5795716 that you have been victors the day is coming when both he who sows and they who are reaped shall rejoice together hold fast let no man take your crown you are not out of gunshot of beelzebub
5795717 we well know you are a prophet tell us what is going to happen to us
5795718 you must go through many tribulations t enter into the kingdom of heaven you will soon come into a town and you will be beset wit enemies who will strain hard to kill you one or both of you will seal your testimony with blood but be faithful unto death and the king will give you the crown of life he who shall die there will arrive at the celestial city sooner and escape many miseries of the rest of the journey
5795719 this man is one of the vilest men in our country he has no regard for prince or people law or custom he does all he can to persuade all men of his principles of faith and holiness i heard him say christianity and the customs of jour town are diametrically opposite and could not be reconciled if any charge be lacking i will be glad to enlarge my testimony against him
5795720 i have no great acquaintance with this man but i did hear him say that the people of vanity worship in vain are in sin and shall be damned
5795721 i have heard him rail not only against our noble prince beelzebub but or princes honorable friends carnal delight luxurious vain glory lechery and greedy he called you judge and ungodly villain
5795722 you will be slain immediately after the proceedings yet so all men may see our gentleness to you let us you hear what you have to say
5795723 in answer to envys charge i only said that any prince or people or law or custom against the word of god is also against christianity lord have mercy on me
5795724 how far do you go this way and where are you from
5795725 im going to the celestial city im from the town of fair speech i have many rich relatives there in particular lord turn about lord time server and lord speech himself also smooth man facing both ways and two tongues and my wife is a very virtuous woman from a very honorable family its true we differ in religion from those of a stricter sort yet only on two small points first we never strive against wind and tide secondly we are most zealous when religion goes in his silver slippers we love to walk with him in the street if the sun shines and people applaud him
5795726 that is not my name it is a nickname given to me by those who cannot stand me i must be content to lbear that reproach i never gave an occasion to earn the name i have always been lucky thats all
5795727 if you go with us you must go against wind and tide and you must be loyal to religion in rags as well as silver slippers
5795728 nor lord it over my faith let me go with you in freedom
5795729 i wont desert my principles ill wait until someone comes along who will be glad of my company
5795730 suppose a minister or a tradesman had an opportunity to get the good blessings of life but only if he had to become very zealous on some point of religion he never bothered with before may he not get the blessings and still be an honorable man
5795731 lets take the minister first if he can benefit from such a small alteration of principle i see o reason why he cant do it and still be an honest man after al the desire for blessings is lawful and the opportunity is set before him by providence beside his desire makes him a more studious a more zealous preacher his people wont mind if he denies to serve them some of his principles that will prove he has self denying temperament now as to the tradesman suppose such a one has a poor business but by being religious he can improve his market maybe even get a rich wife i see no reason why this is not lawful to become religious is a virtue nor is it unlawful to get a rich wife by becoming good himself he gets a good wife and good customers and good profit
5795732 only incite violence and hatred and result in adverse consequences
5795733 malaysia takes a serious view on this issue and if it is allowed to continue then the responsibility falls on germany

5795735 our dog is good and vigilant but he is one dog and the wolves are many the wolves he catches are not always killed and the master judges and releases many to prey again upon us for no reason we can understand what can we do we are sheep but we do not wish to be food too
5795736 it is his teeth and claws that make the wolf so terrible to us it is his nature to prey and he would find any way to do it but it is the tools he wields that make it possible if we had such teeth we could fight back and stop this savagery
5795737 baaaaaaaadddd baaaaaddd things you have bad things we are afraid you are not sheep
5795738 we are still sheep but we do not wish to be food see our new teeth and claws protect us and have saved us from slaughter they do not make us into wolves they make us equal to the wolves and safe from their viciousness
5795739 baaaaaaddddd you still possess these evil things we must ban you from our presence
5795740 it is our pasture too and we have never harmed you when can you say we have caused you hurt it is the wolves not we who prey upon you we are still sheep but we are not food
5795741 baaaaaaddd we will not hear your clever words you and your things are evil and will harm us
5795742 truly these sheep are fools they have told us they have no teeth brothers let us feed
5795743 see if the wolves know you have no teeth they will fall upon you why be prey to be a sheep does not mean to be food for wolves
5795744 baaaaaaaadddd these things are bad if they were banished the wolves would not harm us baaaaaaaddd
5795745 if we discover a desire within us that nothing in this world can satisfy also we should begin to wonder if perhaps we were created for another world

5795798 i can get myself back to work faster in doing this trial and other people might see this and itll help them in the future
5795799 we have seen at first hand how people who were our neighbours in west yorkshire became involved in violent extremism resulting in terrible loss of life on 7 july 2005 we need to do more to stop people from taking those first steps into the world of violent extremism

5795805 dear rick thanks for the invitation to appear the same night as my friend john mccain at your church i get alot of invitations though and will be appearing elsewhere that evening
5795806 it might not register that its really land at this point

5795812 each tyranid is a living weapon perfectly adapted to its designated function but each creature is no more than a single cell in a galactic entity governed by a monstrous hive mind as the tyranid hive fleets drift through space they strip all life from the worlds in their path leaving nothing but scoured rock in their wake in the war zones of warhammer 40 000 the tyranids are instinctive masters of swarm tactics and close combat frequently appearing by the thousands across untold numbers of world they always outnumber their opponents a fact that often guarantees their victory each tyranid is equipped with diamond hard rending claws razor sharp teeth and a variety of other bio weapons suited to both close quarters fighting and ranged attacks whats even more fearsome are the monstrous creatures striding through a tyranid swarm like carnifexes and hive tyrants true behemoths who tower over even the largest of tanks and mechanised units in total the tyranids are a cold and brutal opponent to face even the best warriors in the galaxy can only hope to stall the tyranids advance
5795813 voter registration campaign in his hometown of atlanta ga due to the overwhelming response he announced today the national expansion of the program beginning august 21 2008 in detroit mi
5795814 i wanted to give teenagers more than the experience and satisfaction of registering voters i wanted to give them knowledge that will engage them in our democratic process long after this election ends
5795815 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5795816 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5795817 collegehangover has been a strong partner in our drunk university network
5795818 obviously i favor senator obamas energy positions and democrats have been by and large the more forward leaning actors
5795819 but john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change
5795820 im very encouraged about where the presidential rhetoric is in this campaign
5795821 its a small positive but you still have all the other negatives
5795822 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge
5795823 during these tough times some of our consumers dont want to be tempted as much as they have in the past
5795824 as we look forward into the second half of the year we see continued pressure on our markets
5795825 i ask that my privacy be respected in these difficult times and i believe that the people of the turks amp caicos islands will understand and support my wish to receive the necessary independent representation from the legal counsel of my choosing i hope that in time the turks amp caicos islands government will come to share that view although i have always been a supportive wife even in light of the very serious allegations currently pending against the premier there are limits even for me
5795826 its a small positive but you still have all the other negatives
5795827 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge
5795828 during these tough times some of our consumers dont want to be tempted as much as they have in the past
5795829 as we look forward into the second half of the year we see continued pressure on our markets
5795830 unfortunately the rust has been ineffective in the tropical north so we started investigating the possible introduction of additional strains better adapted to the tropics that would enhance biocontrol in those areas
5795831 thats when the weed threw the team a curve ball
5795832 none of the extra strains would infect australian noogoora burr australian rust strains on the other hand produced severe symptoms so we couldnt establish cultures of these exotic strains and perform the host specificity tests necessary before approval for release could be given plants developed typical resistance reactions when inoculated with the imported strains thats when the detective work began back where the rust strains came from the dominican republic and mexico
5795833 its more complicated than we first thought but we now know the system better and have laid the groundwork for future success
5795834 in future we hope to find out where australian noogoora burr originally came from and look there for pathogenic rust strains if this cant be achieved we will consider establishing an outdoor garden of australian noogoora burr in tropical america to attract suitable rust strains
5795835 lets have a serious debate and lets debate our disagreements on the merits of policy not personal attacks
5795836 i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest
5795837 now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same i will let no one question my love of this country
5795838 i reiterate my demand that russia abide by the cease fire
5795839 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5795840 for three decades as our energy crisis grew decision making in washington has been rigged against our national interests and the interests of american consumers
5795841 and for almost that long senator mccain has been part of the problem for decades he has stood with the big oil companies and voted against the development of the alternative energy we need
5795842 seems to be talking out of both sides of his mouth
5795843 mccain in my personal opinion has more experience on foreign affairs than obama and has served in the military
5795844 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him
5795845 rate each story author and publications credibility which is then plugged into an algorithm to determine the site s prominent headlines
5795846 i try to bring a little levity to the situation and make sure that to the degree we can were enjoying this campaign
5795847 it is important for me to test players like finnan kilbane given steven reid
5795848 i have already said these players are very important for us because they have experience international experience they give us more safety in games
5795849 but i know already players like liam miller in the last game against colombia damien delaney and we have not forgotten the injured paul mcshane
5795850 but at the moment i am happy with the squad because the last time we had only 13 players today we have 22 who are very very strong
5795851 we have to believe we have a strong team like others who have stars italy spain england
5795852 it is certainly up there we have had strong squads over the years but at the moment it is probably as strong as it has been in the last four or five years definitely
5795853 if you look around the players we have and the experience now a lot of players have of playing in the premier league which is always great in the last four of five years it has certainly got a lot stronger
5795854 we have got a chance it is a tough group theres no question but we have as much of a chance as everyone else
5795855 we will take each game as it comes we will wait for the next couple of games and see what happens but we will certainly have a chance like everyone else has
5795856 im very excited i am excited about playing games which every player wants to do
5795857 i love playing i love playing for my country and i am looking forward to the two games coming up and also for liverpool
5795858 but when i am with liverpool i will concentrate on doing what i do for liverpool when i am with the irish team i will concentrate on doing what i do for ireland
5795859 sudans anti terrorism special courts are nothing but a travesty of justice
5795860 some of the people sentenced sunday only met their lawyers for the first time during the trial while several said they suffered torture when they were held incommunicado and that they were forced to confess to crimes
5795861 those trials were clearly unfair and now sudan is preparing to try yet more people with this system how is that justice
5795862 marks of ill treatment were still clearly visible on their bodies
5795863 until such time that the key terms and conditions thereof have been finalised any further comment will be premature
5795864 china sonangol has also entered into agreement with tanzania to develop terminal iii of julius nyerere international airport
5795865 the first seasons harvest has been so poor because of a long dry spell while heavy rains pests and diseases are destroying crops for the second season
5795866 we anticipate tougher periods for idps internally displaced persons and other people in months to come because the food quantity from the first season harvest was inadequate to feed them for the coming months as they await the second harvest that is being badly affected by the rain
5795867 i thought i would get seeds from the first seasons harvest for planting in the second season but there is virtually nothing the long dry season destroyed the beans maize millet and groundnuts that were maturing
5795868 currently the market cannot provide enough for what we need this means there isnt enough food for distribution to idps
5795869 we are currently implementing a food security assessment in gulu and amuru to try to determine crop yield this activity will go on for the next one year to help determine crop yield and requirements for intervention
5795870 pastoralists across east africa are starting to learn to live with the reality of climate change adapting as they can to its impact
5795871 they are not victims of climate change they suffer marginalisation more
5795872 we need to empower them pastoralists by formulating and implementing policies in their favour
5795873 governments in the region have historically had little economic and political interest in promoting pastoralists interests as they tend to see pastoralists as a
5795874 for the past century pastoralists in kenya have suffered the consequences of poor decisions taken by those charged with planning and decision making
5795875 many people say pastoralism is a livelihood which time has passed im happy that is changing
5795876 it is time we came together to address this issue of climate change now time is not on our side
5795877 there is a humanitarian crisis looming in northern kenya as pastoralists have resorted to eating wild fruits and gum arabica to contain hunger this is a community which has been self reliant on food as the majority of them were farmers
5795878 it is about time donors and government reconsider their strategies and empower pastoralist communities by directing funding support to pastoralists institutions
5795879 some eck officers have done some calculations and there are a number of constituencies where the figures differ
5795880 i do not want to commit myself since i did not make this document but i myself have no objection to putting it into evidence
5795881 we want to see it and we are entitled to see it
5795882 the hills have been developed into plush residences and the water that flows from the hills has no natural absorbents for excessive rains which later flows into the valleys
5795883 what can i do this is the only source of water around i could possibly boil it but that is only for drinking water what about washing my dishes
5795884 our water is safe we have a state of the art water treatment plant and we are upgrading our distribution network there is no need for alarm because the water does not have bacterial contamination
5795885 you dont have to worry about the dna going haywire
5795886 the ability to on demand make as much as you want is obviously very very attractive
5795887 we can currently generate up to a 100 billion red blood cells from a single six well plate of stem cells
5795888 the international community has pushed an agenda that has resulted in loss of life and destruction of property
5795889 unfair and insulting to the international community and african leaders who have come forward to help kenya
5795890 i couldnt let them hide behind the mediators any longer
5795891 all that was missing was the village tree this was an african solution to an african problem
5795892 if wed had 5 000 dead the entrenchment of displacement would have reached a point where you could never walk it back and that would have laid the groundwork for genocide later on
5795893 co ordination was particularly intense with us secretary of state condoleezza rice
5795894 i would give the statements to annan and he would approve them before they went out
5795895 became emphatic in backing the power sharing accord annan envisaged
5795896 there is a class issue and a kind of racism in the world i am a kenyan minister and nobody listens to me the election was not rigged the whole world fell for propaganda why should washington run the world
5795897 there was also evidence that some post electoral violence was co ordinated by odm agitators neither side was clean
5795898 was that we cant let this happen to kenya wed seen a lot of destruction in the region rwanda somalia sudan darfur and kenya had been the safe haven for refugees and suddenly kenya itself was going
5795899 ntbs increase the cost of doing business thus rendering the region uncompetitive this defeats eacs integration objective of developing a competitive private sector both in the region and globally
5795900 all undermine the relative competitive advantage of doing business in the region rendering our products unable to compete with cheap and illegal imports and also uncompetitive in export markets
5795901 this is the time for us to react and act to government programmes most times government looks at issues in a broader perspective they are now looking at guns going silent yet the problems of women are increasing and not addressed well
5795902 the government is telling people to go back but it has not looked at the land issue in the north this is a very critical issue big shots in government have taken away all this land
5795903 the ultimate goal in this meeting is to engage the womens movement in the implementation monitoring and follow up of the prdp to ensure that womens needs and interests and gender in equality concerns are considered and that gender equality becomes a priority in the peace recovery and development efforts in northern uganda
5795904 government comes up with its development plans without consulting the people they are planning for we are trying to look at prdp in gender equality and womens perspective which it doesnt recognise in its specific goals
5795905 these sort of images child pornography dont just pop onto your screen you have to go looking for it
5795906 if you dont like it then go back to bangladesh
5795907 canonical is an important new member for the linux foundation
5795908 we are extremely pleased to work even more closely with canonical as we push linux to the next stage of growth
5795909 oversees development and distribution of the most popular desktop linux distribution
5795910 the east african community therefore encourages innovation in branding as this is critical in the ever competitive markets where product differentiation is key determinant in positioning super brands ahead of none branded products
5795911 consumer demands superbrand will help stabilise our branded products and enable them to weather the storms occasionally presented by market dynamics
5795912 i encourage brands in the region to participate in this project as a way for promoting competition and marketing strategies this will only happen when companies deliberately invest in supply chain systems that guarantee stress ability and by fully adopting internationally accepted and recognised systems
5795913 the book is no doubt a marketing tool for the region as an ideal investment destination for domestic and foreign investors
5795914 the fiscal policy interventions can be divided into three broad classes interventions to ensure household food security by strengthening targeted safety nets interventions to lower domestic food prices through short run trade policy measures or administrative action and interventions to enhance longer term food supply
5795915 current food and energy challenges in africa and the response of the bank and other international institutions
5795916 this mirrors the trends among developed and emerging market countries where capital flows have also surged owing to abundant global liquidity private equity and debt flows to sub saharan african countries remain small and are estimated at about 53 billion in 2007 compared with total global capital inflows of about 6 4 trillion in 2006
5795917 the question remains how late are we in the game in the credit crisis
5795918 even though the answer over the past few weeks seemed to be pretty late in the game there are still key issues coming up
5795919 that makes it a lot easier to move the averages around especially when the trading is focused on one direction in this case down
5795920 the american consumer has long been the single biggest force propping up the u s and the global economy
5795921 but declining customer satisfaction combined with weaker demand for u s exports may make it difficult for american households to shoulder the burden of being the locomotive for world economic growth
5795922 the problem for domestic companies is that they now lag further behind their foreign counterparts
5795923 this is not going to be helpful as the big three will lose more pricing power and be forced to continue dependence on rebates and discounting in a market where consumer preferences keep shifting away from domestic cars
5795924 jass extensive executive experience provides taser international a critical addition to our management team enhancing strategic oversight of our significantly expanded research and business development programs
5795925 as soon as you mention child pornography everybodys senses go out the window
5795926 i hope to recover my reputation but our friends all ran
5795927 there is no evidence to support the claim that michael fiola was responsible for any of the pornographic activity
5795928 no apparent origin or user interaction preceding the pornographic activity
5795929 while we should have adequate legal safeguards to shield children from objectionable content
5795930 those safeguards cannot unreasonably interfere with the rights of adults to have access to materials that are legal for them
5795931 knowing what we know about artificial intelligences influencing personal computers
5795932 consider measures to encourage or require the use of advanced blocking technologies that are compatible with various communications devices or platforms
5795933 there has never been a time in our nations history when parents have had more tools and methods at their disposal to help them decide what is acceptable in their homes and in the lives of their children
5795934 the current fires in southern california are causing misery to hundreds of thousands of people as is the case with all disasters there are good people rallying to help and bad people trying to exploit the situation for profit it may be a good time to remind people about some best practices to make sure that the money you earmark for helping people goes to helping people
5795935 first of all do not respond to email messages soliciting donations even from legitimate charities these messages often are not sent by the charity itself if you get an email from the american red cross and you wish to donate to this respected organization do not use any information in the email as it may have been sent by a scammer that will redirect you to their fake red cross web site instead look up the phone number for the red cross or open your browser yourself and type in http american redcross org
5795936 a site that can assist you with determining the legitimacy and effectiveness of a charity is http www charitynavigator org
5795937 do not give cash to people claiming to represent charities at lax or other public places a person may approach you claiming to be collecting for victims of this or other disasters they may even have impressive documents that are easily printed on a home pc some of these people are undoubtedly legitimate but unless you are a psychic you probably wont know take the information about the charity they represent and look it up before you part with your money
5795938 a few simple precautions will help prevent you and the victims you seek to help from being victimized
5795939 install onstar systems on almost 1 7 million 2009 model cars
5795940 law enforcement or anyone who cracks the system to remotely shut down vehicles
5795941 ready to turn over the keys of your vehicle to the cops or that clever hacker in the next lane how about that creepy guy following you on a lonely country road
5795942 there are some high speed chases that we have out here that wed like to bring to a halt
5795943 i want to apologize for the results of my conduct on september 21 2007 although i never intended to act in a disorderly fashion i now realize that the shirt i created caused alarm and concern at logan airport
5795944 i am appreciative to the massachusetts state police for their diligence in protecting our citizens and apologize for the expense that was caused that day
5795945 determined that they could not move forward on that count and dismissed it to the disorderly conduct charge
5795946 it also meant i couldnt attend the international symposium on wearable computing as it was held at the hyatt at logan airport
5795947 they have tried their best and the results would have been different had they prepared for the games some years back
5795948 im so happy its unbelievable i wanted to reach the final and now that i have won the gold its really great for my family and great for kenya
5795949 we planned to run as a team and bring the medals with janeth and im happy things went the right way i dedicate my medal to my mother and to all kenyans and i urge parents to encourage their children to take up sports along with education i would not be here if my mother did not encourage me to run
5795950 i told her that since she was the stronger one between us she should just attack the race and go all the way
5795951 im happy the race went that way and im also happy that brimin kipruto won the steeplechase gold medal its a great night for kenya
5795952 i feel great i knew it was my race and i knew if i was in the leading group with 200 metres to go i would beat anybody
5795953 i was inspired to take up athletics by watching the performances of people like former world record holder moses kiptanui winning i wanted it to be a clean kenyan 1 2 3 sweep but unfortunately the frenchman came between us it is strange because i have never seen this man or competed against him before
5795954 i was thrilled along with all kenyans to learn of pamela jelimo and brimin kiprutos feats in winning gold medals for our country at the 2008 olympic games in beijing
5795955 i wish to also congratulate the other champions who won silver and bronze medals yesterday surely more medals are on the way
5795956 so i salute our dear athletes in beijing who have done us proud with their victories i also salute our other athletes who have given their best for the country and won us praise on the world stage as true sportsmen and sportswomen
5795957 they have done us proud in china and we expect more gold medals before the olympics are over although the economy is hard these athletes should be given something by every kenyan of goodwill
5795958 kenya has stamped its authority as a powerhouse in the athletics by that incredible performance the way jelimo ran reminds you of the gazelle in our wildlife reserves
5795959 if the remaining athletes remain focused we shall get at least four golds
5795960 the pace set by jelimo and brimin kipruto is a challenge to the remaining athletes
5795961 if my age could have allowed i could have joined athletics since it is one straight way to riches
5795962 if you have a problem with the government not putting in place policy and regulatory frameworks in place that is another issue and the ministers are here to deal with it but you should not tell us to stop going east african
5795963 we should not discuss protectionism or equality but unity issues of equality are what sank the first east african community because other countries thought that kenya was gaining more
5795964 you should know that some people in government are not doing their work and the private sector is suffering as a result you are basically mortgaging the private sector in this country
5795965 we have been lobbying the government to establish a ugandan reinsurance company for seven years now but in vain the 10 years we ask for are modest
5795966 we cannot guarantee that if we give you that time you will have developed capacity by then on the contrary i think when we open up we shall gain in construction for instance we have a backlog of 80 000 housing units so restricting that sector would make the situation worse
5795967 in uganda the land belongs to the people while in the other countries it belongs to the state so unless this is harmonised we could have a problem according to ugandan law it is not possible for a non national to acquire freehold land we only give leases up to 99 years
5795968 but this is still only a reduction whereas under the customs union these barriers are supposed to be completely eliminated
5795969 we shall advise the nairobi meeting that since there is a negotiated protocol on the customs union that is slated to be reviewed by 2010 any issues in the context of that protocols implementation should be left out of the common market protocol
5795970 i have to say its like insisting the dog ate your homework
5795971 are you going to admit that you downloaded porn to your spouse or employer or to a judge hell no your honor it wasnt me the browser did it
5795972 were good guys now we were never that bad really in fact hey lets be friends
5795973 i came here to the us as political refugee from the former soviet union and now like many other people in the us i feel shame that all of this can happen in the us supposed to be the greatest democracy in the world
5795974 i arrived there to find everyone present and that is why i explained to the president why i had to present him with the certificate
5795975 i have doubts whether continued withholding of results would have guaranteed peace
5795976 for these reasons it is important for federal investigators and prosecutors to bring all available resources to bear upon investigations and prosecutions of internet based crimes against children and for federal prosecutors to substantially increase the number of prosecutions of child pornography and enticement offenses
5795977 all available resources to bear upon investigations and legitimate prosecutions of internet based crimes against children and for federal prosecutors to substantially increase the number of legitimate number of prosecutions of child pornography and enticement offenses

5795979 we had been to waddo geel where we held meetings with the residents on the de mining of that road when we reached arabsiyo centre we stopped to buy something in a shop and a truck nicknamed shambo hayran passed us
5795980 we then drove after it and when we tried to overtake it the people in it turned the truck towards our car forcing our driver hassan kosar to go off the road and hit some trees along the road
5795981 finally there was a third attempt by the same truck at about 12 30pm when it got to abarso 20km west of hargeisa this time the men came out and even slapped us around we chose to downplay the incident in order to save ourselves and we drove off
5795982 as i was speaking to the man a truck drove towards us and suddenly stopped near us someone come out carrying a thick stick and tried to beat hit me on the head but i blocked it using my hand seriously injuring it then the police came and arrested the men in the truck
5795983 after they were arrested we identified them as part of a group of people who attempted to steal scrap metal from our halo trust garage in mid march 2008
5795984 i think we have to do something about the manner in which appointments are done
5795985 the commission should be established in a way that makes it credible
5795986 you must involve others who can play a role in the appointment of commissioners
5795987 if you do that you are likely to create a basis of respect and trust
5795988 i would like to see the eck having its own credibility on the basis of how it is formed and what it does
5795989 integrity is so important for this job to me it is important that they should be of impeccable integrity
5795990 it is no good to appoint people when there is not enough time for them to prepare for the election
5795991 the general election is not something you just wake up and start doing
5795992 we want to make our registers as accurate as possible
5795993 the commission wants to remove dead voters from the current registers and it is only by starting the process afresh that we shall realise this
5795994 we rely on our suppliers to create solutions that deliver greater speed to market ceva accomplished that goal by providing impeccable delivery and customer service
5795995 this award is a reflection of our goal to make business flow for our customers and a result of strong global teamwork and a mutually respectful partnership we are truly honored by this recognition by monster cable and we look forward to a long and successful relationship
5795996 this is a milestone event for the republic of somalia forming somalia petroleum corporation not only provides a firm and transparent basis for developing the oil and gas industry in somalia but it in addition it enables the ministry of energy and mining to tap into the natural resources of the country to generate revenue for its people thereby eradicating the prevailing poverty and eliminating the prevailing instability
5795997 medco is proud to have been the pioneer along with its partner kuwait energy company and a catalyst for building the foundations of the oil industry in somalia the oil and gas industry could prove to be a significant source of income for the government while directly or indirectly reducing unemployment in the years to come leading to the establishment of local somali service companies we look forward to building our relationship in somalia
5795998 we need three additional years and a 10 per cent duty on goods from kenya into uganda be imposed as uganda awaits the generation of extra energy from the bujagali dam
5795999 we need more energy to produce add value and be in position to compete favourably with industrialised kenya
5796000 we make use of the safeguard clause in article 19 of the e ac treaty to apply safeguards in sub sectors where uganda has suffered injury because of the customs union
5796001 on the transfer of customs duties imposed on imports from non eac countries to the final country of consumption no express clause has been provided in the negotiations so far psfu wishes to call for the inclusion of a clause to ensure that duties collected on goods destined for the ugandan market are collected by uganda

5796003 because this is a penal statute with an ambiguous term when it comes to computer technology it must be construed strictly and in favour of the defendant
5796004 a defendant must have fair notice that his conduct is criminal
5796005 because of the ambiguity sufficient notice was not provided here for this reason we are constrained to reverse a previous decision and leave it to the legislature to clarify the language if it intends to make the mere viewing of child pornography a crime
5796006 with the computer savvy folks out there its going to limit our ability to prosecute i would think
5796007 this is a case that says here are the facts that you need
5796008 its nothing serious its one of those training camp things where you get kind of worn out youve just got to get your legs back under you
5796009 would you want a friend or a leader fighting along side of you when you are at war
5796010 when i was a kid there was an ice storm in the suburbs we went to manhattan to stay with a friend of my moms there was nobody on the road it was this moment that couldve been scary for a kid but she made it festive
5796011 thats what nick is like he takes the hard part of a situation and makes it celebratory

5796015 i think it will be ok were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
5796016 everybody was on pins and needles and sort of waiting to see how theyd react they started off kind of tentative but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnecting
5796017 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
5796018 the safety of our players and of our fans comes first and thats obviously one of the biggest factors
5796019 but its a decision that we do consult with other bodies to make sure it works for all
5796020 theres this huge thing right now dealing with a balloon fetish
5796021 its new to me but theres quite a few clients who are into the balloon fetish so we accommodate them
5796022 toronto is on top as far as marketing and sales
5796023 we have the big game companies here we have a lot of well known computer graphics generators here it just stands to reason that some of that would derive into the adult expansions
5796024 the girls are less shy about posing nude in front of a camera or having sex in front of the camera compared to girls from ontario for example
5796025 but the pay was good for that kind of stuff so i decided to do it
5796026 its like a bull session in a university debate club sometimes here in the kitchen except everyones wearing lingerie
5796027 what we all are especially the online community is ex geeks
5796028 ex computer freak geeks nerds the kid who wore the horn rims and got his head kicked in the locker room

5796032 a lot of times you end up being like their therapist
5796033 every once in a while you get someone who is a real jerk who comes in and treats you like garbage
5796034 some people need the big budget illusion of the fake glam babes as we call them they need the makeup they need the boob jobs they need the cheesy music whatever and thats their fantasy

5796045 the disease still ravages millions of africans but it is no longer an automatic death sentence
5796046 unfortunately key congressional subcommittees have approved funding at levels below those set in the bill the budget for foreign aid is insufficient and there are many worthy programs
5796047 co sponsored the bill but has been less vocal about his support
5796048 wonder whether the government should shift resources to fight the disease domestically
5796049 government has underestimated u s hiv aids infections by 40 per year for the past decade

5796146 i think the biggest thing with all these freshmen is they really recruited an athletic class
5796147 this new offense we didnt have any 330 pounders coming in here as freshmen most of them came in at 260 and 270 and are still trying to work their playing weight up
5796148 guys like ricky barnum and pat omameh rocko khoury theyre all athletic guys and i think that puts them in an opportunity if youre 285 pounds and athletic and can move that puts you head and shoulders above an average lineman that cant move at all

5796195 i have two little children and now they have been robbed of their father because of me i know its my fault our marriage went on the rocks and im so miserable about it day in and day out that i just dont know what to do
5796196 you dont know how many times ive wept before the lord i know i was wrong and ive truly repented
5796197 and you know that youre saved that youre a child of god through faith in christ
5796198 thats what makes my mistakes so hard to bear i accepted christ as my savior when i was a child but i got away from him and you make a lot of foolish mistakes when youre not living for the lord now i just hate myself i cant stand myself
5796199 jennifer the bible says in first john 1 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness do you believe that
5796200 yes i know the bible says that and i want to believe it and i guess i do but i cant help hating myself for having made such a mess of my life and of my childrens
5796201 if god forgives you shouldnt you be willing to forgive yourself do you know what jesus said were the two great commandments they are love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and love your neighbor as yourself
5796202 jennifer do you think you can fully obey that command to love your neighbor as yourself if you dont love yourself if you continue hating yourself it will affect all your relationships with your fellow man wont it
5796203 well hatred toward other people should have no part in a christians life jennifer
5796204 certainly we should hate sin as god does but we should also love the sinner as god does and you will not be able to obey the second great commandment unless you forgive yourself and go on from there with the lord all the brooding in the world over your past mistakes will not make you a better christian will it but if you have learned something from your mistakes and if you have rededicated your life to the lord then you can look forward to a future of living for him and training your children in the way they should go do you understand
5796205 it does no good to continue beating yourself over the head

5796337 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5796338 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5796339 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5796340 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5796341 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that

5796343 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future

5796353 instead the iff aimed to tarnish apartheids enemies to paint the anc as the international department of the soviet communist party this was merely a large scale replay of the political entrepreneurship we saw at the usa foundation with jack and the gang yet again hiring themselves out to a wealthy client to perform a hit on a troublesome left wing group

5796362 good news for search engine optimization seo within know public storage is a beast of a company who consistently dominates the top ten map results in google commonly known as a 10 pack well folks it appears there is a light at the end of the proverbial tunnel in a recent interview carter masian the director of product management for google local had this to say regarding what we see as questionable seo tactics by public yes in that case even though there is nothing inherently wrong with a single business ranking prominently in the top results we are working to modify the way we handle cases like that the challenge spans multiple areas around the quality of the data the way we index it the way we score it and the way we present the ui in showing it whats that mean for google re weighting their algorithm and all the back end work that that implies and what does that mean for those of us who know how much the 10 pack affects local search and want users to get the best information and the best experience possible frankly its great news to see that users will get a more authentic experience with their maps and we are happy to see google still keeps the user experience in mind

5796367 every time ive compromised ive lost when i held firm i won the problem with too many environmentalists today is that they are trying to write the compromise instead of letting those we pay to compromise do it they think they get power by taking people to lunch or being taken to lunch when in reality they are only being taken
5796368 we believe our actions served the best interest of justice
5796369 well everyone understands the meaning of justice and thats all were going to say
5796370 it sure looks like these groups simply wanted to avoid the politically explosive issue of cove mallard
5796371 the betrayal of the wilderness society on this point is devastating
5796372 if the country need lumber and timber jobs the cove mallard isnt such a bad place to get it
5796373 the northern rockies chapter of the sierra club which covers all of idaho and some of eastern washington never opposed timber sales in the cove mallard because the area is mostly flat
5796374 basically the intent of the task force was to expedite timber sales in idaho roadless areas by circumventing nepa
5796375 gehrke and baird were there to put a green stamp on illegal timber sales
5796376 we trust the forest service to abide by the law
5796377 did this voluntarily we didnt want to come between working people and their jobs
5796378 sometimes youve got to come promise in the face of political reality
5796379 maybe the lawsuit was ill timed considering the new political atmosphere
5796380 but it was a good suit a necessary action giving up the injunction so quickly sent the worst possible political and legal message
5796381 salmon arent endangered there are cans of them on the shelf at albertsons
5796382 i dont want to pick a fight with these guys
5796383 not only did gehrke help nullify an effective injunction that had stopped the cove mallard sale for at least a few more months
5796384 but he offended a friendly judge forced roselle and fullum to sacrifice themselves and show the opposition just how weak the national environmental groups really are
5796385 essentially what we need the government to do is get out of the way let the market system work get some certainly into the west side timber supply because we dont know whether to build another plant here to go to canada or even whether we should be hiring folks for a month from now because we cant be assured that our veneer supplier are going to have the raw material were going to need
5796386 the wilderness societys founders aldo leopold and bob marshall believed that progress in environmental protection required radical political and economic changes
5796387 but the new wilderness society through its repeated actions has refused to challenge a system where our public resources are controlled by renegade public agencies and multinational corporations a system that assumes that our natural resources exist solely for the purpose of making money the wilderness societys corporate motto is whatever you do dont offend anyone
5796388 little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things
5796389 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

5796394 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing

5796436 if the prosecutions case was so weak why did johnnie cochran argue in his summation that jurors disregard the evidence the reaction of so many american blacks to the verdict was unseemly and offensive one of the jurors a former member of the black panther party gave the black power salute
5796437 only a nation of fools would lull itself into believing that this was not a racially motivated and a racist verdict

5796450 mi previsi n a inicios de a o era de m s de 1 8 millones de nuevos empleos hasta diciembre estoy seguro de que batiremos la marca de 2 0 millones de personas con empleos registrados
5796451 el mayor saldo registrado en ese per odo en todos los a os de la serie
5796452 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
5796453 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 per cent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
5796454 millions of people depend on freshwater fisheries as a major food source
5796455 freshwater food stocks can provide up to 80 per cent of dietary protein for the 60 million people of the mekong basin for example and thats just one river
5796456 freshwater systems are home to around 40 per cent of all the species on earth
5796457 and our impact is shown by the fact that we are losing these species faster than any other
5796458 a global treaty for co operatively managing rivers and lakes that cross or form borders is still languishing in limbo more than a decade after being approved by a clear majority in the united nations
5796459 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
5796460 maintaining the health of freshwater ecosystems has to become one of the major aims of freshwater management generally
5796461 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaption to climate change rather than doing it
5796462 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future
5796463 it is ironic that currently it is not foresight and planning but major natural disasters that lead to significant efforts to repair damaged rivers and wetlands foresight and planning now will reduce the risk and damage from future extreme weather events while having many economic social and environmental benefits
5796464 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely
5796465 many of the developed industrialised countries are not very keen on coming forward with strong commitments post 2012 without knowing what the us is doing
5796466 we could do some practical good work at this stage
5796467 if i could be the dictator of the world it would come out as minus 30 that would be what we should aim for for 2020
5796468 but as you know i am not the dictator of the world
5796469 my hope is to see if we can make it a little more binding
5796470 making decisions has never been my strong point when faced with a chocolate eclair or a macaroon i dither and procrastinate and end up nibbling on both
5796471 the theme is oh just buy both embedded in there is permission to be a little self indulgent its a bit of glamorous self indulgence
5796472 unless we see a rapid and improved turnaround in weather conditions in the next week growers are looking at severe yield losses
5796473 the mass flooding weve seen in carlow town limerick dublin and in belfast can almost certainly be related to the changing weather patterns as predicted by climate change experts
5796474 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
5796475 global warming will leave things like this in the dust
5796476 the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
5796477 these results suggest that a portion of corn stover could be harvested for biofuel production without reducing soil organic carbon levels in high yielding systems however since this study did not study the direct impact of stover removal that aspect remains to be evaluated
5796478 there were a couple of times when they told us to just shut up
5796479 my sisters and brothers wont even talk to me anymore
5796480 we have no comment on specifics but we want to be clear noble supports open and transparent development of wind projects in accordance with the highest ethical standards
5796481 i feel as a mother as a grandmother that the country needs it not just here
5796482 we see this industry coming we see the payments coming in
5796483 there is no decision you are going to make that is going to make everyone happy
5796484 our experience is that sharing waters are more commonly a point of cooperation rather than conflict and we will continue to work in this area given the increasing demand for water
5796485 this essential treaty has been stalled for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5796486 most of the worlds trans boundary river basins lack adequate legal protection and the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5796487 take ethiopia and egypt which have negotiated trade agreements following the nile basin initiative
5796488 now some of the poorest countries in africa which border the river nile cooperate on managing the water resources in turn contributing to peace and stability economic growth and tackling climate change this is a result of recognising a common not conflicting resource
5796489 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are
5796490 what is really frustrating is to have a second devastating fire occur in the same area under basically the same conditions despite the amount of information that has been made available over the years through public education programs that promote defensible space
5796491 it will consider opening portions of the offshore outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5796492 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
5796493 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5796494 cest une grande perte pour le continent africain qui appr ciait son courage politique
5796495 cest une grande perte pour la d mocratie dont il fut un ardent d fenseur tout au long de sa vie la france salue sa m moire vibrante de courage et de libert
5796496 its a big resource its got a good cost curve and its not getting enough attention
5796497 these are combining to create a kind of a perfect storm that we have going on right now
5796498 you see it in rising food prices rising energy prices and a great land grab to produce biofuels the easiest way to grow these crops is to grab lands in the tropics from rainforests
5796499 meanwhile the developing world sees climate change as a train crashing through their countries but something that is not their fault
5796500 forests fall because they are worth more cut down than standing this is a classic example of a market failure
5796501 philanthropy and taxes by governments arent going to be enough to fund forest conservation efforts on the kind of scale thats going to be needed to have a real impact
5796502 but for a market 10 15 billion is quite manageable thats about what we drink in wine and champagne every year in britain for a fraction of the percent of the three trillion dollar a year insurance business we could save forests
5796503 the central issue in this whole debate is how we put a true value on standing rainforest to the world community
5796504 the indigenous communities probably have the best track record of any group in looking after their forests and preventing deforestation
5796505 the problem that we face is that under the redd mechanism being developed by the un there is a danger that these groups wont see compensation because they have a low deforestation baseline and are therefore not emitting
5796506 we need to think about how these communities who have succeeded in protecting their forests should get paid as i see it a method for this is the ecosystem services they are providing the world
5796507 the world is waking up to this and will drive capital to the canopy
5796508 how much money would you be prepared to pay governor braga of amazonas to keep the rain coming
5796509 a primary driver of deforestation is agribusiness in the amazon
5796510 why did this investment happen the very first in the world in iwokrama
5796511 okay so you are going to pay people for ecosystem services now that is just paying people to do nothing so youre going to pay them not to cut down their trees what are they going to do sleep in hammocks and drink beer
5796512 we dont need too much we are happy for our capital to be employed and will take a small return
5796513 well that means all the money will go to aaa
5796514 the market is not perfect there is going to be good guys and bad guys
5796515 im not buying bad palm oil any more im only going to take good palm oil
5796516 weve got mounds of evidence that an extremely powerful and unprecedented climate driven change is underway
5796517 these changes are underway and there are more changes coming
5796518 its easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
5796519 i want it be easier for rich people to get in we need to tax them more for their own good
5796520 not my dog must be the owner please occupy your time trying to help humanity by studying volunteering or just talking to your neighbors instead of walking your poop machine and donate the money for their care to help actual people come on
5796521 no give it all to me in bills that way they are the ones wholl be stuck with the change
5796522 talking down the jumbo jet theory which btw the mythbusters proved could be done so a warmonger would attack famine by first trying to determine if the was a warlike way to deal with it unless he was then willing to search other means of dealing with the situation he would fail
5796523 we feel terrible for izzy because we know how much a part of the club he was
5796524 its obviously going to put some more weight on other players to carry the load
5796525 we feel terrible for izzy because we know how much a part of the club he was
5796526 its obviously going to put some more weight on other players to carry the load
5796527 the fact is if you want to be in leadership in congress youve got to demonstrate youre a leader not just on policy or subject matter expertise but in doing the things that get you in the majority
5796528 in early may 2003 a sensitive source gave coalition forces a box of chemicals he claimed the iis m16 preparation division was researching the chemicals were meant for assassinations or to assist in kidnapping
5796529 not only is compound 1080 one of the most concentrated deadly poisons on earth with no known antidote it is also horrifically cruel causing a long agonizing death
5796530 but i have never spoken to him about the pending bill or about compound 1080
5796531 our concern is that the interest in the carbon value of forests could lead to a land grab motivating outside actors to come in and take over forest areas and drive local people off their land
5796532 we initially hypothesized that proximity to a highway would affect less affluent mothers to a greater extent than affluent ones we thought that less affluent mothers living near a highway would disproportionally suffer from the double burden of economic disadvantage and pollution
5796533 the impact of exposure to additional risk factors like traffic related air pollution among disadvantaged mothers may not be as significant as it is among affluent mothers who are relatively protected from these well identified risk factors
5796534 most managers become managers because they have mastered the hard skills needed for a specific job unfortunately most havent mastered the soft skills of interpersonal relations
5796535 a study in march 2008 by colorado state university and regis learning solutions compared the three leading training programs in interpersonal skills study participants said that the social style model is easier to understand and use than the other two programs and it outperforms them in terms of workplace training
5796536 i said you know im agnostic but if you can do something please do it
5796537 the question is how to get this growth so that it is not a problem
5796538 you have to ask is this a need or a demand
5796539 of course this is not just a discussion for spain it happens in california it happens in portugal in greece in italy what we are trying to introduce is a new message with the tradition that there is a message of cost a message of responsibility and a message of scarcity included in how we plan
5796540 its the height of hypocrisy for zaragoza to be having an expo that touts water sustainability
5796541 zaragoza is one of the biggest culprits in what ails spain too many farmers using too much irrigated land
5796542 but ought it to the answer is a fairly clear no
5796543 it should also give some room for thought in the united states as to how do we take care that our companies do not lag in this green revolution
5796544 if you are worried about job creation then maybe what ford is experiencing an us 8 7 billion loss in one quarter is not the trail to follow
5796545 i think there are some very strong growth signals in these results stronger than i can ever remember seeing in vestas
5796546 in particular i want to highlight the order book of 7 2 billion i might have bid 5 5 billion if i had been optimistic
5796547 somebody has to be first on the dance floor and so we started
5796548 look i am not an apologist for chinas environmental record its record and legacy are a traumatic one
5796549 but we have all seen the efforts being made at these olympics and they hold promise a bit less judgment for what chinas progressive leaders are trying to do might be appropriate at this stage
5796550 china did not start planting trees at the olympics that began 20 years ago now it is one of the only asian countries where forest cover is increasing the chinese have proven to themselves they are capable of far reaching innovation
5796551 china has some of the worst environmental problems in the world but it is paying more attention to both pollution and degradation they realise environmental degradation affects economic development
5796552 this should give the reformers and progressive environmental groups in the government far greater possibility for influence
5796553 people in beijing are not going to forget that the air can be cleaner
5796554 i have based my assessment on the empirical evidence i have no reason to doubt that the numbers are genuine
5796555 ive been to beijing a lot and walked outside so i felt the difference and subjectively if you compare it to an average day in nairobi you can taste more sulphur in the air there
5796556 i see china accelerating environmental efforts much more than other developing nations
5796557 improvement does not mean you have reached an optimum state of affairs though
5796558 people throughout the world see new zealand as a green untouched and beautiful country this is what our two largest industries tourism and food production are in large part built upon
5796559 we have a natural advantage over other countries in the world in this regard and we can and should continue to use it as a point of differentiation because consumers are increasingly making their purchasing decisions based on environmental factors
5796560 but im not playing d amp d in my mothers basement
5796561 my client didnt have any hesitation in saying go for it
5796562 il figlio di catherine zeta jones e michael douglas vuole fare lattore
5796563 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5796564 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5796565 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5796566 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5796567 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5796568 we have done a lot of work on cutting down emissions and saving energy hebeis effort in cutting down emissions and saving energy has contributed a lot to improving beijings air quality
5796569 theres a huge amount happening on the environmental front related to chinas sense of what it means to be a developed nation and part of being developed is to have a pleasant and healthy environment
5796570 that intertwines with the olympics because part of the point of the olympics is to show weve made it
5796571 on the surface the shutdowns were for the olympics governments told polluting steel mills that if they shut voluntarily now they would be allowed to reopen later
5796572 but under this superficial reason there is a deeper economic root cause the biggest problem is transportation because everything has slowed down but also costs of production are going up margins are disappearing and cash is tight
5796573 the olympics has not been a very normal period so data from july are not representative of what economic performance will be in the fourth quarter
5796574 ive been involved in coastal research and coastal management in tasmania now for 30 years working both on shore birds and sea birds and in the 30 years that ive been involved in ive seen at a state level average a loss of 50 per cent of the numbers of birds and the mix of birds
5796575 there are birds that i remember seeing in the 80s that i havent seen now for 20 years
5796576 the sea was red with these jellyfish and there was nothing we could do about it absolutely nothing
5796577 there is actually very little known about jellyfish despite the fact that jellyfish blooms may be increasing because of overfishing and climate change which could have huge socio economic impacts
5796578 in 20 years time we may be looking at jellyfish and chips rather than fish and chips
5796579 i think they must be feeling under pressure on this issue because theres not one authority which really supports the retention of this target now that the decision has been made to introduce an emissions trading scheme
5796580 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5796581 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism
5796582 fix reason firmly in her seat and call to her tribunal every fact every opinion
5796583 question with boldness even the existence of a god because if there be one he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear those facts in the bible which contradict the laws of nature must be examined with more care and under a variety of faces
5796584 millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined imprisoned
5796585 to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
5796586 are a subject of accountability to our god alone i inquire after no mans and trouble none with mine nor is it given to us in this life to know whether yours or mine our friends or our foes is exactly right
5796587 written in so small a print and posted so high that no one can read them
5796588 our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinion any more than our opinions in physics or geometry
5796589 one doesnt feel today as if there is an international official unaffiliated with his countrys national agenda who can be relied upon to be sent into a crisis suss the scene and while not a miracle worker max out on what can be achieved through negotiations through the mobilization of international resources sergio was a hell of a salesman once he got back to capitols etc
5796590 why destroy the people who are with us this is not imperialism or a foreign invasion i tell my brothers that if there was a benefit and a need to carry arms i will be the first to arm you train and fight along with you
5796591 from today bahanga and i are at your disposal we consider libya alone can resolve the rebellions in mali and niger
5796592 i think he must have been pretty embarrassed were planning to frame the notice
5796593 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship
5796594 but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual
5796595 if these decisions are in fact taken on behalf of the georgian aggressor we will not be able to maintain the quality and the schedule of our relationship with nato
5796596 we have a serious temptation to bring all our potential cooperation with nato under question
5796597 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message that is its military power
5796598 i think the french will undoubtedly be seeking from the russians an explanation for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5796599 were reinforcing the point that they are safely within the transatlantic structures
5796600 thats just to remind people that russia is a far cry in terms of its geostrategic centre from where the soviet union was
5796601 i think everybody recognises that this is not the first time that weve seen this problem
5796602 weve had russian strategic aviation challenging even along borders with the united states which i might note is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5796603 the hope had been that russia was going to build its foundation and relationships with europe and the united states on the basis of russian
5796604 and reminding people that bears can fly near norway or near alaska and that you can use military force against a small neighbour is not a particularly appealing message or image

5796617 the land were likely to plow up is the land that weve had taking up carbon for decades
5796618 we cant get to a result no matter how heroically we make assumptions on behalf of corn ethanol where it will actually generate greenhouse gas benefits
5796619 theres some conflict due to whats been described as a feeding frenzy for renewable energy in the desert
5796620 if youre going to destroy conservation and pristine lands then yeah how green is it in the end
5796621 were really at the forefront of a discussion that is certainly going to be repeated throughout the state of california and nationally as well
5796622 all of us are going to face this challenge of where to build transmission corridors in a way that is going to impact the local communities as little as possible
5796623 its interesting that we consider some of these areas as pristine and we dont want to put turbines or solar or transmission lines there but they are suitable for housing development theres sort of an irony there
5796624 mccain continues to reject bipartisan compromise because it would roll back massive tax breaks for the oil companies
5796625 that is not putting the country first it is putting the interest of oil companies first
5796626 we have been talking about our energy problems for 30 years
5796627 and john mccain has been in washington for 26 years it is now time for someone sen obama to put the interest of the country ahead of oil
5796628 o homem abriu os olhos e viu a natureza em toda a sua abund ncia e plenitude
5796629 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
5796630 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
5796631 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
5796632 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
5796633 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
5796634 we work very closely with the military particularly along the border region and we would hope and expect that that would continue
5796635 resolving the whither musharraf question may well allow the government in pakistan to now focus on issues of even greater urgency and immediacy like what is happening in the tribal areas
5796636 the new pakistani government may or may not prove to be as reliable of an ally in the global war on terror as president musharraf has been only time will tell
5796637 the war against extremism is bigger than any one person
5796638 whats important here is that we work with pakistan to do what we can to root out these extremists and prevent them from crossing the border in afghanistan and carrying out attacks and from attacking targets within pakistan
5796639 these results suggest that a portion of corn stover could be harvested for biofuel production without reducing soil organic carbon levels in high yielding systems however since this study did not study the direct impact of stover removal that aspect remains to be evaluated
5796640 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
5796641 global warming will leave things like this in the dust
5796642 the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
5796643 its a big resource its got a good cost curve and its not getting enough attention
5796644 it feels great my body does not feel the same on the ground it will be great to get home
5796645 devising a route is the first issue as are altitude and range
5796646 the air cools as you climb and in northern climates the freezing point is reached sooner we also had no anti icing capability
5796647 it isnt fair to compare us to the pioneers of aviation
5796648 but when looking at the logistics of planning about 80 flights leg after leg thats where the achievement is
5796649 the cork industry in general is under attack one could say from alternative wine bottle closures
5796650 if cork growers lose the cash interest they will plant something else jeopardizing the sustainability chain
5796651 we have to sustain demand for cork to maintain the largest natural forest in western europe
5796652 weve got mounds of evidence that an extremely powerful and unprecedented climate driven change is underway
5796653 these changes are underway and there are more changes coming
5796654 the reintroduction of turkey oak and the re invasion of gall wasps into northern europe may simply represent restoration of a previous natural situation
5796655 they didnt have regulations on how you dispose of waste and all these things in those days
5796656 so they didnt build these mills with any of the environmental protections regulations today are tighter on uranium mills than probably any other chemical plant in world
5796657 the u s needs to have at least some degree of production to have security of supply
5796658 these are complex facilities and they require a lot of analysis on our part
5796659 but they also require a lot of design and preparation by the companies
5796660 if they take a look at technical protections built into this mill theyll realize virtually this thing is benign when it comes to environment
5796661 i am very happy and feel honor for the governments appreciation by allocating such special budget for the climate changes mitigation and adaptation
5796662 we think cap and trade is an important way to go
5796663 it fits in better with what other jurisdictions are doing and it guarantees emission reductions
5796664 this is an exploration of an area of emissions trading that could be included in a future program for us
5796665 if farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers in a better way and reduce those emissions that come off their field then were further ahead in terms of the total amount of greenhouse gases that are getting released from human operations
5796666 instead of opening up the soil by tilling it really actively where you get a lot of carbon released and get nitrous oxide released during that process if you keep it closed it keeps the carbon sequestered in the soil
5796667 by growing new trees youre taking carbon out of the air and youre putting it into the wood and sequestering it there
5796668 on a national scale we are 10 per cent of the problem with greenhouse gas emissions but we can be 20 per cent of the solution
5796669 and the pilots that are being identified here in ontario are also things that can be used at the national scale
5796670 society has to recognize farmers are willing to do this but we cant do it were not paid to assist
5796671 this is not a widespread please come on down and sign up routine yet
5796672 action to preserve the remaining areas of natural forest is needed urgently
5796673 around 700 thousand tonnes per year each year tasmanias forests are absorbing 24 of the entire states carbon emissions
5796674 tasmanian forests are a massive contributor to the fight against climate change
5796675 responsible stewardship of land and sustainable management of our forest resources particularly reforestation and reduced deforestation has provided a sink reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5796676 under the kyoto protocol clear felling mature native forests to grow new trees doesnt count as land clearing so carbon emitted from that activity is left out of the ledger the result is that forestry gets a dream run in official emissions statistics
5796677 tasmanias state forests will absorb 31 million tonnes more atmospheric carbon than it will release making them a net sink of carbon over the next 43 years
5796678 given the undeniable urgency in confronting climate change for the forestry industry to continue to emit massive amounts of greenhouse gasses and deplete natures stores of carbon is a climate crime for tasmania to have to wait 22 years for positive carbon benefits from our forests is a major failure of our responsibility to future generations and a very poor example to set for the rest of the world
5796679 tropical forests move more carbon in and out of the atmosphere than any other ecosystem
5796680 there is preliminary evidence that wood smoke could be worse for peoples health than car exhaust pollution
5796681 forestry tasmania roll out the biomass plant idea every year when they are under public pressure about burning in the forests

5796684 bear in mind there is a lot of pessimism about the financial sector in general so when there is eyebrow raising news about lehman option traders are extra vigilant on that stock in particular
5796685 investors are worried about more write downs than originally thought and lehman might be forced to go back to the capital markets to raise funds
5796686 the bonds in which we have invested have not incurred losses but instead have made us more than a billion dollars in the last six months
5796687 its a small positive but you still have all the other negatives
5796688 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge
5796689 during these tough times some of our consumers dont want to be tempted as much as they have in the past

5796713 there will be one day in your 20s when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg
5796714 initially its shocking and you think whoa i have to actually think about what i eat and work out double the amount i did before
5796715 there have continued to be some absolutely brilliant performances by team gb athletes
5796716 it has been another outstanding day and a great gold medal on the track by christine who ran a fantastic race
5796717 this proves everyone wrong in all the things they have been saying about her it has been a very difficult few years for her and for the whole family
5796718 she has proved herself to the whole world she proved herself at the world championships and now she has done it at the olympics i am so proud of her
5796719 if we have to find more money for a particular aspect of the programme then savings will have to be effected elsewhere and everybody involved in the programme understands that
5796720 its the most unbelievable feeling you cross the line and all the pressure and expectation evaporates and its like nothing else youve ever felt
5796721 thats why the emotions come out at the end it just erupts out of you
5796722 its not bad for a wee boy who got his first bmx bike in a jumble sale at the age of seven
5796723 i think weve all been joyously watching the olympics to win at cycling sailing and now on the track today and yet another set of great gold medals today

5796730 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5796731 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5796732 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5796733 a silvery tribute to all that were lost on that fateful day
5796734 were going to be mad at you for no other reason than because we can be and like to see you wonder why
5796735 certainly there will be a lot of changes in our cooperation with nato and we will have changes in the volume the quality and the timeframe in our consultations and meetings
5796736 whatever the outcome russia has all but obliterated georgias possibility of joining nato as it cannot belong to this alliance if it has unresolved border disputes

5796763 the shield is a purely defensive installation not aimed against anyone
5796764 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
5796765 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
5796766 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5796767 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
5796768 this work represents a radical improvement over prior work presented by this firm in incorporating a protective layer that drastically lowers the solar absorptance to an acceptable value
5796769 the variable emittance electrochromic technology is an entirely new technology pioneered by this firm to the best of our knowledge no other group has done any work in this area

5796778 so its a big responsibility but ive adapted real well and ive been blessed to be able to go hard in practice have fun and make plays so this has been my best camp
5796779 the coaches have been around the game for a long time and you just have to trust that they can put you in the best position for you to play so that you can be helpful to the team
5796780 youve got to have a good special teams core and the coaches trust me with that ive been doing it since ive been here so im used to it now and i have fun doing it its a sure way to know that youre going to play in the game
5796781 i just pull zach around and tell him what to do and then call the play or make the audible checks for the rest of the defense

5796805 hezbollah is practicing a calm policy of overture toward the sunni political and religious forces especially since last may against the sunni future movement to save the image the party has developed in the past as an islamic resistance in the arab and muslim world including in the arab gulf jordan egypt saudi arabia and the palestinian territories
5796806 this move didnt come out of the void but after many meetings away from media between representatives of hezbollah and some salafist groups
5796807 but we have some reservations concerning the attack against the sunnis in may
5796808 iranian pasdaran and hezbollah have already started bringing salafist groups to lebanon from other countries to be trained and then sending them to arab gulf countries to deploy them for the greater battle to come against the united states and its allies

5796813 yes its true sometime within the next two months ann and i will be moving to oklahoma city oklahoma where i will be assuming the position of senior pastor at bridgeway church my first official sunday there will be september 14 and we will move as soon as our home in kansas city is sold
5796814 we are hugely disappointed that the match will be played at a neutral venue
5796815 it was a crucial qualifier because it will be our first and we worked very hard at the fixtures meeting
5796816 but we have a bigger situation at home and it wont matter where we play the players will use this as a bigger motivation against ireland to get a result
5796817 this looks good on a resume plus i get to do things i like
5796818 radicals feel that because theyre waging holy war theres actually something sanctified in killing foreign infidels and people they consider bad muslims during islamic holidays
5796819 and since everyone who is not with them is an infidel or bad muslim to the extremists mind they see a perverse religious and terror logic to inflict as much death and injury as possible during ramadan
5796820 they killed innocent defenceless civilians people are traumatised we need food medicines we want the soldiers here
5796821 i compare this the talks to a shattered glass it would be very difficult to put the pieces together
5796822 were not going to walk away just because there have been a few bad days
5796823 we have already freed the towns we are on pursuit operations we will not stop until we catch up with them
5796824 concerns have been expressed that the humanitarian situation seems to be deteriorating
5796825 will defend them at all costs against any move by any group that will disrupt our aspirations for a genuine and lasting peace
5796826 this is a consequence of the non movement of the peace process
5796827 if pakistan is using radicalism as a tool of policy for strategic depth in afghanistan well i wish to tell them that it wont work
5796828 he has the right intentions i hope he gets the tools of control that is for the pakistani government to decide and that is for us and the international community to help him with
5796829 afghanistan cannot achieve peace or prosperity without friendly relations with pakistan i hope he recognizes that what they are doing in terms of supporting militancy in afghanistan is causing immense damage to pakistan itself someone has to recognize this need for change and for a modern relationship with afghanistan a civilized relationship i hope it will occur
5796830 the president can go everywhere and we are not afraid of anything this icc is ridiculous
5796831 we will not show any respect to it we will just ignore it and disregard it
5796832 that the suffering in darfur must definitely stop that human rights must be respected and that the sudanese government should make great efforts to that end
5796833 avoidance of the abuse of the principle of universal jurisdiction
5796834 we have very strong support from african countries for our candidacy
5796835 i think its a hard sell and i dont see much upside to tom ridge except for john mccain likes him a lot
5796836 i dont think hes going to be a big benefit in pennsylvania and even if he is i think the downside is the rest of the country among conservatives are going to be upset about this just at the moment theyre beginning to work up being excited about john mccain
5796837 if mccain picks a pro abortionist he will forfeit his moral authority and political advantage on the issue and might very well be conceding the election to obama
5796838 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever decision john makes
5796839 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5796840 you dont pass that sort of legislation unless theres some sort of intent to use it
5796841 were certainly poised and ready when market conditions are appropriate

5796843 i am not sure you could sum up u s pakistan policy as a complete success or complete failure its somewhere in between

5796845 to look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing one does not see anything until one sees its beauty then and then only does it come into existence
5796846 but rather of possessing articles intending they should be used in some way at some future time of preparing and instigating acts of terrorism the precise details of which such as time and place had yet to be finalized
5796847 is amongst the largest and most extensive ever discovered and thus makes this case one of the most serious of its type to come before the courts
5796848 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
5796849 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
5796850 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
5796851 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
5796852 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
5796853 should we forget that a mac is far more expensive than comparably equipped windows based machines even though it offers little in the way of tangible benefits

5796863 please dont focus on one particular topic this year we have great potential here for tourism and the forum must also focus on sustainable economies
5796864 i guess im just a little surprised that people dont understand how easy i think it is for a young person such as myself to see a negative situation as positive
5796865 i mean i dont know if i see it as positive but im not complaining about it

5796875 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
5796876 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
5796877 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
5796878 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
5796879 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
5796880 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
5796881 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
5796882 at intel we see netbooks and nettops as an opportunity to expand basic internet usage throughout the world through simple and affordable devices for consumers

5796887 i want to talk to foreign secretary david miliband about zimbabwe
5796888 its a condition of hosting an icc event that all member teams can play
5796889 we the icc havent yet had to deal with a situation whereby a country isnt allowed by the host nations government to take part in an icc event
5796890 if that happens the board would have to meet and take whatever action it deems necessary
5796891 das ist ein gro er moment f r uns den wir erstmal genie en werden
5796892 das ist ein starker gegner doch wenn wir gold gewinnen wollen und das wollen wir m ssen wir sie schlagen
5796893 dieses spiel ist nur ein weiterer schritt in richtung gold
5796894 its a condition of hosting an icc event that all member teams can play
5796895 we the icc havent yet had to deal with a situation whereby a country isnt allowed by the host nations government to take part in an icc event
5796896 if that happens the board would have to meet and take whatever action it deems necessary
5796897 however at the moment all we have are media reports so i would say that all this remains speculative the board next meets in march so to suggest what action might be taken would be premature
5796898 a decision will have to be made about this at some point but we are not at that point at the moment
5796899 these are the normal and regular conversations which take place between the boards in international cricket
5796900 the summer of 2009 is exciting for the ecb but it also has some logistical issues which need to be resolved
5796901 we are a member of the icc are hosting the tournament and its been on the schedule for many many months
5796902 it would be safe to assume that the fact that we bid for the tournament which is an icc event means we will abide by any protocols set by the icc
5796903 zc has an obligation to fulfil its obligations under the future tours programme
5796904 ich sah den hass in den augen da wusste ich jetzt passiert etwas schlimmes
5796905 he struggled to bowl four to five over spells and he had some fitness issues as well
5796906 he should have contacted us and started working on his match fitness we dont know anything about his fitness as yet
5796907 ever since the indian series concluded he has not contacted us at all we dont even know if he has returned from india
5796908 the players not given central contracts have been given special retainers and if they show commitment and form they can come back into the team after a year
5796909 we want it to be an elite contract so players fight and compete to get it it should also serve as an incentive for younger players
5796910 were excited to be a part of the year of the sun family again theyve grown in leaps and bounds since we first signed dear black diary to the label a few years back
5796911 when glasgow grin was created it was our goal to avoid all of the mistakes that we made while in dear black diary essentially dbd was a huge learning experience that allowed us to mature and grow glasgow grin is a fresh start for us and with our debut full length we feel weve put together an extremely focused project that we feel reflects our growth as musicians it was very important to us that we come out of our corner swinging this round and saints of the greatest sin packs a powerful punch
5796912 this time around we decided to create an experience that combines music writing and artwork into one cohesive tapestry and the result is something that we are proud to share with everyone themes throughout the album vary from justifiable homicide to religion and the album is based around the story of a young man on a murder spree fueled by his faith in god
5796913 the relationship that the main character shares with god is meant to display how confusion in ideology can create hypocrisy embracing the lord on one hand and breaking commandments on the other
5796914 we just got home from our devildriver and ozzfest 2008 run of shows and i gotta say it was a fantastic experience devildriver are like family to us and it was so much fun to spend a week with them playing shows leading up to ozzfest all the shows were packed with devildriver and in this moment fans and everyone was there to have a good time we got to test out a bunch of our new songs and they went over great with the texas fans next stop dallas and ozzfest this is our second ozzfest and we are honored to be playing the main stage this year it is a surreal experience to play such a huge show the next big thing on the horizon for itm is our tour with 5fdp in october we are so stoked about this as its been months since our last real tour and we are dying to get out there and see our fans again we have a new album and this tour is the perfect way to get the ball rolling five finger death punch is kicking ass everywhere right now and we are excited to be jumping on this tour with them jeff and i used to play in a band with matt 5fdp before in this moment or 5fdp existed so it will be like hanging out with old friends its a great package and we are hitting all the major cities in the u s playing some great venues so come out and join the party
5796915 the many worlds of jonas moore is an exciting digital graphic novel thats creating quite a sensation abroad
5796916 we see this as a great concept that will make an exciting series for worldwide audiences
5796917 mgm is a great place for the many worlds of jonas moore
5796918 there has never been a black british action hero before and what appealed to me was that mgm understood this from the outset jonas moore is sophisticated educated tough and uber cool he represents the next generation of intelligent action heroes of international sci fi drama
5796919 the clinical trials show that statins are definitely an indicated therapy for people with cardiovascular disease
5796920 this is about trying to educate the public about that but also making sure the public and the physicians who tend to be very focused on ldl cholesterol management also improve hdl cholesterol and triglyceride levels among their patient population
5796921 frequently what a physician will do because its simplest and takes the least amount of time is put the patient on a statin but a statin has relatively little effect on hdl cholesterol and triglycerides
5796922 patients need to be better advised and given the necessary support whether it is dietary counseling or counseling from an exercise physiologist to achieve their ideal body weight doing that is one of the single most important ways to achieve improved hdl cholesterol and triglyceride levels

5796964 the forecast calls for it fay to move very slowly possibly into the atlantic again it could strengthen again and come back at florida and maybe even make it into the gulf of mexico
5796965 there are some computer models that call for that so weve got many many many days to watch this
5796966 we do have some bands feeding into the storm from the south
5796967 it will be these bands rotating into the storm and breaking off that could impact the bay area
5796968 we could see some tropical storm conditions from these bands
5796969 the way things are going today you have to watch every penny you spend actually
5796970 i always get the kitchen trash bags that are publix brand and we also get the water the publix brand
5796971 the oil that i bought today was like 60 80 to even a dollar cheaper

5796973 this chest expander is perfect for quick at home or office workouts
5796974 investors have been trying to put the housing and credit crisis behind them
5796975 but every time news like this comes up they have to readjust their thinking
5796976 the oil price is very important and is indeed part of the reason why weve seen investor sentiment look a bit stronger over the course of the last few weeks
5796977 short term it is still a pretty negative picture of slowing economic growth which continues to be a factor
5796978 you have stocks selling off and concerns continuing about the health of financial companies and this stokes the flight to quality bid for treasuries
5796979 the dollar is in a consolidative mode and with commodities up investors have taken that as an excuse to take the dollar lower
5796980 estamos examinando o que ocorre no mundo n o tomamos nenhuma decis o sobre o brasil quase todos os pa ses criaram um fundo soberano em que todos os lucros do petr leo s o enviados a esse fundo de pens o o pa s passa a atuar sem d ficit com o seu fundo soberano aplicado no exterior
5796981 scale their businesses and become competitive with coal oil and natural gas
5796982 comparable in price to that generated at todays power plants
5796983 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5796984 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5796985 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5796986 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5796987 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5796988 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5796989 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5796990 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5796991 ona je uvijek uz mene pa je tako bilo i prije natjecanja nisam praznovjeran niti vjerujem u nadprirodne mo i ali nadam se da me sada mo e vidjeti

5796994 make the listener change the channel to find something that actually sounds good
5796995 i think its a hard sell and i dont see much upside to tom ridge except for john mccain likes him a lot
5796996 i dont think hes going to be a big benefit in pennsylvania and even if he is i think the downside is the rest of the country among conservatives are going to be upset about this just at the moment theyre beginning to work up being excited about john mccain
5796997 if mccain picks a pro abortionist he will forfeit his moral authority and political advantage on the issue and might very well be conceding the election to obama
5796998 quite the opposite they are spreading out to other regions
5796999 there can be no question of anything other than the accord thats been signed
5797000 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this
5797001 if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5797002 i can say for certain when the new year will come but i cannot give an exact date for the withdrawal of our troops from the conflict area yet
5797003 i can only say that we will not be leaving as fast as we came
5797004 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5797005 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5797006 i appeal to you after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5797007 there are political freaks who are ready to kill innocent people for their political reasons
5797008 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5797009 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide
5797010 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5797011 they should continue to stay calm and be smart and make sure they exercise common sense
5797012 a robust indian economy and the global ambitions of successful indian corporations spurred an increase in indian outbound investment over the past several years
5797013 indian companies are particularly interested in the united states due to its business climate and its large market in addition indian companies see the united states as a source of innovation and expertise

5797029 the fbi needs to explain why it zeroed in on ivins how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media and how he or anyone else could have pulled off the attacks acting alone
5797030 obviously looking at it in hindsight we would do things differently today
5797031 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps those are the lessons learned
5797032 in hindsight it would have been useful to have saved it
5797033 the anthrax probe helped to found the field of bioforensics
5797034 at present one man is confirmed dead at the scene and another two people have been seriously injured
5797035 a further 44 walking wounded patients have been taken to the medical centre at alton towers and are being treated by medical staff and doctors
5797036 it feels great my body does not feel the same on the ground it will be great to get home
5797037 devising a route is the first issue as are altitude and range
5797038 the air cools as you climb and in northern climates the freezing point is reached sooner we also had no anti icing capability

5797046 we may be as challenged as we have been since the great depression
5797047 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5797048 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level
5797049 but i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia
5797050 certainly there will be a lot of changes in our cooperation with nato and we will have changes in the volume the quality and the timeframe in our consultations and meetings
5797051 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia
5797052 the united states got precisely what we sought in this statement
5797053 its not every day that a sovereign country is invaded and wrecked the events of the last few weeks should make us all realize that russia means business
5797054 i think the next step after the withdrawal of the russian forces is effective international engagement which completely substitutes any russian presence on the soil of georgia
5797055 im glad i was born in new jersey i always said it was the best state in the union

5797083 the iphone has changed the mobile paradigm in a short amount of time from being a phone to becoming a mobile internet device we saw the demands from business subscribers seeking out faster access speeds to broadband services especially in europe where 3g is well entrenched we also saw that the support of business class messaging was something to be desired in the first generation iphone now apple has delivered a solid platform that network operators can leverage for new business subscriber revenue potential providers are now able to offer a complete saas unified communications service bridging the iphone to the desktop experience

5797095 the advantage of egs is that you essentially only target heat rather than other specific geologic conditions
5797096 everywhere on earth the deeper you go the hotter it gets so there is heat everywhere
5797097 initially egs will be located in areas which have the most geothermally rich resource so the highest temperature closest to the surface
5797098 but as the technology improves and as the ability to produce power improves from lower temperatures then its reach is truly almost anywhere

5797197 if mccain picks a pro abortionist he will forfeit his moral authority and political advantage on the issue and might very well be conceding the election to obama
5797198 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever decision john makes

5797268 vitamin d also helps maintain bone health by keeping bone cells active

5797270 they need to ask their doctor for the right test
5797271 women should strive to keep your vitamin d levels above 125 nanomoles per liter year round to do that they are going to require supplements

5797277 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5797278 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
5797279 the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful
5797280 our group has been working on understanding heparin biosynthesis for almost 30 years
5797281 we are working on what might be the next generation of heparin production with no animal source
5797282 we treat it to reduce the molecular size then subject it to enzymatic steps to convert it to heparin
5797283 we use recombinant enzymes that are part of the natural pathway for heparin synthesis
5797284 we are now working with one liter amounts there are million liter fermenters we have to scale up three orders of magnitude which is pretty daunting but not impossible
5797285 we have talked to a number of them they all are interested in the approach but want to wait
5797286 but those drugs are a thousand times more expensive than heparin also they are not as good as heparin it has multiple activities many of which benefit patients those drugs are very specific they work well only for a small number of applications
5797287 we believe that the heparin market is here to stay
5797288 it is important that people with epilepsy and their caregivers take steps to prevent these tragedies
5797289 people with active epilepsy should shower instead of bathe take medication regularly to control seizures and should have direct supervision when
5797290 im not sure i would call it a bias because that word has negative connotations but in general people do seem to have unconscious blind spots when it comes to the elderly
5797291 so not only ems staff but also those receiving patients at trauma centers are operating on subjective assumptions as to what elderly patients need how aggressively they should be treated and what hospitals can do for them rather than on clear and standard protocol codes and trauma recommendations
5797292 and as a result as patients get older they are less likely to get into a trauma center
5797293 so the hope now is to identify this blind spot problem so that we can maybe help ems staff try to catch on and adjust their thinking and attitudes and in turn change their behavior
5797294 i think in general that most providers tend to worry more about the elderly and recognize that they are more at risk and want to get them better care
5797295 and i have to say that ive certainly never seen any evidence of an elderly bias in my practice before here in boston or elsewhere so it makes me wonder if there are other factors at play that the research didnt get at
5797296 for example older people often have complex medical problems and very strong relationships with doctors at a particular center
5797297 so ems providers might perfectly well decide to take an older patient to where they are best known or even respond to a patient request to do so whether or not that center is a trauma center
5797298 highly unlikely that these patient would have been able or have the time to express any preference of care
5797299 and there might be a subset of patients that do better elsewhere
5797300 so in my opinion what the study primarily tells us is that further research is needed
5797301 most people have a notion that elderly people have very weak immunity or they have lost immunity
5797302 this study shows that extremely elderly people have retained memory of being infected with the 1918 flu even 90 years later
5797303 its important to know that you can develop immunity to such a pandemic virus that has implications for new pandemic viruses
5797304 the elderly might be a very good donor source for finding antibodies against viruses
5797305 this study shows that humans can develop very potent immune responses against dangerous influenza that cause pandemics
5797306 it gives us hope that we can develop vaccines and antibody treatments for any other pandemic viruses that come along
5797307 the implication of this study is the 1918 virus was so powerful that the immunity you had to have in order to survive was so prominent that it lasted for the rest of your life
5797308 so those in certain age groups who had seen a related virus had the strongest responses
5797309 either they died or they developed a profound immune response
5797310 very rare case reports of pancreatitis with complications or with a fatal outcome
5797311 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
5797312 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
5797313 probably have stronger personalities and are less likely to give into temptation
5797314 we are hoping to delay or prevent those complications which would basically keep those patients off
5797315 we suggest that pancreatitis be considered in cases of abdominal pain following hpv vaccination
5797316 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
5797317 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
5797318 randomized blinded placebo controlled clinical trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5797319 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data
5797320 readily available marketing tips and tutorials accessible on the internet and other public forums tend to be outdated or incorrect while the techniques that really deliver results are kept close to the chest of those in the dominating minority
5797321 this doesnt have to be the case and the book provides the majority of search marketers with the tools and insights they need to improve their performance and level the playing field
5797322 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages otherwise theyre all toast
5797323 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
5797324 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5797325 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5797326 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5797327 in adults there has been evidence that less than six hours of sleep a night was associated with levels
5797328 that was one of the more unique findings that poor sleep quality is associated with high blood pressure
5797329 to see how their blood pressure is developing over time
5797330 it does point to the direction that the next studies need to go to understand what less sleep and less efficient sleep mean in terms of blood pressure
5797331 but the changes in the diurnal patterns for adolescents make it harder for them to get up in the morning and to get to sleep at night if we reorganize the day night schedule for adolescents that could make life easier for them and their parents
5797332 we do know that in adults poor sleep and a diminished amount of sleep are associated with obesity and hormone intolerance
5797333 changes occur in the sympathetic nervous system also fragmentary sleep activates inflammatory pathways
5797334 optimizing sleep hygiene following regular sleep habits turning the light off approximately the same time every night keeping the bedroom quieter and avoiding substances that may disturb sleep such as
5797335 kids as well as adults need to be allowed to sleep enough
5797336 we say eight hours of sleep a night but it takes an hour to wind down its very very hard to allow enough time to sleep
5797337 i think the intimates market is just taking advantage of the sliver of time they have in between the summer dress season and fall
5797338 with the end of summer and back to school they realize people are in the headset where they want to refresh everything in their wardrobe even the stuff you cant see
5797339 haywood was allowed to go by immigration officials at indira gandhi international airport
5797340 he was not an accused his passport could not have been seized a lookout notice was issued delhi immigration was specifically told immigration does not work under us concerned authorities will hold enquiries
5797341 girls i have to tell you something auntie j is going to have a baby its a boy the baby is in her belly right now
5797342 like your baby mommy but you have a girl in your belly
5797343 no honey mommy doesnt have a baby in my belly anymore she died
5797344 my doctor has advised me not to travel in the short term and so regretfully i am unable to attend what will surely be an historic convention in denver
5797345 i was very much looking forward to chairing the california delegation and i offer my best wishes to californias delegates in this vital nomination process
5797346 i call on the name of the lord oh lord save me
5797347 even though i walk through the valley of shadow of death i fear no evil for you are with me
5797348 his lamp shines upon my head and by his light i walk through darkness
5797349 there was much talk in town about your desperate journey for that is what they call your pilgrimage but i believed and destroy our city therefore i made my escape
5797350 he is seven times worse off than if he had never gone to the slough of despond people mock and despise him as a turncoat
5797351 he crosses the street to avoid me he is ashamed of what he did
5797352 a dog returns to its vomit but let us leave him what have you met on the way
5797353 i was sorely tempted by a woman named wanton at the wicket gate but i went my way then at the foot of the hill of difficulty i met an old man named adams the first he offered me his three daughters lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and pride of life and i was inclined to go until i saw written on his forehead put off the old man with his deeds and it came burning into my mind that he was going to make me a slave so when i refused and pulled away he pinched me so hard i thought he had a piece of my flesh when i go halfway up the hill a man overtook me and beat me until i thought i was dead he said he served adams the first
5797354 he does not know how to show mercy to those who bread the law
5797355 yes he would doubtless have killed me if someone had not stopped him
5797356 i met discontent he told me they valley was without honor and if i were t wade through this valley i would offend all our friends pride arrogance self conceit and worldly glory i told him they were indeed relatives of mine for they are according to the flesh but since i became a pilgrim they disowned me and i reject them
5797357 shame he said religion is a pitiful thing conscience is unmanly few of the mighty rich and wise were ever of my opinion it is shameful to repent after a sermon it is shameful to ask forgiveness for a petty fault religion alienates a man from the great
5797358 no one i had sunshine all the rest of the way through the valley of humiliation and also through the valley of the shadow of death
5797359 may we have your good company we will talk of things that are profitable
5797360 what is so profitable as to talk of things of god and if a man loves to talk of miracles wonder or signs where shall he find thins so sweetly penned as in the holy scripture
5797361 indeed few understand the necessity of a work of grace in their soul in order to gain eternal life but live ignorantly in the works of the law by which no man can obtain the kingdom of heaven
5797362 heavenly knowledge such as this is the gift of god
5797363 he is the son of say well his name is talkative he adapts to any company he talks as well in a tavern he has no religion in his heart or his home they are as empty of religion as the white of an egg is of flavor religion is only on his tongue
5797364 remember the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk but of power talkative is the shame of religion he has caused many men to stumble and fall
5797365 i am not fond of him now i know how to be rid of him
5797366 how does the saving grace of god manifest itself when it is in the heart of a man
5797367 i think it shows itself by inclining the soul to abhor its sin
5797368 why whats the difference between crying out against sin and abhorring sin
5797369 oh a great deal a man may cry out because of a law against it but he cannot abhor is unless he has a godly antipathy against it what was your second point
5797370 that is also false if a man can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge but had not love he is nothing
5797371 you are not my judge you are not fit to be talked to gook bye
5797372 it may happen that he will think of it again
5797373 o jornalismo muito mais organizado que a publicidade dever amos nos unir e fazer o mesmo
5797374 go to the ant you sluggard consider its ways and be wise
5797375 the farther we go the more danger we meet with
5797376 if we came within their reach they would rip us to pieces
5797377 but going back to my own country is sure death going ahead is fear of death and beyond it everlasting life
5797378 this palace beautiful was built by the lord of the hill for the relief and security of pilgrims
5797379 i will call out one of the virgins if she likes your talk she will take you in to the rest of the family
5797380 yes but greatly against my will my carnal impulses are now my grief
5797381 what is it that makes you desire to go to the celestial city
5797382 why i hope to see him alive who did hang dead from the cross
5797383 conquered kingdoms administered justice and gained what promised who shut the mouths of loins quenched the fury of the flames and escaped the edge of the sword whose weakness was turned to strength and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies
5797384 it appears to be as dangerous going down as it was coming up
5797385 it is hard for a man to go down into the valley of humiliation without tripping
5797386 where do you come from and where are you going demanded the monster
5797387 i come from the city of destruction which is a place of evil
5797388 by this i perceive you are one of my subjects for all that evil country is min i am apollyon
5797389 i was born in your dominions but your service was hard for the wages of sin is death so i want to heal myself i am going to the celestial city
5797390 no prince will so lightly lose his subject go back to the city of destruction
5797391 i have given my self to the king of princes
5797392 it is very common for those who have professed themselves his servants to return to me
5797393 do you not know how many of his servants have been put to shameful deaths
5797394 you have already been unfaithful to him you almost choked in the slough of despond
5797395 all that is true and much more but the prince i serve is merciful
5797396 the kind of alienated outsider book they just dont write anymore
5797397 i have to call you back in a minute i have to make the appointment for the tubal
5797398 no really when did i have the baby whats the babys birthday
5797399 he was going to project a message that said free tibet and some other messages that would have been three stories high in different locations in beijing
5797400 well you already have children so its not like you should feel pressured youre pretty busy as it is
5797401 mom can i go to noras house after school tomorrow
5797402 i am about ready to be on an island we are going back into the smallville mythology a little bit and kind of explore how oliver became the green arrow why he is the green arrow and how he became so good at archery and all that stuff
5797403 i wish i would have had a bit more notice but well see what we can do by tomorrow at five oclock in the morning
5797404 but i think once you do that just like in everything once you question something and your hearts not in it it becomes really dangerous to keep doing it because you are vulnerable youre susceptible just like you hear these football players say if your not playing 100 you are going to get hurt so theres that and as he starts to kind of question whether or not its worth it anymore
5797405 clark is starting to embrace his destiny a little bit more so you see that happening
5797406 its interesting because the guy thats worn the suit is going the other way and the guy who has never put the suit on is going the other way so we start to butt heads a little bit so its going to be fun
5797407 i had just shot a pilot with cassidy freeman who plays tess mercer on smallville she ruined it
5797408 they didnt pick it up and i think it was a day or two later when i got the call and we talked a lot about it i love playing the character its a great show and a lot of fun for me so when they said series regular i was definitely interested im excited about it
5797409 i got a lot of faith in them in the writers
5797410 they always write good stuff for me i am just lucky because i get to be the face that benefits theyre the ones that do it though

5797434 i think its important we dont pursue a policy of trying to isolate russia
5797435 the georgian air force and artillery struck the sleeping town at midnight more than 1 500 civilians perished in the first hours of the shelling at the same time georgian special forces shot 10 russian peacekeepers who didnt expect such a betrayal from their georgian colleagues
5797436 does that mean that the us and nato can use brute force when they want to his parallel incidentally and russia has to abstain from it even if it has to look at thousands of its own citizens being shot
5797437 mr dion has indicated that the government should be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he hasnt got good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position
5797438 polls do indicate that the next election is in all likelihood a minority one way or the other
5797439 the fact of the matter is what i will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament or whether in fact the government a government needs a new mandate
5797440 they have no intention of respecting the fixed election date
5797441 so i think obviously were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding
5797442 have to make a judgment in the next little while
5797443 you have a man who is not respecting parliament and he will not respect his own law
5797444 he was a wonderful person and a good friend of mine
5797445 his death was a surprise to me as i was unaware of his illness my condolences to his family he will be missed
5797446 i am extremely proud of the example he set in his music the spinners music was clean
5797447 what comforts me is he is one person who lived his life exactly the way he wanted to

5797458 the future is about having a platform in the cloud
5797459 over the next decade you are going to see an incredible transformation in my opinion
5797460 it doesnt really make sense for most companies to have their own data centers just as it doesnt make sense for most companies to produce their own electric power
5797461 the eucalyptus team has combined several useful open source technologies including mule vde and libvirt into a compelling service layer
5797462 work still remains to incorporate richer networking storage and security capabilities but we look forward to contributing further to building an open cloud ecosystem

5797496 what i really need to do is get some lard off my ass
5797497 lets face it thats the real issue i didnt have this problem until i got fat i always had perfect blood pressure i know that once i go back on atkins itll all go back to normal
5797498 well i know i have to lose weight so im sure ill get my shit together and do it sooner rather than later
5797499 if you want i could write you a prescription to help you lose weight
5797500 i have patients that have had very good success with it even losing ten percent of your weight would help your blood pressure a lot
5797501 thanks doc but i know if i put my mind to it ill get the job done naturally
5797502 at kode5 vs mtw we played well but didnt manage to keep it up through the last map and id give credit to mtw for not letting us do that
5797503 at extreme masters the mouz players said that if they had lost to you after the close game sk would have won the championship at kode5 mtw said exactly the same thing whats missing
5797504 id say we have a team with huge potential and a great mix of players but were not using it as well as we could
5797505 is this why you beat fnatic quite regularly but tend to lose when it counts more

5797521 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
5797522 given that a lot of people work for insurance companies a lot of people work for hmos youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
5797523 they need relief now so my attitude is lets build up the system we got lets make it more efficient we may be over time as we make the system more efficient and everybodys covered decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively

5797558 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities

5797560 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5797561 and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5797562 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that
5797563 i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5797564 proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional us1 billion 1 15 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5797565 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5797566 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience versus barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics

5797658 but i guess once you injure your take off ankle you really dont have anything to do
5797659 no this is the first time that i hurt it its not a strain or twist but i hurt the joint and just could not take off and it only aggravated when the qualifying round started i could neither run nor take off gt
5797660 probably it was not great but then i did not go full throttle all i wanted to do was to peak at the right time and give my best where it matters most unfortunately my ankle held me back

5797689 gue putus dari donita dari pihak kita berdua memang kita lagi ada masalah
5797690 for a number of reasons foremost being his gradually weakening legitimacy at the head of the political order
5797691 set aside the rose tinted spectacles he has been wearing now for years also led to his difficulties in accepting opposition or obstacles in his power
5797692 politicians who have dealt with musharraf both those who form a part of the present government and those with a role at the national level in previous times speak of the former army chiefs condescending and sometimes derisive style in dealing with those who dared to differ
5797693 the gradual eviction of such persons from the corridors of power may well have contributed to musharrafs growing megalomania
5797694 was no surprise to see him mr musharraf take credit for incorporating what he called the essence of democracy into the system
5797695 but he must be economising on truth when he claimed that he had always decided important matters by taking all stakeholders on board
5797696 there would be few takers for his view since the nation had hardly seen him consulting the pm or his cabinet
5797697 lot to be satisfied and happy as he played a crucial innings in the chequered history of the country
5797698 he steered the country out of successive crises successfully and musharraf shaukat aziz duo brought the economy on rail because of a number of prudent policy measures
5797699 one of the darkest periods in the countrys history has come to an end
5797700 riding on the coat tails of the us he ruled the country through the fa ade of a democracy he invented to dupe his foreign allies into lapping up his despotism hook line and sinker
5797701 playing upon the post 9 11 insecurity of the us and the world at large he used the war against terrorism as a device to mutilate everything remotely resembling constitutionalism
5797702 the field is open for the politicians to address the most pressing problems facing the nation
5797703 determining what the priorities ought to be is not difficult militancy the economy and relations with india and afghanistan need to be addressed urgently
5797704 indeed the nature of the problems is such that they may get worse before they get better but at the very least the politicians must show the same purpose and focus in dealing with these problems that they have demonstrated in taking on the president
5797705 even though it is beset with its own problems at the moment it is in indias interest to lend a helping hand in this process of getting pakistan back on its feet
5797706 cannot overlook the contribution general musharraf made towards stabilising and improving the relationship between india and pakistan learning perhaps from the kargil misadventure
5797707 his most lasting contribution may well be the process of india pakistan detente which needs to be taken forward resolutely
5797708 sceptics would wonder whether musharrafs ouster was part of a deal between the government and the army to maintain the latters primacy on key national security issues
5797709 if that turns out to be true ties with pakistan might get a lot worse before they can get better
5797710 opportune moment for pakistan to set its house in order
5797711 we are hugely disappointed that the match will be played at a neutral venue
5797712 it was a crucial qualifier because it will be our first and we worked very hard at the fixtures meeting
5797713 but we have a bigger situation at home and it wont matter where we play the players will use this as a bigger motivation against ireland to get a result

5797740 this time around we decided to create an experience that combines music writing and artwork into one cohesive tapestry and the result is something that we are proud to share with everyone themes throughout the album vary from justifiable homicide to religion and the album is based around the story of a young man on a murder spree fueled by his faith in god
5797741 the guy who interviews me is going to be a 35 year old kid in a torn t shirt and blue jeans
5797742 look at the guy in the ad hes got a real thin beard
5797743 police state 2 0 is really about upgrading the surveillance system with the help as you said earlier of u s companies like cisco general electric who have been providing these technologies
5797744 oh you cant take my picture when im picking my teeth its not fair
5797745 education is learning what you didnt even know you didnt know
5797746 i am pleased with the work of the fmfada over the past 18 months to create a plan for fort monroe that ensures this spectacular and historic property will be enjoyed by many generations to come
5797747 i also am pleased that the process to create the reuse plan has included many community and regional leaders experts in historic preservation and economic development the city of hampton and the national park service
5797748 i have a baby at my house gran i do my baby is callie

5797763 dear user of member fsf org administration of member fsf org would like to inform you we have received reports that your e mail account has been used to send a large amount of spam during the recent week most likely your computer had been compromised and now contains a trojaned proxy server please follow our instruction in the attached text file in order to keep your computer safe sincerely yours member fsf org technical support team
5797764 there are some who say that a collaborative development model taking advantage of these freedoms tends to make software that is technically better they may be right and it would be nice if freedom brings such a practical bonus however the freedom itself is more important than the bonus so the free software movement focuses on the freedom
5797765 the fsf has been talking with eben moglen for some time planning how we will work with the sflc we expect to work closely with the sflc which will lend its legal resources to the free software foundation and to other free software developers
5797766 i am very excited by this opportunity to work closely with fsf president richard stallman though i am sad to see bradley leave the organization following such a successful tenure the fsf faces an exciting year ahead as well as tough challenges the additional legal resources being offered by the software freedom law center will give us an opportunity to expand on our gpl compliance efforts we expect to work closely with the law center and the free software community as we work towards gpl version 3 were also moving in two senses as we have just launched our new home page at www fsf org and well be moving to new office premises in may so expect an updated gpl version 2 with that new address
5797767 everyday it becomes more apparent that the growing success of free software threatens established proprietary software and media interests these interests will continue to see our freedoms as threats and we fully expect and are preparing for further challenges to our community
5797768 i therefore urge the boston public library to terminate its association with overdrive audio books and adopt a policy of refusing to be agents for the propagation of digital restrictions management
5797769 gnu general public license version 2 june 1991 copyright c 1989 1991 free software foundation inc 59 temple place suite 330 boston ma 02111 1307 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed
5797770 the collaborative free software approach is the one that is most sustainable in the long term
5797771 we believe that the free software approach is the one that is best for uwc it is our intention to produce a system that is usable by other african higher education institutions some of which will eventually join with us in creating the generic components of the system the collaborative free software approach is the approach that is most sustainable in the long term
5797772 the days of secret in house developed management software are gone and the free software open source approach is a viable alternative to implementing proprietary software for this purpose
5797773 we will use this framework for all our software development at uwc so that we create integrated tools instead of isolated islands of proprietary software
5797774 i dont think everyone will have the expectation that it will achieve those kind of levels because the market is very different now
5797775 its a pretty short timeframe so im not expecting it to have a big impact but theyre trying like everyone else to clear the 08s off the lot
5797776 but also because of higher gas prices and because the labor market is not as strong as it was 3 years ago theres not a lot of dry powder left
5797777 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women
5797778 anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people
5797779 this court is allowing two lesbians to force these individuals to choose between being doctors in the state of california or being able to practice their faith
5797780 furthers californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
5797781 european legislators who endorse software patents frequently claim that those wouldnt affect free software or
5797782 with the release of gplv3 we aim to increase the international reach of the free software movement
5797783 we are working closely with our sister organisation and the sflc to make sure gplv3 will address the overarching and national european issues
5797784 europe has a vibrant ecosystem of highly skilled free software developers and small and medium sized free software enterprises it will be our goal to strengthen this development and help european governments to build upon it
5797785 nlnets support of the gpl and the free software movement and its desire to see the successful adoption of gplv3 achieved in the spirit of internationalization made the funding of this project an important priority for us
5797786 we hope to encourage other grant making organisations to help fund this unique project
5797787 the guiding principle for developing the gpl is to defend the freedom of all users
5797788 as we address the issues raised by the community we will do so in terms of the four basic freedoms software users are entitled to to study copy modify and redistribute the software they use gplv3 will be designed to protect those freedoms under current technical and social conditions and will address new forms of use and current global requirements for commercial and non commercial users
5797789 it is an exciting time in the history of software particularly in the history of the free software movement
5797790 through this process all voices will be heard we will evaluate every opinion and will consider all arguments in light of the gpls goals the process is accessible transparent and public for all those who want to participate
5797791 the general public license is a groundbreaking legal document that has been the cornerstone of the free software movement and has created extraordinary amounts of change in the industry
5797792 it is time though to analyze and address the legal and business issues that are raised by the use of free software across the globe and the valuable and critical business transactions that routinely transpire under the gpl
5797793 as a leading supporter of free and open source software and the community and a big proponent of the gpl and of license reform hp is pleased to see that the free software foundation has developed an inclusive and transparent process for updating the gpl a process that should increase confidence in the gpl and further enhance cooperative development activities
5797794 participating in the development and distribution of free and open source software is something hp focuses on every day and we look forward to what the community will accomplish with gplv3
5797795 the market has validated the free software model laid out in the gpl as a powerful choice for developing enterprise software
5797796 novell is a strong supporter of the gpl and has contributed millions of lines of code under the gpl we applaud richard stallman and the free software foundation for involving the free software community in creating the next version of the gpl novell looks forward to actively participating in that process
5797797 this is an extremely important event that will have a huge impact on the future of free software and im delighted that the fsf has chosen to follow such an open process and consult so widely
5797798 because this process is both inclusive and public the fsf is ensuring that the views of everyone with an interest in the future of the gpl can participate in defining the next generation of the license
5797799 the enormous contribution of richard stallman and the free software foundation to software development innovation and freedom is beyond question
5797800 we welcome the fsfs announcement of efforts to improve the gpl through an open inclusive and international public process committed to the software freedoms that have made the gpl successful
5797801 because he runs on a nosoftwarepatents ticket and that is the message we want to reinforce
5797802 to our entire community and especially to the foundation for a free information infrastructure ffii
5797803 threaten us all because they dont discriminate based on programming language operating system or licensing model
5797804 this is a campaign for a cause not for a person
5797805 because he runs on a nosoftwarepatents ticket and that is the message we want to reinforce
5797806 some other nominees also stand for valid concerns and noble causes however those issues and individuals have already received a lot of coverage in the mass media while the implications of software patents to the whole world including developing countries still require much more public awareness in the sense that software patents monopolize mental steps they are also a human rights issue
5797807 indisputable e campaigning power of the anti software patent movement
5797808 to donate the microsoft sponsored prize money to the ffii
5797809 probably wouldnt have become involved let alone succeeded in this political battle
5797810 right now gnash is playing more movies than any of the other free players all actionscript classes exist and work but not all the methods of each class are fully implemented with a few more developers it could be reasonably complete in a few months
5797811 i therefore urge the boston public library to terminate its association with overdrive audio books and adopt a policy of refusing to be agents for the propagation of digital restrictions management
5797812 as we expected 2006 is proving to be a pivotal year for the free software movement with the release of the gplv3 we have brought to focus the debate on the threats posed by digital restrictions management software patents and treacherous computing our communitys efforts in the months ahead will help set the tone in the battle for computer users freedom
5797813 the gnu project achieved the bulk of its success by staying committed to a philosophical manifesto coordinating interoperability and supporting the passion of free software activists to write code now we support the passion of our people by moving the free code into all areas of government business home and personal devices
5797814 as the author of the gpl and copyright holder on the largest body of gpld covered free software the fsf hears many theories of potential legal claims and challenges to the gpl we hear the fear uncertainty and doubt fud expressed that the gpl has never been tested in court and that somehow that is a sign of its weakness nothing could be further from the truth of course put quite simply if you dont accept the terms of the gpl then you have no rights to the copyrighted works it covers what is there left to test the gpl is a software license it is not a contract it gives permissions from the copyright holder you dont want to accept those permissions end of discussion
5797815 the gpl acts as a means by which certain software may be copied modified and redistributed without violating the softwares copyright protection as such the gpl encourages rather than discourages free competition and the distribution of computer operating systems the benefits of which directly pass to consumers these benefits include lower prices better access and more innovation
5797816 let us all stop and consider the consequences of what this us federal judge has said on being presented with the facts surrounding the gpl he was able to define a range of benefits available to those that value the freedoms delivered by the gpl the question we are all left with is why would anyone put up with the inferred consequences of proprietary software
5797817 if you care about lower prices better access to software or more innovation then gpld software is for you or as the free software would describe that you value freedom
5797818 flash protests direct actions and practical ways that people can get involved and help stop the stupidity of drm
5797819 we see this as the tip of the iceberg and it is our duty to do something about it
5797820 we know about the collusion of big media device manufacturers and proprietary software companies to lock us down
5797821 their aim is to put digital restrictions management drm into all our computers and homes
5797822 in any other industry such limitations or invasions would be considered major flaws a media player that restricts what you can play is like a car that you wont let you steer
5797823 products containing drm are defective only unlike other products these defects are deliberately created by an industry that has long stopped caring about us
5797824 media bosses scream pirate equating sharing with murder and kidnap then sue our college students they then steal our rights and impose crippled products upon us
5797825 media bosses have long been the gatekeepers to the market for artists now they are threatened by new distribution methods that give artists new freedoms and direct access to an audience drm is the media bosses attempt to re impose their rule
5797826 apple once proclaimed rip mix and burn but when the majors offered them an exclusive deal to distribute their music files they quickly stepped into line and imposed drm on their customers
5797827 apple is now embarrassed by their once famous marketing slogan as they try to make excuses for these digital restrictions
5797828 by listening to people from around the world we are working toward a license that acts consistently in many different legal systems and in a variety of situations
5797829 the primary purpose of the gnu gpl is to preserve users freedom to use share and modify free software
5797830 we depend on public review to make the gpl do this job reliably
5797831 last november we published a document which outlined the process for drafting the new gpl
5797832 as of now we are still on schedule for a final release in early 2007
5797833 weve got all self serving perspectives in terms of industry groups certainly no one needs to speak for microsoft
5797834 there are the bloodstains on the wall and here it is dried on the floor
5797835 and here a womans shoes she was a victim of the militia we found her corpse in the grave
5797836 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5797837 any work of authorship meant for human appreciation rather than machine execution
5797838 eu study on the economic and technical evolution of the scientific publication markets of europe
5797839 the fsf has had a busy year revising the gnu general public license and campaigning successfully against digital restrictions management we see 2007 as a year of opportunity to significantly increase free software adoption and our annual meeting will help us develop our priorities for the year ahead
5797840 vista is an upsell masquerading as an upgrade it is an overall regression when you look at the most important aspect of owning and using a computer your control over what it does obviously ms windows is already proprietary and very restrictive and well worth rejecting but the new features in vista are a trojan horse to smuggle in even more restrictions well be focusing attention on detailing how they work how to resist them and why people should care
5797841 whilst microsoft embarks upon its largest ever product launch its marketing dollars will be spent in an effort to fool the media and user community about the goals of vista our campaign will ask the important questions can you set yourself or your company free can you ever be free from microsoft as with our campaign against digital restrictions management we aim to demonstrate that technologists can be social activists because we know the harm that vista will cause
5797842 microsoft continues to threaten the freedom of all computer users with vague claims of software patent infringement although more people than ever before in the u s have the technical capabilities to develop software the blight of patents prevents them from making useful advancements as such we need to ask what is the best way to eliminate the specter of software patents so that free software development can flourish and how do we get organized to make it happen
5797843 in the early years of the free software movement the fsf worked to solve the problem of proprietary software by funding free software development with the creation of this campaigns team we are expanding our work to help clear the way politically and publicly for free software
5797844 i am excited to be joining the staff of the free software foundation at such an exciting and important time i look forward to working with john sullivan and continuing the momentum of badvista org defectivebydesign org and community adoption of gplv3 most of all i hope to begin reaching out and working with the many communities that value and appreciate the importance of software freedom
5797845 from a philosophical perspective we wanted to create a gnu linux distribution where the user has access to all the sources for all software on the system this includes everything from the heart of the kernel through to the everyday desktop applications
5797846 with all the kernel firmware and restricted repositories removed and the reliance on ubuntus proprietary distribution management tool gone this distribution is the most advanced gnu linux distribution that has a commitment to be 100 free
5797847 i think sun has contributed more than any other company to the free software community in the form of software it shows leadership its an example i hope others will follow
5797848 your program though in itself free may be restricted by non free software that it depends on since the problem is most prominent today for java programs we call it the java trap
5797849 ogg is your safest bet to be free from patent litigation when using compressed audio this is especially true given the recent upswing in patent based lawsuits what is most frightening and underscores the landmine metaphor often used to describe software patents is the recent 1 5b preliminary judgment against microsoft microsoft thought it had a paid up nonexclusive license to practice the patents in mp3 this judgment demonstrates that there is no good way to protect yourself from these threats the only viable solution right now is to switch to ogg and work for the abolition of software patents
5797850 t he users can get sued too either as a way of attacking a developer or just as a way to squeeze money out of them on their own or to cause mayhem all software developers and users are vulnerable
5797851 for years anyone with a tv and video could record bbc programmes and keep them as long as they want now with this new service you have to own a specific brand of computer system microsoft how does that help schools and home users to move away from the microsoft monopoly it doesnt it gives them another reason to keep buying the over priced and insecure windows operating system
5797852 bbc values have been corrupted because bbc executives are too closely associated with microsoft bbc values have been corrupted because the iplayer uses proprietary software and standards made under an exclusive deal with microsoft bbc values have been corrupted because license fee payers must now own a microsoft operating system to download bbc programming bbc values have been corrupted because license fee payers must accept drm technologies that spy and monitor on the digital files held on their computers we are here today to help bbc director general mark thompson clean up this drm mess and to encourage the bbc trust to reverse course and eliminate drm from the bbc iplayer
5797853 since we founded the free software movement over 23 years ago the free software community has developed thousands of useful programs that respect the users freedom the programs are in the gnu linux operating system as well as personal computers telephones internet servers and more most of these programs use the gnu gpl to guarantee every user the freedom to run study adapt improve and redistribute the program
5797854 a necessary update to deal with the new threats to free software that have emerged since version 2 of the gpl
5797855 by hearing from so many different groups in a public drafting process we have been able to write a license that successfully addresses a broad spectrum of concerns but even more importantly these different groups have had an opportunity to find common ground on important issues facing the free software community today such as patents tivoization and treacherous computing
5797856 the gpl is the fundamental license that ties the free software community together and version 3 does an excellent job of updating the license to the present day computing reality
5797857 a lot of time and effort went into this license now free programs must adopt it so as to offer their users its stronger protection for their freedom
5797858 the gnu gpl makes sense in terms of its purpose freedom and social solidarity trying to understand it in terms of the goals and values of open source is like trying understand a cd drives retractable drawer as a cupholder you can use it for that but that is not what it was designed for
5797859 weve made a few very important improvements based on the comments weve heard most notably with license compatibility now that the license is almost finished we can look forward to distributing the gnu system under gplv3 and making its additional protections available to the whole community
5797860 the reason to migrate is because of the existing problems which gplv3 will fix such as tivoization drm and threats from software patents further advantages of gplv3 include better internationalization gentler termination support for bittorrent and compatibility with the apache license
5797861 the gnu gpl makes sense in terms of its purpose freedom and social solidarity trying to understand it in terms of the goals and values of open source is like trying understand a cd drives retractable drawer as a cupholder you can use it for that but that is not what it was designed for
5797862 with the growing utilization of free software and the rejection of microsofts vista large vendors like hp dell lenovo and sun have the opportunity and responsibility to acknowledge the market for hardware suitable for free software users hardware that meets ethical requirements for user freedom privacy and security we hope that this paper will focus attention on what needs to get done in the coming months
5797863 we aim to raise the level of awareness to the threats posed by drm technology and we are calling for political action to curb this gradual abolition of our rights
5797864 no fair use no purchase and resell no private copies no sharing no backup no swapping no mix tapes no privacy no commons no control over our computers no control over our electronic devices the conversion of our homes into apparatus to monitor our interaction with published works and web sites
5797865 if this type of invasion of privacy were coming from any other source it would not be tolerated that it is the media and technology companies leading the way does not make it benign getting big media to report on the actions of big media is one issue we face
5797866 if consumers even know theres a drm what it is and how it works weve already failed
5797867 the gpl was designed to ensure that all users of a program receive the four essential freedoms which define free software these freedoms allow you to run the program as you see fit study and adapt it for your own purposes redistribute copies to help your neighbor and release your improvements to the public the recent patent agreement between microsoft and novell aims to undermine these freedoms in this draft we have worked hard to prevent such deals from making a mockery of free software
5797868 the gnu gpl makes sense in terms of its purpose freedom and social solidarity trying to understand it in terms of the goals and values of open source is like trying understand a cd drives retractable drawer as a cupholder you can use it for that but that is not what it was designed for
5797869 microsoft has engaged in anticompetitive conduct in the software industry for many years and has sought to attack free software for almost as long
5797870 free software offers social activists an alternative to what vista represents using free software we can further social and environmental justice without supporting growth based on waste control and short term profit
5797871 i would urge social movements to develop a migration strategy including a commitment not to move to vista
5797872 dependent upon software owned and exclusively controlled by entities that design their software in ways directly opposed to grassroots social change
5797873 free software is an issue of free speech when we depend upon our computers for social activism and political campaigning freedoms that we have been defending so vigorously for so long are being handed away through the adoption of software that restricts user freedom
5797874 deltah was our second major release based on ubuntu hardy 2 0 was released on may 1st 2008 less than a week after hardys release
5797875 a free as in freedom gnu linux distribution that takes all the non free blobs out of a rather popular distribution
5797876 this is an historic opportunity to fix the us patent system as the bilski rehearing will directly address the boundaries of the subject matter of patents in our brief the end software patents project supports the supreme courts long held position that computer software should not be patentable and has highlighted to the court the real economic harm software patents cause the us economy
5797877 with the launch of the end software patents campaign we are tackling head on the major threat the free software movement faces interestingly this is a campaign that was instigated at last years meeting at the same time we see the incredible success that free software is having and how promotion and adoption can be driven by ethical concerns
5797878 wbur has a great schedule of news and information programming 24 hours a day which we are very happy to make available to ogg vorbis listeners its exciting to work with the free software foundation to give a new audience the chance to listen to wburs award winning programing as well as the wonderful programs from npr and the bbc worldservice that you can find daily on wbur
5797879 i would like to thank wbur general manager paul la camera for so graciously listening to the case we made for free audio standards the leadership displayed by wbur in providing a free audio format will help to bring this issue the national attention and recognition it deserves and will serve as a vital step in educating the public and other publicly funded radio stations we urge npr listeners to stream wburs ogg vorbis stream and to acknowledge and thank wbur for this work when making your contributions
5797880 a place where lawyers and geeks could explain things to each other and work together so theyd understand each others work better
5797881 w hen you have an idea you hope might work and then to implement it tweak it and morph it because other people show up and have ideas that are better than yours and then have people you care about and admire tell you that what you are doing matters i cant think of a more satisfying feeling
5797882 i believe the copyleft principle creates a fair equilibrium between taking existing works and giving back whatever extensions and modifications were made when i first heard of certain commercial corporations not playing by the rules by taking gpl licensed code but not releasing the source code of their derivative works i was outraged big business who usually are the first to enforce their own copyright and related rights if anyone dares to infringe them suddenly violating copyright themselves
5797883 software patents endanger both software developers and businesses ironically stifling the very innovation that the u s patent system was intended to foster
5797884 with statements from the supreme court and the uspto supporting our position we can use our court system to restore our patent system to its original state without delay
5797885 software patents are a burden on u s businesses and innovation and the debate on the patentability of software will have a profound impact on the software industry over the next 20 years
5797886 i am pleased to see that the end software patents project has formed to directly address the problem these are smart people who know a lot about patents and i have every expectation that they will help achieve change
5797887 there is one law for all patents and it is being weakened to mitigate the mess with business methods and software which means that designers of drugs machines and bona fide electronics are having the rug pulled from under them
5797888 rather than neuter the entire patent system we are proposing to return the scope of what is patentable to what it was before we started seeing all the headlines about how the patent system is broken
5797889 im not going to lie and say we didnt expect to do it
5797890 we werent going to take it for granted but it certainly was a goal to get to the medal round
5797891 this team always tries to make it a little bit too interesting
5797892 we cant just blow somebody out no it has to be close
5797893 this increased support of wireless drivers by atheros is a major step toward our vision of a laptop that runs only free software and that boots on top of a free bios
5797894 the road to hardware free from restrictions how hardware vendors can help the free software community
5797895 for many years we have been suffering from microsofts pc monopoly a platform that has allowed microsoft to inflict untold harm on computer users and the computing industry the free software community has been working for many years to give people an opportunity to escape to gnu linux from windows but the iphone would allow no such escape route
5797896 the severity of the restrictions imposed by apples iphone are contingent on the idea that you see it as just a phone but that justification is an attempt to whitewash ethical standards that have been intrinsic to general purpose computers apples new restrictive model gives them unprecedented and unjust control over iphone users we should reject the iphone and the model it represents and instead support companies that respect and encourage our freedom
5797897 i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5797898 later that day both matthew whitton and ricky dyer admitted it was a costume
5797899 was born in colon republic of panama which is outside the former us controlled canal zone and is unquestionably sovereign panamanian territory
5797900 which features two new songs lucy wrote for the opening scene and the closing scene of the movie
5797901 i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show
5797902 im happy to say that the episodes they sent to me to look at were really engaging
5797903 and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work ive been involved in
5797904 listen the thing for me to do the most important thing to remember is to not mistake my presence for the event
5797905 the event is csi the show and everyone has a responsibility to bring their unique talents and gifts to it and thats what im going to do
5797906 the artist is nothing without gift but gift is nothing without work
5797907 ive loved and been loved all the rest is background music
5797908 em seu cora o ele pode acreditar no que quiser mas no papel n o pode se converter
5797909 i dont think everyone will have the expectation that it will achieve those kind of levels because the market is very different now
5797910 its a pretty short timeframe so im not expecting it to have a big impact but theyre trying like everyone else to clear the 08s off the lot
5797911 but also because of higher gas prices and because the labor market is not as strong as it was 3 years ago theres not a lot of dry powder left
5797912 those four vehicles in specific are great high mileage vehicles
5797913 we havent seen anything like this before where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival
5797914 deserved the support of people everywhere who care for justice and freedom
5797915 and will they ever return dont miss the halfway point in this action fueled weekly series exploring the three greatest heroes of all time

5798233 at its peak ipv6 represented less than one hundredth of 1 percent of internet traffic
5798234 this is somewhat equivalent to the allowed parts of contaminants in drinking water
5798235 we believe this is the largest study of ipv6 and internet traffic in general to date by several orders of magnitude
5798236 though not a landslide of adoption it is still something
5798237 the us has historically been quite sluggish and most ipv6 research and implementation has been in europe and asia
5798238 two or three years ago you could make the argument that the exhaustion of ipv4 addresses is far enough away that we dont need to make the investment
5798239 now is the time for large isps and content providers to begin their migration
5798240 this massive expense comes without the lure of additional revenue since ipv6 offers diminishingly few incentives nor new competitive features to attract or upsell customers
5798241 they can suffer problems through corporate mergers because both parties might be using the same address space or they find they have a lot of network address translators which can make it challenging to deploy new applications ipv6 helps both those problems

5798249 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
5798250 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5798251 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5798252 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5798253 we appreciate the enthusiasm of our developers and were excited that youre so passionate about the android platform thanks for taking the time to send this

5798267 it has only paid out 4m so far although 125 000 people have been robbed of their pensions
5798268 the government said it had put in place laws which would make employer pension schemes completely safe and ensure that the employer had put enough money in to fund the pensions
5798269 we are here to safeguard the savings of the 12 million people who are members of eligible defined benefit occupational pension schemes
5798270 the payments we will now make show we are doing just that and those affected can be reassured that their income every month comes from a known trusted and stable source
5798271 we had no idea that things were going so wrong with the company and it was a big worry when it all collapsed
5798272 at that stage we did not know whether i would get my pension or not
5798273 to have invested in my pension for 26 and lost it all would have been a huge blow
5798274 it sends out an important message of reassurance to more than 100 000 scheme members currently in assessment and to scheme members set to come through our doors in the future that they can look forward to security in retirement
5798275 with company contributions at no less than those currently provided
5798276 there can be no doubt that the unions were misled over this issue and that a deliberate attempt was made to delay serious discussion until the sale was complete
5798277 this is completely unacceptable the union acted in good faith throughout the negotiations and the decision may well lead to a dispute with airwave
5798278 during the discussions the union had clearly registered its concerns that members would not know what pension arrangements would be in place in the new company
5798279 it will not pay to save for many of those who need this help most such as those women who can only afford to save a little because they are on low incomes or have broken employment records
5798280 this could damage consumer confidence and put the success of the governments pension reforms at risk
5798281 personal accounts will provide a low cost simple means of saving for retirement and with a mandatory employer contribution will offer good incentives to save
5798282 think long and hard about it and look at other forms of savings besides pension schemes
5798283 it does get to me i have to say im not saying im angry about it every day but when i start to think about it i have to stop
5798284 by this time id hopefully have been going on a couple of holidays a year im not saying big holidays but a weekend here and maybe a week somewhere else its just sort of week to week now really
5798285 when richardsons first closed down the first thing was id applied for early retirement to get early retirement you had to be over 60 and i had just turned 60
5798286 so i thought ill still try and get early retirement then i was told that when a firm goes into liquidation the pension scheme is frozen and there is no early retirement so that was the first blow
5798287 then eventually we were told that when the pension scheme was wound up the money to wind it up had come from the scheme itself so in those circumstances we were told we would be lucky to get 25 of our pensions
5798288 first of all i said ive five years to try and survive until my pension comes but then i said what do i do now i havent even a pension to look forward to i tried to apply for jobs i dont know how many i applied for but ive no qualifications
5798289 those 27 years in richardsons were specialised work if you like and theres no other similar factory i could have worked in
5798290 im still not sure how much im getting id of course like 100 of it but weve been told we should get about 80 which will equate to about 125 each week
5798291 we think what we are doing today strikes the right balance in targeting it personal accounts and making sure people can make enough contribution
5798292 pleased that the government has listened to our concerns we can live with this
5798293 today is a significant day in the history of pensions and should be recognised as such
5798294 we are particularly pleased to see that ministers have held fast to their rejection of the call made by some employers to introduce a waiting period before new employees could claim an employer contribution
5798295 rocketing household bills over the past few years have put a major strain on the finances of many pensioners yet up to 4 2 billion in money benefits is left unclaimed by older people every year
5798296 the proposal which will benefit all policyholders to transfer with profits annuity policies to prudential is a further major success arising from the societys ongoing review of strategic options
5798297 the board has been very conscious of the particular difficulties faced by with profits annuitants and we are pleased to have negotiated this excellent proposition for them
5798298 they will become part of an actively managed fund which is one of the largest and strongest in the uk
5798299 work is an important social lifeline and consequently we are seeing a significant number of older people planning to work beyond state pension age either in a paid capacity or in the voluntary sector

5798312 there is a clear underlying trend towards a reduced pension promise for todays workers compared with past generations
5798313 one of the main objectives of pension reforms in oecd countries has been to cut public pension expenditures and make pension systems financially sustainable in the face of population ageing
5798314 perhaps surprisingly there is little evidence of an increased pensions contribution burden in this period

5798368 heating costs this winter will be difficult for most of us and could be tragic for far too many governor patrick senate president murray and speaker dimasi recently formed a winter heating task force to marshal all of the states best solutions for dealing with this impending challenging winter
5798369 we are already seeing greatly increased demand for energy efficiency services as consumers take steps to get ready for the winter now the utilities and other service providers are working to meet that demand and it is good to see them stepping forward

5798371 expanding the existing efficiency programs is the most cost effective way to reduce high energy costs and will provide economic health and environmental benefits for many years into the future

5798376 we are pleased to offer our new sorbaypc mist as an effective way to clean the mouth quickly
5798377 our sorbaypc mist and its companion the sorbaypc lozenge do what palate cleansing oral rinses and confections are supposed to do but dont our products remove residual food residues and food flavors from the mouth for those in a rush the new sorbaypc mist provides a quick cleanup the lozenge a more leisurely and thorough cleansing both leave the mouth tasting and feeling clean neither leaves an aftertaste the absence of an aftertaste troubles some first time users because current oral care dogma has led people to expect palate cleansing confections and oral rinses to leave a minty flavor in the mouth unfortunately that aftertaste really means the mouth is more unclean than it was before being exposed to a mint flavored product it is less clean because it is coated with oil mint oil the typical minty palate cleanser does not cleanse the mouth it just covers up an unattractive oral situation with mint aroma and taste not infrequently the original oral problems reemerge as the mint cover up fades a sorbaypc clean mouth is truly clean there is nothing left to reemerge most of us would agree that it is a good idea to begin a meal with clean hands it is an equally good idea to end it with a sorbaypc clean mouth

5798395 creates pressure on hamas and is likely to accelerate the negotiations over kidnapped idf soldier gilad schalit
5798396 the gesture will not make hamas more flexible about its demands because the organization sees that israel is releasing prisoners with blood on their hands which merely causes hamas to harden its position
5798397 hamas is looking despairingly at how despite the fact that it holds shalit it is not succeeding in bringing about a prisoner release while abu mazen abbas who is conducting negotiations with israel is securing a prisoner release
5798398 its enough to see hamas response to the governments decision to understand the pressure the organization is under
5798399 we in hamas got the message and will act accordingly despite the fact that until now our policy regarding prisoner releases was unrelated to political factional belonging
5798400 this committee made up of the commander of forces involved on the ground and special judges must determine the reasons for this incident and the lack of coordination between the command in baghdad and iraqi forces

5798402 they were hitting everyone they disarmed the guards and killed my secretary abbas al tamimi
5798403 the iraqi unit involved in the operation at the diyala governance centre last night was not under the command of coalition forces

5798408 it is very exciting to be on this shipwreck with a crew that is dedicated to solving this mystery
5798409 it sounded outrageous when you have 4 and 5 hour waits and someone stands up and says they think we could get to the point where we are doing it in 30 minutes it has been accomplished
5798410 emergisoft at a high level has given us the information rather than the anecdotes that we need to rigorously manage patients travels through the ed
5798411 we know exactly where they are in any point of the process we know how long it is taking them and we now have an electronic record of exactly when a patient came and when they were treated
5798412 we track the program using emergisofted everyday we get on to see how many patients were not seen within thirty minutes
5798413 we meet everyday to discuss the previous day it is great for the staff so they can see on a day to day basis how they did and what they can do to improve the real time data from emergisoft helps them realize that what they are doing is so great
5798414 the custom report graph really lays out the exact data we are looking for and it has really become our tracking method
5798415 what we are doing is classic continuous performance improvement data from emergisoft really helps us get better day by day
5798416 we are very pleased that emergisofted is supporting nyack hospitals emergency room 30 minute service standard and their commitment to the community to provide the best patient care
5798417 we are now more cohesive than ever everyone is connected in the whole hospital our focus is on the patient
5798418 i think the service guarantee has completely changed our reputation in the community
5798419 ive been here almost 3 years and when i first got here we didnt have a great reputation in the community but because of the service standard we are able to get a lot of word of mouth and our volume has been up about 20 i think that is directly related to the better service we are providing
5798420 the survey shows that the institutional marketplace is slow to break from tradition when it comes to adopting ldi

5798437 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5798438 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5798439 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5798440 there were very violent battles that lasted several hours and an operation is still ongoing in the zone
5798441 these soldiers were doing their duty but they did not die for france they died in an unending war that the united states is waging in that country for its own interests

5798450 we are protesting in a non violent way but the state government and centre is yet to wake up and now we have started this jail bharo agitation
5798451 it is a mass movement people are taking this agitation forward surely we will win the centre too is nervous now
5798452 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5798453 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5798454 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5798455 and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5798456 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that
5798457 i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5798458 proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional us1 billion 1 15 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5798459 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5798460 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience versus barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics

5798509 twelve months ago i was desperate to play for england the numbers six and seven places were up for grabs and i was happy to make that my own
5798510 but number three is what ive done for middlesex for eight or nine years and i know exactly what is required in that role
5798511 i feel i can do a good job at three given a reasonable run its nice for the captain to back me to deliver a performance in a key position
5798512 a batsman like kevin pietersen is how i could challenge myself and say right thats the standard
5798513 if i do get a run and establish myself then ill be setting the sort of standards that kevin sets
5798514 and maybe one day i might be the best batter in the team i dont know time will tell
5798515 i think most batsmen have the ambition to move up the only reason for going up the order is to get the opportunity to score hundreds
5798516 i was lucky enough to get a hundred at six with the way the game went but now i am really delighted to get the chance to bat at three
5798517 ive been told to go and play the way i play if the ball isnt doing much ill play some shots
5798518 if it is moving a bit ill sit in and get through the new ball just do what is right for the team
5798519 when youre going at six the ball tends to be old and is doing a bit less
5798520 at three you could be in second ball or the 10th over and the ball is still doing a bit
5798521 you get more value for your shots if you pierce the field compared to batting at six where you start slowly and pick up your scoring rate
5798522 im looking to play the same role as i have in the past for middlesex the only difference being a different shirt

5798563 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
5798564 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
5798565 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans

5798702 i had a frantic mother come to me the other day in tears
5798703 she told me that her son timothy invited several of his friends over into his bedroom for private prayer and devotional scripture studies send shivers down the spine of every god fearing mother and father in our christian nation satan is in our midst my friends the devil is using olympics volleyball to lure young men into shedding their clothes flopping around and falling off off their beds with him into the pit of iniquity lucifer is turning innocent afternoon gatherings of imprecatory prayer into frenzied young masturbating baptist boys clubs
5798704 heard not the sacred sounds of scripture readings accompanied by soft sweet whispers to our heavenly father but rather a noisy television set spewing
5798705 timothys head was peeking out from under the pimpled rump of his prayer leader
5798706 they were all on the bedroom floor covered in sweat their stiffened purple tallywhackers pointing in every direction

5798717 or even implying that the troopers would ever commit these acts of violence even in response to such obvious challenges to their authority as rebels invading their space and doing violence to their machinery by interfering with that machinerys lawful use would send absolutely the wrong message to theatergoers and would give the wrong impression of mr vaders ultimately peaceful intentions
5798718 not only is it vital once again that the right message be sent to audience members by showing these rebels being put in a position to take responsibility for their actions but it would also be terribly unrealistic to expect these peaceful rebels to put up with these actions that would simply give darth vader the excuse he needs to blow up the planet the disrespectful hooligans must be turned over to the empire promptly and without question
5798719 just another example of the empires harmful philosophy coming in by the back door

5798732 satan was correct in saying that this man had sinned i wont deny any of these allegations and yes the wages of sins is death and this man deserves to be punished
5798733 however i died on the cross so that this person might have eternal life and he has accepted me as his savior so he is mine
5798734 his name is written in the book of life and no one can snatch him from me satan still does not understand yet this man is not to be given justice but rather mercy

5798755 the game of tennis is similar to the game of life
5798756 its a one on one sport where theres no one coaching you on the court and you have to figure it out on your own when your match is over is when you can get advice on what you did right and what you did wrong but for the most part it requires incredible self discipline and self control
5798757 my parents taught me that if you want something its up to you to get out there and bust your butt to make it happen
5798758 no one is going to hand anything to you my parents are my role models
5798759 while i was training in florida they graciously hosted me and my coach plus they also give me great advice about tennis and on life in general
5798760 because i was on the court instead of in the streets i escaped the life that so many young black brothers fall victim to gangs jail and teenage fatherhood
5798761 i made it a personal goal for myself to teach as many children the game of tennis as possible in hopes of seeing them get a tennis scholarship to attend college and saving their parents money
5798762 i figure if they can get into college on a tennis scholarship after about two years they might consider going pro
5798763 seeing an adult or a child hit their first tennis ball and it makes it over the net and stays in the court is a very rewarding feeling
5798764 as a tennis instructor nothing can compare to being there to witness your student whether theyre children or adults win their first match or tournament thats what i enjoy most about teaching tennis
5798765 come out to the arthur ashe tennis courts on a saturday morning we have adults young adults and children mostly black right here from south los angeles playing tennis in addition we have blacks come from all over southern california to play tennis at the arthur ashe tennis center because this is where most blacks who play tennis play in l a theres a real sense of camaraderie and focus ing anyone interested in learning how to play theres nothing white or bourgeoisie about the game of tennis during south africas apartheid arthur ashe was denied a visa by the south african government keeping him out of the south african open he used the opportunity to call attention to south africas racism against blacks the williams sisters came straight out of compton in fact most people arent aware that there is still a lot of racism in tennis against blacks just ask venus and serena black people need to realize that when we use terms like acting white and bourgeoisie we discourage each other from reaching our full potential its no different than when kids tease each with acting white for being good students and brining home as on their report cards for me it comes down to knowing where your child is after school or for them to act black and join a gang and run the streets eventually ending up in jail or worse dead tennis is an opportunity much like we view basketball and football for our youth both females and males to excel in life why should white children be the only ones taking advantage of that
5798766 regina recently won her first tournament her sister maya pitts is fast on reginas heels at the age of five maya can already hit the ball from the baseline i credit the success of richard williams and his daughters venus and serena with inspiring a whole new generation of black tennis players the way that arthur ashe inspired me
5798767 stay focused and enjoy yourself always play the game of tennis with a smile on your face it helps theres nothing that you cant do with practice

5798783 i wanted to do a song about what teenager girls go through in urban areas its not cool that boys think theyre being cute when they say nasty stuff to us on the street

5798785 its about guys who simply see young women as sex objects but i refuse to be that girl

5798802 i was angry at everyone i would kick a dog even
5798803 sometimes i ate cooked rice with a strong bad smell and the curry was a blend of green roots a spoonful of saffron powder and a good amount of water after two or three months of living on such food my tongue and stomach started wriggling in a search for their usual stimuli so much so that i sometimes felt like chewing my own thigh
5798804 the years i spent in prison were by far the most efficient and productive time of my life

5798806 thank you very much for new books of berryman papa and donald hall id like to request more books of samuel beckett and hermann hesse
5798807 i came out of prison not with plans but with dreams
5798808 i shouldnt have been angry that much freedom of expression became less important to me than freedom from anger freedom from destruction freedom from repentance freedom from dilemmas i wanted a peaceful and strong state of mind as long as my mind is weak i cannot do anything i found values more important than any political ideology
5798809 when the u n comes here someone always wants to see me
5798810 they tell me theyre sorry about the situation to be patient
5798811 the only solution is for the u s to drop a bomb on naypyidaw thats the only way ninety per cent of burmese would tell you the same thing the world is very angry at america because of iraq if you use one per cent of the money and one per cent of the bombs here the world will see you in a better way
5798812 he said for example the u n states that a third of the children under five are malnourished thats absolutely not true the real figure is 31 2 per cent the u n states that three quarters of an average familys income is used on food thats actually not true its 68 7 per cent he was using our statistics to say there was no poverty that everything was fine
5798813 for the army leadership the country is essentially a huge counter insurgency battlefield
5798814 peoples desire oppose those relying on external elements acting as stooges holding negative views oppose those trying to jeopardize stability of the state and progress of the nation oppose foreign nations interfering in internal affairs of the state crush all internal and external destructive elements as the common enemy
5798815 there are certain cultural practices that help maintain the regime burmese society is a hierarchical society where obedience to authority is taught in the family in religious institutions in educational institutions
5798816 if you ask burmese students to paraphrase something they cannot do it
5798817 we can blame the religion and we can blame the live and let live attitude of the burmese
5798818 even people like me unless we go out of the country from time to time to refresh our minds we become conditioned to the suppression we are fearful without knowing we are fearful and we are submissive without knowing we are submissive
5798819 here the government isnt dependent on the people and the people arent dependent on the government when theres no electricity or water you get it yourself
5798820 i meet some people older people theyre just telling their old stories the political history of our country and i feel sorry for them
5798821 they want to help their community but they only sit in their cell telling the old stories i got a new idea from them my idea is that i want to do something outside prison so i can help other people maybe im a results oriented person and in prison we dont get results thats labor lost
5798822 sometimes my brain is blocked by something and i cant get through that block and find the answer that is a human theme
5798823 american people say that political changes will change the conditions in our country
5798824 thats true but i think we need to develop our own capacities we are not ready for democracy we dont have any good platform good foundation to get those changes
5798825 where does that garbage come from people throw it recklessly when there was a flood people said that is the responsibility of yangon city development committee it was their fault
5798826 but you cant just say you should take the responsibility thats why i want to use the arts i want to teach people critical thinking
5798827 are we capturing killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting training and deploying against us
5798828 based on my experience in talking to al qaeda members
5798829 futile and immoral policy of containment which abandons countless human beings to a despotism and godless terrorism
5798830 im not going to be the one to announce this decision you need to address your interest in this to the state department
5798831 has mostly been to play charlie brown perennially falling down as lucy yanks away the football swearing not to be fooled again
5798832 an action opposed by russia and china will not suddenly gain new legitimacy in russian or chinese eyes simply because a group from which they are excluded says so
5798833 his knowledge and ability to talk about it reemphasized that this is the guy whos ready to be commander in chief
5798834 its a very clear choice and whether it be on iran or whether it be on iraq or whether it be on other national security issues
5798835 senator obama does not have the experience and the knowledge and clearly the judgment my friends
5798836 i will not accept from senator obama who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform any lectures on my regard for those who did
5798837 liberals saw the savagery of the 9 11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers
5798838 we have only two choices appeasement or war suicide or surrender humiliation or holocaust to be either red or dead
5798839 since 9 11 our principal export to the world has been our fear
5798840 when people feel uncertain theyd rather have somebody whos strong and wrong than somebody whos weak and right
5798841 securing stabilizing and rebuilding iraq progress report some gains made updated strategy needed
5798842 coercive interrogation techniques do they work are they reliable and what did the fbi know about them
5798843 this made fraz nearly choke as he thought i was telling him that i love his mouth which ya know i obviously do because his mouth is super hot d
5798844 come inside while we wait for the police to arrive
5798845 as a nineteen year old girl i might not have any knowledge about democracy
5798846 but i had the sense to distinguish right from wrong
5798847 i was already a writer and i thought this would be a new experience
5798848 so we pool the money from donations in a bank and get some interest
5798849 they want us to cry we have to cry we are living with our body but with their soul
5798850 they fear their commanders more than they fear punishment in the next life
5798851 as a mother would risk her life to protect her child her only child even so should one cultivate a limitless heart with regard to all beings
5798852 when burmese people suffer normally they dont dare to speak out
5798853 lets meet where we had tea together the last time
5798854 i said september 18th is good because the military took back power that day in 1988
5798855 the generals are superstitious i knew they would go through these calculations
5798856 in september the trend of the demonstration was just like postmodernism because it started everywhere theres no main direction when the government tried to arrest the leader of the demonstration they could not find him or her
5798857 disrupt law and order and destabilize the peace and tranquillity of the state
5798858 im not a professor of political science but i have some experience and i look at things and say this is not an endgame
5798859 many people were in a state of rage hysteria throwing bottles very few people realize the power of silence silence is harder to crush we were expecting a few leaders who like gandhi can meet their death very calmly we didnt see that and we were very disappointed
5798860 the only one like that is aung san suu kyi
5798861 american foreign policy has been outsourced to the exiles and their patrons on the hill theres a lack of interest at the state department in burma
5798862 sanctions are a just a pressure release the generals dont care what the rest of the world thinks about them because they dont think about the rest of the world what they care about is their financial and physical security
5798863 burmese military officers say that they have three cards to play in the international community china india and
5798864 they say they dont need to worry as long as they have these cards
5798865 the regime here unlike regimes elsewhere is trying to prevent the formation of a middle class
5798866 the biggest sanction on burma is the regime no investment no property law no rule of law restrictions on exports and imports corruption off the dial
5798867 its like a spouse not declaring his income and making the family starve even though hes earning a wall street salary
5798868 if theres one thing thats fuelled burmas many problems over the last half century its been its isolation if outside economic relationships are reduced to a few oil companies chinese logging companies and twelve u n agencies its easy for the generals to play games if were talking about thousands of individual business relationships even if it leads to a certain amount of corruption youll have a much more open political space
5798869 in the history of the burmese military pragmatists have never got the upper hand
5798870 in historical terms fifty years is not a long period
5798871 so we may not get to enjoy democracy in our lifetimes but my son or sure of that
5798872 we really wanted to buy them bamboos and plastic sheets
5798873 but we did not do that believing many of them who are eager to start small businesses would resell those materials at a lower price
5798874 they are writers comedians engineers doctors small groups but they become like activists
5798875 regime change can happen in many ways besides mass revolution
5798876 we will see more chaos than organized struggle against the regime
5798877 but i also sense the end of the regime is getting nearer and nearer
5798878 were trying to uphold pure humanitarian a concept the generals dont recognize were always trying to control the idiocy of their actions because it always gets interpreted negatively outside and has a major impact on peoples willingness to help
5798879 all of us together suffered thats how we can survive
5798880 when i was younger i hoped and waited for outside help to come to our country and liberate it
5798881 now i realize that we have to rely on ourselves
5798882 okay this is top secret no one must know edward youre agent stud muffin jasper youre agent dream boat and im agent hot stuff
5798883 tan solo seremos libres cuando no haya m s que perder

5798894 calling key state gop officials around the country the last couple of days and sounding them out about the consequences of a pro choice vp pick
5798895 option and if you put in your zip code or country it will give you the costs of any types of shipping being offered
5798896 absolutely happy customer goods as descrbed and arrived promptly a
5798897 well i used to be a republican until they lost their minds
5798898 ill put my cards on the table im not sure how were going to pull this off while the aps value to us has been severely diminished over the years it still does provide a handful of services that we havent been able to find elsewhere yet im betting however that its only a matter of time more likely well use that time to become essentially 100 percent local which is probably where were headed eventually anyway
5798899 the worst value for anything we purchase since we use so little of what were paying for
5798900 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5798901 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
5798902 theres a sense that origin has gotten quite a positive response on its csg monetisation process but thats still in early days so its hard to decide which is a better option
5798903 its difficult to say what bg might do theres a high chance they will wait until they get more details on the csg monetisation proposals origin has received but they could also make a pre emptive strike and launch a higher offer
5798904 the introduction of lng channels to market for csg from eastern australia has the potential to further increase domestic gas prices
5798905 shareholders should also be aware that brokers average 12 month share price targets ranging from a 17 01 to a 20 00 are materially above bgs offer
5798906 i think the rules are that pedi cabs arent supposed to be clogging up bike lanes generally
5798907 sorry for a pessimistic comment as of late i have the unfortunate displeasure of working in midtown and was really excited about this project when i first heard about it but most
5798908 i love the new blvd bike lane but its also very popular with pedicabs which is fine as long as i can overtake them but im concerned theyre going to put so many
5798909 it doesnt matter if silver says hes for congestion pricing if he continues his strategy of refusing to bring it to a vote because he says his members are overwhelmingly
5798910 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5798911 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5798912 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5798913 and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5798914 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that
5798915 i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5798916 proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional us1 billion 1 15 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5798917 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5798918 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience versus barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics

5798927 this committee made up of the commander of forces involved on the ground and special judges must determine the reasons for this incident and the lack of coordination between the command in baghdad and iraqi forces
5798928 during the night iraqi forces from baghdad burst into the provincial council building
5798929 they were hitting everyone they disarmed the guards and killed my secretary abbas al tamimi
5798930 the iraqi unit involved in the operation at the diyala governance centre last night was not under the command of coalition forces
5798931 this was an iraqi planned and executed operation without the involvement of the coalition forces an american air weapons team was in the vicinity of the incident but did not engage any targets
5798932 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country

5798941 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5798942 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5798943 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5798944 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5798945 there were very violent battles that lasted several hours and an operation is still ongoing in the zone
5798946 these soldiers were doing their duty but they did not die for france they died in an unending war that the united states is waging in that country for its own interests

5799028 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5799029 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5799030 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5799031 the first game will probably be a big learning experience
5799032 were dealing with a weakening economy in the second half of this year and early 09 doesnt look that great either
5799033 we dont have any numbers that really show stabilization in the housing market yet
5799034 i am grateful to the people who decided that i should come to beijing and all the people who supported me
5799035 i felt i had no alternative but to win gold here in order justify their faith in me
5799036 it was the decision of the authorities i dont think i have to call anyone
5799037 i hardly see them of course even though i live there with them i am travelling so much but they were at home watching and supporting me
5799038 my elder brother was a member of the local club he practised the triple jump and i decided i would have a go i started in athletics at the age of seven i tried everything first but as i grew i realised that the high jump might be a better idea
5799039 well i dont want to go over that again briefly i tried to correct all the mistakes i made last year and during this competition i consulted my coach after each jump so the he could correct my technique
5799040 not really its a bit too soon to think about that
5799041 i was a bit sad that stefan did not win silver because he has been a great ambassador for the sport he is a great sportsman
5799042 it happens and will continue to happen because none us is young forever
5799043 its important that our team take good care of him right now
5799044 our team needs to keep him in the loop an injury like that to an athlete is a difficult situation but we have a good group of guys on this team and good team chemistry and its their job to keep him in the loop
5799045 you ran out of bounds dont run out of bounds you dont have to do that
5799046 the third day i went from no 3 to no 1 linebacker youve got to love that there was no going back after that
5799047 its nice laying out the punches rather than taking them
5799048 let people know youre here and you aint going nowhere for the next 60 minutes
5799049 at the beginning of the game you have to impose your will and make them not want to be there for the next 60 minutes
5799050 but this is my last year and my main goal is to win
5799051 whatever i need to do to make that happen thats what i was willing to do after putting all that into perspective it was an easy decision
5799052 its not about me its about the team weve got some good running backs over there with marlon and roy and q they can handle the load im going to come over and make this defense better
5799053 it was the best opportunity to start fresh because i messed up as a sophomore wearing number 8 and i wanted to start as a new person as number 4
5799054 i think when things didnt go well early in the season he lost a bit of confidence
5799055 he wanted to get back to doing what he knew how to do
5799056 i didnt cope with it well but the team was doing well so i couldnt get mad at that
5799057 i was trying to stay positive but i knew someones numbers would drop because of our depth at receiver
5799058 i think he decided that it was important to him and he knew he was a good football player so it was time to go out there and prove it
5799059 i came with a better mind set and went hard and did what it takes
5799060 i talked to my family and they told me to keep my head up

5799064 he didnt want to come out but i dont need to see him right now he got a lot of work today though and felt good
5799065 it really kind of went on for a few days and just kind of got progressively worse
5799066 even up til right before they came in and told me i had appendicitis that was the last thing on my mind it kind of really snuck up on me and really wasnt the telltale signs of appendicitis
5799067 any time you are out nothing can replace the pounding and change of direction and shedding blocks like just good old fashioned getting in there and getting the work done
5799068 im really hoping to build that up as we progress through these last weeks of camp
5799069 i can understand why people are very upset and why theyre very worried and concerned about their ability to deal with these high prices

5799071 as a registered nurse i care about my patients health unfortunately the insurance companies care about making money

5799084 the state of connecticut may have finished the last fiscal year with a surplus but our families did not it is crucial that we get these funds back to families many of them struggling to make ends meet so that they can keep the heat on this winter
5799085 right now were looking at how to leverage the surplus to have the biggest impact on families budgets
5799086 we know that because of skyrocketing energy costs we must essentially double the amount of state aide from last winter just to maintain the same benefits for connecticuts most vulnerable families in addition we want to expand help for middle class families we are now working with gov rells office and our colleagues in the house to hammer out the details

5799099 altro che gomorra questo il libro pi bello che abbiamo letto questanno
5799100 il libro recente vincitore del premio vittorini 2008 di assoluto impatto emotivo longo utilizza una lingua molto vicina a quella delle periferie partenopee sembra di guardare un film tanto le espressioni utilizzate dai protagonisti dei 10 episodi sono reali ed asciutte non ci troviamo di fronte ad una replica di gomorra ma il testo ci lascia ancora pi sbalorditi tratteggiando con estrema semplicit espressiva quello che sappiamo capita nelle nostre citt ma che tante volte ci ostiniamo a non vedere o prendere in considerazione sicuramente un libro da leggere
5799101 dieci come i pugni allo stomaco che lautore riesce ad assestare in maniera magistrale alle nostre coscienze con uno stile narrativo asciutto ed essenziale
5799102 in the minds of most people you rarely spend money to get nothing done

5799112 i don t know if it s going to be for these last two preseason games or for sept 7th the date of the regular season opener against the cincinnati bengals but i do know that when i m truly healthy i will be back on the field the ravens have compensated for gaithers absence by primarily using chad slaughter at left tackle with mike kracalik also getting a few reps on the left side the youthful but inexperienced offensive line could use a boost from gaithers return but the tackle said he is not pressing the issue i ve been pushing myself the whole time
5799113 there s added pressure anyway with a new playbook a new system just a whole new philosophy so i don t want to put any pressure on myself or my ankle

5799125 our group of freshmen along with our junior college transfer will be big contributors for us this season
5799126 they each bring a dynamic set of skills that will help our club and make every player around them better
5799127 both ames and thalman played well for us with ames becoming a key part of our success in the latter half of our season she helped us pick up two big wcc wins including the win over 13th ranked santa clara
5799128 danielson provides size and strength in the goal and will be a very welcome addition to our goalkeeper lineup
5799129 the depth at our keeper position will allow us to push our keepers in order to find the starting goalkeeper for our team
5799130 we are excited about the combination of riley jones and our young freshman rhodes we are expecting good things from this group this season each player has the ability to make big plays
5799131 sarah compliments riley and jones very well she brings a wide variety of skillful passes and can really finish an offensive attack she will be a great asset for us throughout the season and her career
5799132 our veteran players in hall and dagostino will serve important roles as defensive center midfielders this season both players have the skill set to play physical and both distribute the ball very effectively
5799133 conrad gave us a much needed offensive spark last season and in the final couple games proved to us that she can be an attacking threat her diving header to lift us past pepperdine in double overtime was one of the highlights of last season dascenzo played a valuable role for us last year and we are expecting a solid senior season from her
5799134 we add a talented freshman in dolcetti to our frontline with dascenzo and conrad dolcetti is a big strong tall target and will work well in the box for us
5799135 with conrad dascenzo and dolcetti we now have size speed and experience on our front line
5799136 id like also to bring up again the issue of perl ying its true that perl is not dying but it is also true that it is in decline to ask a similar question to dave if perl is in such rude health why do we have to give away free training sessions as simon rightly says there are other dynamic languages which have stolen a march on perl in recent years
5799137 our proposal will be designed to ensure the smoothfunctioning of the markets
5799138 we supportthe equally important role of bets on the upside and on thedownside

5799142 as an artist and inventor i have come up with an invention that will solve all of the worlds problems i have invented an air engine that has the power to operate an automobile while relying on air as its fuel source adoption of this technology would mean an end to reliance on fossil fuels stopping carbon monoxide emissions pollution and global warming
5799143 finally i would like to sound the alarm that aipac and other jewish zionist lobbies who represent less than 2 of american people are using the united states through their mighty power in the news media financial institutions hollywood and entertainment industry both political parties congress and the white house as proxy to wage war against any country perceived to be threat to israel like in iraq

5799165 we certainly dont think were going to replace darlington but what weve done is given southeastern fans an opportunity to have an event back in the southeast at a long time nascar speedway
5799166 well be celebrating our 50th year of racing next year this event certainly will be the keystone event of that celebration
5799167 it offers a lot of opportunities to people to maybe expand their attendance there are a lot of attractions and things in and around the atlanta area that they may enjoy as well as the race
5799168 were going to call on those partners to help us build this weekend and make it really really special were going to add the element of night racing which makes the cars even as fast as they are at atlanta seem even faster and just really make this a special weekend that becomes a tradition in itself very much like darlington has been for so many years
5799169 ive watched fans come to this sport ive watched them brave the elements of unfathomable heat on labor day and rain delayed events during february
5799170 they continue to come back theyre passionate about writing and telling us what they want
5799171 were really about growth as long as were continuing to see that then we believe were making the kind of impact we need to be making for the sport we feel that during the chase well be seeing that in 2009
5799172 the 09 schedule that you see is a result of realignment and the realignment is a result of requests that came from atlanta and auto club speedway that initiated the chain reaction of everything on the schedule
5799173 labor day is a national holiday across the entire country and i think its significant because it signifies wherever you might be the end of summer as much as anything else
5799174 but the result was a collaboration of auto club speedway and atlanta so darlington never was a factor in this conversation
5799175 i wouldnt say that there were any heartburns or negative issues to it
5799176 we have some experience there with the grand national divisions racing there
5799177 the competitors that had been there speak very highly of it we went by to look at the and theres no question that the facility is first rate

5799188 y quisiera rescatar sobre el tema de las plazas que no existe la posibilidad de que sea desechado el proceso legislativo que se est llevando para la iniciativa que present el gobernador para autorizar las plazas
5799189 es decir que el primer error que se est cometiendo es creer que el congreso puede dejar sin estudiar la propuesta que hizo el gobernador tenemos ese asunto en comisiones se est estudiando y tiene que agotarse su an lisis no termina el proceso legislativo de la solicitud de plazas porque el gobernador ya no cambi de opini n eso no sucede

5799204 that developed nations should stop paying agricultural subsidies to encourage biofuel production because those payments are making staple foods more expensive
5799205 the use of us croplands for biofuels causes increased greenhouse gas emissions through emissions from land use change
5799206 any time you are in the hospital its got to be pretty serious
5799207 these results suggest that a portion of corn stover could be harvested for biofuel production without reducing soil organic carbon levels in high yielding systems however since this study did not study the direct impact of stover removal that aspect remains to be evaluated
5799208 the cork industry in general is under attack one could say from alternative wine bottle closures
5799209 if cork growers lose the cash interest they will plant something else jeopardizing the sustainability chain

5799212 always process mad his phrase farber seems to have trained himself to experience as though microscopically and in slow motion contradictions within a film
5799213 just one result of his inveterate habit of repeated viewings and reconsiderations of a given film his attempt to go beyond his private reactions to accommodate plural perspectives and the fact that he is admittedly unable to write anything at all without extraordinary amounts of rewriting
5799214 its just that im going to be dead laughs in five years and i feel sorry for the people wholl come after me
5799215 cinema whose flickering dreams always carried within them a sense of departure increasingly becomes a long list of the dead and now as the century ends its fashionable to talk of the death of cinema as though this was somehow premature rather than just a part of the process in a wider technological revolution
5799216 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought

5799230 heartened to learn that most voters dont buy into the spoiler argument being espoused by partisan talking heads thats how russell verney campaign manager for barr and former campaign manager for h ross perot puts it
5799231 people want real change and they know that they are not going to get it from a republican or a democrat verney says
5799232 americas only hope for change is by allowing more competition in the political process and that means opening the debates to any candidate who can meet the ballot access criteria
5799233 enough state ballots to have at least a mathematical chance of securing an electoral college majority in the 2008 general election

5799240 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias

5799260 i believe this officer did the best he could but unfortunately mistakes were made and we lacked confidence in the persuasiveness of our case
5799261 we still have a belief in eadys guilt which made for an agonizing decision
5799262 i expect that there will be shades of the truth told in a trial
5799263 but we rely on certain foundational things that someone is not going to tell a straight out lie this is very frustrating and disturbing
5799264 americas reputation as an international leader rests in the hands of our youth
5799265 claiming that us as well as nato and israeli military assistance to georgia is destabilizing the region
5799266 comply with nato regulations in terms of military requirements as well as social conditions

5799274 our ability to test these technologies has not kept pace with our ability to create them
5799275 innovation teams do not seem to consider the testing technologies required to accompany that innovation but testing has become more important than ever at idt we spend much time researching the latest testing technologies and have come up with the which we are currently refining further
5799276 software testing is now also driving the business executives can have the best business ideas but if the software and testing teams dont deliver or the testing efforts are behind the competition is only a few clicks away
5799277 if 10 defects occur very frequently and impact critical functionality that would usually be perceived by a customer as poor quality even if that defect density was very low
5799278 testing often gets blamed for missed deadlines projects that are over budget uncovered production defects and lack of innovation
5799279 such as the black box approach where millions of source lines of code are developed including vast amount of functionality only for it to be handed over to a test team so they can test and peel the layers of code painstakingly finding one defect after another sometimes not uncovering a major showstopper until another defect is fixed
5799280 another big pain point can be lack of unit testing statistics show and my experience can back them up that the more effective the unit testing efforts the smoother and shorter the system testing efforts will be
5799281 while this is not a bad idea even if we implemented the best processes and had the most brilliant developers in house developers dont test software development is an art and integration and system testing will always be required
5799282 they dont have time they dont specialize in testing and testing techniques they are busy churning out new code and functionality
5799283 regardless of how talented and meticulous a developer is bugs and security vulnerabilities will be found in any body of code open source or commercial given this inevitably its critical that all developers take the time and measures to find and fix these errors
5799284 developers are strapped cranking out new features first to market is the key
5799285 at idt we like the concept of checking out software components within a library setting as a means to support software component reuse
5799286 we support these library and software reuse concepts by allowing for reuse of automated baseline processes and automated testing of those various tasks
5799287 the goal is to improve our perceived quality we can accomplish this by what we have described and by focusing our testing on the most often used functionality which absolutely has to work the usability of most often used functionality mean time to failure and reliability which we define as the probability that no failure will occur in the next n time interval
5799288 these planes are being customized as per our requirement if we get some buyer we may sell them and if not then we can use them with one stop to us or go in for nonstop flights once fuel prices fall to make such flights viable
5799289 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
5799290 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5799291 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5799292 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5799293 banks are trying pre closure of existing live derivative contracts citing the default clause
5799294 continuing worries about a us economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also to asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5799295 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5799296 could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5799297 both want to bring home the troops the great difference is that i want to win the war first
5799298 this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious political risk it was a clarifying moment it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5799299 as i have long warned russia under the rule of vladimir putin is becoming more aggressive toward the now democratic nations that broke free of the old soviet empire
5799300 should be able to count on the free world for support if i am elected president it will
5799301 the cold war is over the soviet empire is gone and neither one is missed least of all is that empire missed by the once captive nations of estonia latvia lithuania poland ukraine and georgia these brave young democracies have joined the free world and they are not going back
5799302 for that reason we should drill offshore and we should drill now congress should come off its five week vacation and go to work for us
5799303 know better than anyone how inattention to small crises can invite much larger ones
5799304 through decades of struggle free nations prevailed over tyranny in large measure because of the sacrifices of the men and women of the united states armed forces
5799305 increases in funding will be matched by increases in accountability
5799306 i will make sure that congress funds the va health care budget in a sufficient timely and predictable manner
5799307 we should no longer tolerate requiring veterans to make an appointment to stand in one line for a ticket to stand in another
5799308 my reforms will not force anyone to go to a non va facility they will not signal privatization of the va and they will not replace any scheduled expansion of the va network including those facilities designed to serve veterans living in rural and remote areas
5799309 in its initial version that bill failed to address the no 1 education request that ive heard from career service members and their families the freedom to transfer their benefits to a spouse or a child
5799310 that bill also did nothing to retain the young officer and enlisted leaders who form the backbone of our all volunteer force
5799311 are our inspiration as i suspect all of you vfw members were once theirs
5799312 there is no question that we are joint partners with the army and marine corps in the wars in iraq and afghanistan
5799313 our technology allows us to ensure the safety of personnel and precisely deliver devastating firepower all in a matter of seconds
5799314 as an army veteran myself im thankful to be counted among the ranks of all veterans
5799315 theyll know that theyre not the only ones who lost somebody
5799316 you represent the soul of this nation we are eternally grateful i give you my deepest respect and admiration
5799317 celebrity forget that i am a soldier who loves his country
5799318 it is about fighting so our children and grandchildren also have something worth fighting for

5799330 we appreciate the enthusiasm of our developers and were excited that youre so passionate about the android platform thanks for taking the time to send this
5799331 at its peak ipv6 represented less than one hundredth of 1 percent of internet traffic
5799332 this is somewhat equivalent to the allowed parts of contaminants in drinking water
5799333 we believe this is the largest study of ipv6 and internet traffic in general to date by several orders of magnitude
5799334 though not a landslide of adoption it is still something
5799335 the us has historically been quite sluggish and most ipv6 research and implementation has been in europe and asia
5799336 two or three years ago you could make the argument that the exhaustion of ipv4 addresses is far enough away that we dont need to make the investment
5799337 now is the time for large isps and content providers to begin their migration
5799338 this massive expense comes without the lure of additional revenue since ipv6 offers diminishingly few incentives nor new competitive features to attract or upsell customers
5799339 they can suffer problems through corporate mergers because both parties might be using the same address space or they find they have a lot of network address translators which can make it challenging to deploy new applications ipv6 helps both those problems
5799340 i love you and i think youre doing a great job and your child is proof of it

5799378 depending on the individual in my experience one dose can last from 6 to 40 hours the ability of the therapy to provide immediate relief is something entirely new for sufferers of interstitial cystitis
5799379 women who suffer from this condition may find themselves having to urinate ten or more times per day usually have pain or symptom flares after sexual intercourse and frequently have chronic pelvic pain
5799380 our goal is to bring awareness of the technology to the public

5799384 the scope of the supply problem became more clear in the latest quarter when the five biggest publicly traded oil companies including exxon mobil said their oil output had declined by a total of 614 000 barrels a day even as they posted 44 billion in profits it was the steepest of five consecutive quarters of declines
5799385 its a crisis of leadership a crisis of strategy and a crisis of what the future looks like for the supermajors they are like a deer caught in headlights they know they have to move but they cant decide where to go

5799393 we are trying to understand the regulation of processes that are fundamental to normal cell development and health in humans
5799394 defective cilia are implicated in a wide range of serious illnesses such as polycystic kidney disease retinal degeneration and neurological disorders inappropriate activation of signaling molecules that normally reside at the primary cilium may lead to certain cancers
5799395 ciliogenesis is a fundamental process these structures are found in almost every type of human cell you can imagine
5799396 if we can ever design drugs that will restore the formation and function of cilia even in the presence of cep290 mutations then that would be one way to cure the defects that lead to ciliary diseases

5799413 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
5799414 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas

5799539 he has the right intentions i hope he gets the tools of control that is for the pakistani government to decide and that is for us and the international community to help him with
5799540 afghanistan cannot achieve peace or prosperity without friendly relations with pakistan i hope he recognizes that what they are doing in terms of supporting militancy in afghanistan is causing immense damage to pakistan itself someone has to recognize this need for change and for a modern relationship with afghanistan a civilized relationship i hope it will occur

5799547 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5799548 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5799549 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5799550 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5799551 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5799552 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5799553 pakistan and the united states have a joint interest in fighting terror

5799555 people are looking for a reason to get off the fence the most asked question in america today other than who obamas vice president is going to be is probably when is the bottom and if you even smell as though you are in real estate people ask you that question all day long
5799556 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5799557 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5799558 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5799559 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5799560 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5799561 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5799562 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future

5799593 this booklet is based on the premise that all christians should become expert in their knowledge and use of the gospel not simply so they can share it faithfully with non christians but also so they can speak it to themselves every day and experience its benefits in fact if christians would do more preaching of the gospel to themselves non christians might have less trouble comprehending its message for they would see its truth and power exuding from believers in indisputable ways

5799597 un rival dif cil turqu a es una muy buena selecci n juega muy r pido tiene jugadores bastante interesantes y a nosotros nos sirve todo lo que para llegar a jugar con brasil y colombia

5799599 la diferencia est en que se te exige m s pero eso es totalmente com n porque hay entrenadores que te exigen m s otros menos y uno tiene que ponerse al ritmo de quien est a cargo que en este caso de marcelo bielsa si l pide algo hay que hacerlo y mi disposici n siempre ha sido la misma

5799617 accordingly a provision is ambiguous only if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable constructions despite the plain meaning of its terms within the context of the policy as a whole
5799618 the terms in an insurance policy must be read in context and in reference to the policy as a whole with each clause helping to interpret the other cal civ code 1641 bay cities paving amp grading inc v lawyers mutual ins co 5 cal 4th 854 867 21 cal rptr 2d 691 855 p 2d 1263 1993 palmer v truck ins exch 21 cal 4th 1109 1115 90 cal rptr 2d 647 988 p 2d 568 1999
5799619 a court faced with an argument for coverage based on an assertedly ambiguous policy language must first attempt to determine whether coverage is consistent with the insureds reasonable expectations id and i n so doing must interpret the language in context with regard to its intended function within the policy id
5799620 sony argues that the term negligent publication should have a broad meaning which it derives from stringing together the dictionary definitions of negligent and publication according to sony negligent publication in the aislic policy refers to a communication of information to the public lacking or exhibiting a lack of due care or concern sony argues that this definition broad enough to include the false advertising and negligent misrepresentation claims in the kim kaen lawsuits is the plain meaning of the term
5799621 w e hold that the term negligent publication in the aislic policy refers to a very narrow tort in which the publication of material encourages or instructs readers to engage in harmful conduct we reject sonys expansive definition as inconsistent with the context of the policy as a whole and unsupported by the case law sony a sophisticated purchaser clearly could have purchased coverage for product defects or false advertising indeed sony previously held an insurance policy with aislic that covered any error or omission misstatement misleading statement or misinterpretation yet the policy at issue in this lawsuit did not include such coverage
5799622 the kim kaen complaints did not allege that the defects in the playstation 2 caused them to experience a loss of use of game discs or dvds t hough it is undisputed that certain discs did not properly play on the playstation 2 the complaints never suggested that the discs themselves did not function properly on other devices id in this respect the suit is easily distinguishable from the loss of use cases sony cites in which the insureds defective property rendered the property of a third party unusable see anthem elecs inc v pac employers ins co 302 f 3d 1049 1057 9th cir 2002 defective circuit boards inserted into scanners of third party plaintiff rendered scanners unusable
5799623 communication of information to the public lacking or exhibiting a lack of due care or concern
5799624 unquestionably it may be considered part of the general circumstances impacting an insureds objectively reasonable expectations as to the scope and extent of coverage under a policy
5799625 exclusion p provides contextual evidence for the phrase negligent publication within the affirmative coverage section of the aislic policy if there was no affirmative coverage for false advertising or misrepresentation in advertising then the policy would have no need for an exclusion specifying that those claims were not covered why recite that certain acts are expressly excluded from the policy if they were never covered in the first place
5799626 do not yield one clear definition of negligent publication should be seen as a limited set
5799627 i am unaware that sony missed any secret deadline after which a term may no longer be used in new judicial contexts and the possible usages for the term is closed to the conjunction of the ways in which it had thus far been used

5799636 the global economic downturn is affecting economies across the world and clearly scotland cannot be fully insulated from its effects
5799637 but there are two reasons why the economic outlook for scotland is positive
5799638 one of our highest priorities is taking action on housing in scotland that is why we have published the next steps for our housing policy and why up to 100 million capital spending will be brought forward to support these efforts and help us to meet demand for affordable housing
5799639 these actions will help more people across find new housing of the right kind in the right numbers in the right places the new development on castle dubh loan in pitlochry is a great example of high quality rented accommodation giving people homes to be proud of

5799740 the adult entertainment industry is doing their part and we are thrilled that tera and evan have volunteered their time in order to remind parents to do their part by utilizing parental filtering options
5799741 evan and i take doing our part in the industry seriously to make the web a safer place for children we really believe what we say in the psa it is not for appearances but we take it to heart certain sects of our society and our government have the adult industry under a microscope using it as a scapegoat for all things unholy we have a social responsibility to keep adult entertainment restricted to adults we are so honored to have been approached by asacp and to be included in such an important message stormy daniels is not only one of my peers but a friend and i am proud to stand along side her in the name of something as important as the rta label if we dont police ourselves someone else will

5799751 the story i got was that the son of one of the producers of mnf had my tape in his tape player the producer said what is that the truth is usually stranger than what you can make up and that is how it went down when it comes on for that 60 seconds it hits you right in the face and makes you go wow it really gets people in a good mood and pumped up and ready for the game it has been a wonderful ride i have had a lot of fun doing it and im going to have a lot more fun
