570040 theres an obligation on the environment agency to have to review these combined sewer overflows
570041 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now
570042 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
570043 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
570044 we have identified around 3 500 of these temporary consents but we operate on a risk basis and because most of these have not been identified as unsatisfactory and are low risk to water quality they are not a priority of ours
570045 intermediate i wasnt quite sure where to place the boundary between the last two maybe once students are able to engage in a short original conversation maybe we need finer levels talk 00 46 2 july 2008 utc
570046 it was the last thing on my mind which is usually what happens when you hit home runs
570047 youre not trying to youkilis tied it and to kind of come right back and get the lead after that first inning it was big it was a good all around night offensively
570048 we got a nice two run homer in the first that got us up and they struck back so quick with five straight hits
570049 evelands command in the strike zone just wasnt there when he did throw strikes they werent in the right locations and theres no doubt he struggled tonight
570050 this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
570051 tony blair continues to be 100 supportive of gordon brown and the government
570052 yeah and the new dailies are piss easy you can actually do 25 now so its really good for goldfarming well im not sure if ill continue playing i mean ive seen everyhing theres to be seen and i really have the best gear i can get now so maybe ill have a look on the other side you know
570053 oh im sorry i heard you guys talking about the new patch so i started listening
570054 what i play the game as well i was just curious on what server do you play
570055 well we are in this guild actually were quite decent cause were the 12th guild on our server we practically cleared everything
570056 uhm we wiped again on archimonde last night but tonight were going to give it another try thats mount hyjal you know
570057 lovely our guild is second on the alliance side and were at illidan stormrage at the moment
570058 i think pryor is going to be great at ohio state
570059 just to put him in the game shows you how good hes going to be his rating in the game shows you how much confidence everyone has in him
570060 im as anxious as everybody to see what its going to look like
570061 they didnt put tebow in to do the things leak can do
570062 they put tebow in to do things that maybe wasnt leaks nature you would think the same would be true if there were things that terrelle could do that perhaps todd doesnt do
570063 so i think that makes a lot of sense if there are some things that terrelle demonstrates he can add to the package that maybe arent todds strong suit then maybe you can find that mixture of everyones strengths
570064 my coaches were really good at developing packages for guys
570065 where you just get him five to 10 plays and those are the 10 plays he knows hes going to run and then he can get comfortable and confidence is just such a huge thing i would be very hesitant to put a guy in a compromising situation early in his career
570066 you have so much time to get ready to face an offense and if beanie wells is the primary focus and the power game and a quarterback that isnt very mobile thats your focus
570067 now all of a sudden you have to spend a certain amount of time on ok when they get to the red zone or when pryor comes in this is the defensive philosophy when we see no 2 back there this is the defense that were going to run
570068 it takes time away from your preparation to stop beanie wells and todd boeckman
570069 if he can adjust to the preparation and learn the defenses
570070 it does so much for you beyond just being fast
570071 and a thumpin good one id say once yehve been trained up a bit

570076 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
570077 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
570078 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
570079 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
570080 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

570087 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men

570117 this novel is not a literary masterpiece its value stands or falls on some of the provocative and interesting things it says about our relationship with god and it is in regard to its theology that i want to comment in this post i accept that this novel has gone through various revisions and rewrites and could be called a work in progress what i would suggest is that it needs considerable further theological refinement

570135 its always good to rule out a fracture but sprains can take some time too
570136 to deflect a ball that much to shortstop it had to have gotten a good piece of him that could have been bad we must be living right
570137 he understands what he needs to do in the box and if you dont get pitches in good zones hell put a good swing on them
570138 when he was young and had a little more velocity he still had great command with all his pitches thats why he was a perennial cy young award candidate
570139 right now hes adapted and learned what he needs to do with not quite as much fuzz but he still has that uncanny command and is able to change speeds and make pitches we didnt see many pitches over the heart of the plate
570140 hes not trying to attack you in the zone he wants to see how far youll go
570141 he showed that in my first at bat he threw four straight balls all real close he wanted to see where the strike zone was and if i was going to chase he lives on the corners
570142 if you sit back and let him dictate the count and use all his pitches youre going to be down 0 2 and 1 2 a lot
570143 a couple of them were on good pitches and they put good swings on them
570144 the one to betemit wasnt a bad pitch fastball on the outside corner and the one to a rod was right where i wanted it a heater away you have to tip your hat
570145 you try to put someone away you get ahead and they foul a bunch of pitches off
570146 hes trying to get early count outs and sometimes he does but a lot of times he has to work hard for outs i dont think it affects him inning to inning but i think it affects him as the game gets longer
570147 hes thrown a lot of pitches to each hitter not only might he tire a little earlier but these guys have seen a lot of pitches and there are only so many things you can do the third and fourth time around

570149 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
570150 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
570151 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
570152 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end

570156 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
570157 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
570158 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own

570160 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
570161 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
570162 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
570163 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
570164 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
570165 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
570166 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
570167 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
570168 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
570169 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
570170 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
570171 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
570172 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
570173 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
570174 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
570175 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
570176 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
570177 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
570178 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
570179 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
570180 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
570181 there was one phone call made to let me know manny was traded
570182 you bring your stuff back from boston im in l a already talk to me about today
570183 that was the one record i had and its gone now
570184 im a little disappointed about that he two upped me he couldnt go with no 98
570185 he cant just seem to relax when he gets in the game
570186 if i felt he wasnt trying to help himself i dont think i would have continued to try to make it work
570187 but he was in there working at it and we have two hitting coaches working with him practice stuff has been good unfortunately its not the same as the game
570188 in the sessions we have taught school teachers and principals about various security aspects which are to be implemented immediately and also the idea is to make them aware on any kind of terrorist activities and possible threats
570189 we are implementing the advisory issued by the police commissionerate and tightening security in and around schools in the wake of the ahmedabad serial blasts and bombs recovered from surat city
570190 the way security systems have been placed in schools like ours those should be implemented in schools all across to ensure that we dont lose lives in the hands of terrorists and we can fight their challenges
570191 she used to watch the reality show which had lots of impact on her
570192 even the warnings that come with the footage thats not very important because all teenagers all adolescents have this sense of invincibility about them so they just throw caution to air and they feel that if so and so can do it so can i

570217 but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google
570218 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist
570219 in any event plaintiffs live far from the desert and are far from hermits

570221 the response quotes and expands upon an existing legal opinion to help frame the response
570222 it should not be interpreted as a blanket statement on our views towards privacy

570237 pdf a brief overview of the changing structure of u s families children of lgbt parents the impact of bullying and anti lgbt name calling at schools and the early development of sexual orientation one of the biggest concerns that parents have when discussing lgbt issues is that it necessarily means talking about sex this is untrue even the very youngest children can be told that families come in many different types some have two moms or two dads some have one of each and some have only one parent or one plus a grandparent or any of various other permutations as children grow and learn the basics of biological reproduction they may naturally be curious about how two moms or two dads created their families the simple explanations in the family equality councils talking to children about our families pdf are aimed at pre teens but may also be useful for parents of teens looking for a place to start as children reach their teens and start thinking about dating and relationships they may indeed wonder about the more intimate aspects of lgbt relationships it may be necessary to discuss sex at this point but no more so than when discussing opposite sex relationships all teens regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity need to learn about safe sex as well as the emotional aspects of intimate relationships still teens may be just as curious about the non sexual aspects of lgbt life such as how same sex couples create their families the various terms used to describe lgbt people what various religions say about being gay and why lgbt issues create such controversy a short article like this is not the place to attempt comprehensive answers to these questions others have thankfully done so elsewhere what if someone i know is gay answers to questions about what it means to be gay and lesbian by eric marcus simon pulse 2007 is perhaps the best single volume resource for straight teens with gay classmates teens who may be questioning their own sexuality and teens dealing with a parents coming out the 2007 edition also boasts a new chapter just for parents both those with gay children and those who simply want to be able to explain gay issues to their kids the book is unfortunately brief on gender issues and the transgender community but it is nevertheless highly recommended as a first book on gay issues for parents and teens themselves beyond the golden rule a parents guide to preventing and responding to prejudice transgender
570238 shes a very tough opponent she proved that this week
570239 she beat some very good players but its another match i just want to focus on myself playing my game being aggressive and lets see whos going to be stronger sunday
570240 its still one match im so excited about this about my game and that im in the final of a tier i for the first time i will try to play my best sunday
570241 i feel like i belong in the top 20 and maybe i can still be better
570242 im really happy to be there because my goal for this year was to start in the top 50 and now i will get to the top 20 for me its like a dream
570243 shes playing like the number one player in the world
570244 if i would be like top five i would have maybe 200 points between us but its still a big difference in the points at the moment im not focusing on that because its still really far away if it will get closer then i might think about it
570245 it really helped me that it started raining because i was able to go in the locker room and talk to my coach
570246 it wasnt easy to talk to my coach because he was really mad then i realized that if i start to play my game to put more pressure on her to step in the court then i have a chance to play against her and to win this match
570247 do you think its fair to change a semifinal when you already played one set on it and it goes to another court
570248 exactly thats not fair we played on court 1 for me thats not fair
570249 there are no calories so you can eat all you want
570250 we both love sauerkraut and we decided we ought to come up here and be with other people that love sauerkraut
570251 and she has eaten it right out of the can
570252 weve been here since noon and weve been eating our way from one end to the other
570253 it tastes good and i can eat it while im decorating you can turn it into sauerkraut you can have cabbage soup im actually eating cabbage ice cream right now
570254 youd be surprised how many people come back to visit their friends you might call it phelps old home weekend
570255 it really brings family and friends together its a perfect event for a small town like phelps
570256 this year alone since january we have recorded 35 major incidents of atrocities against the christian community
570257 when we talk of major incidents we do not count minor incidents like cases of harassment beatings attacks on church halls and filing false cases against christian workers
570258 the bjp which is used to segregating masses on religious lines and attacking minorities even physically will do so even more and would like to show hindus that they are the only saviors of hinduism and that if they do not protect the hindus they will all become christians or muslims
570259 are a technique to polarize the votes they bjp and affiliates want to threaten the hindu community that christians are going ahead of them
570260 the bjp thinks that by doing this they can consolidate the hindu votes which is not true
570261 the life of christians has become miserable at the hands of miscreants in connivance with the police
570262 there are allegations that when atrocities were committed on christians the police remained mere spectators and in certain cases they did not even register their complaints

570280 i was very shocked by your remark of casual i thought that means for you i am a kind of existence what you called casual
570281 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
570282 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
570283 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
570284 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who should be replaced and who should be appointed to which position
570285 in america they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
570286 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
570287 holbrooke strongly promised me that the hague tribunal would be history for karadzic if he withrdrew from politics forever
570288 hiv develops resistance very rapidly and once that happens drugs dont work as well as they theoretically should or they stop working altogether
570289 physicians routinely have the patients virus tested for resistance in advance of treatment to help make the appropriate clinical decisions
570290 the focus has been on specific areas of the hiv genome where we expect these resistance conferring mutations to occur
570291 we focus on a particular sequence on an important gene from amino acid 1 to 300 and as such we miss roughly a third of this gene until recently most researchers believed that this hidden area was of little clinical significance
570292 the mechanism about how these mutations could be involved in resistance was not clear however in our paper we present data that explains in considerable detail how these mutations work
570293 its extremely time consuming and expensive to validate genotype testing
570294 however we probably will be testing these areas in a couple of years
570295 it was mind boggling because it went completely against what we had expected to see happening
570296 once we figured out what was happening however the results were very clear
570297 in the past many believed that cell specialization or differentiation was a terminal state there was no going back or getting young again
570298 but now not only do we know this reversion happens naturally we also have a very tractable genetic system in which to study it
570299 i had about four different hypotheses to explain why i couldnt see any of these cells crossing the dorsal trunk
570300 it took quite a while to convince ourselves what was truly going on
570301 to find two very different kinds of progenitor cells in a single fruit fly tissue raises the possibility that there may be more than one kind of adult stem cell in mammalian tissue
570302 it may be that organisms use both quiescent undifferentiated cells and more highly differentiated yet reversible facultative stem cells under different conditions
570303 although it wasnt expected drosophila have clearly taken advantage of this biological capacity during metamorphosis
570304 the stem cell community is debating whether every mammalian tissue relies on conventional adult stem cells of the sort already identified in bone marrow and muscle or if instead there are facultative stem cells that can arise from differentiated cells within the tissue now we know that it doesnt necessarily have to be one or the other it could be both

570307 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely that others to become infected with hiv
570308 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection
570309 that may be because women in high risk groups have a greater risk of acquiring hiv from causes other than bv this could be helpful information in identifying which populations would be helped most through targeted bacterial vaginosis control measures
570310 geological maps are essential tools in finding natural resources e g water hydrocarbons and minerals and when planning to mitigate geohazards e g earthquakes volcanoes and radon natural resources are a crucial source of wealth for all nations especially those that need to develop and build their economies identifying geohazards is often a matter of life or death other challenges facing all nations in the 21st century include rising sea levels management of waste nuclear or domestic and storage of carbon knowledge of the rocks that we all live on has become increasingly important and sharing that knowledge at a time of global environmental change is crucial
570311 today you can go to the onegeology website and get geological maps from across the globe from an overview of our entire planet to larger scale maps of the rocks of individual nations you also have the ability to hop from this web site to higher resolution applied maps and data on linked national web sites participating nations are contributing to a legacy for humankind by acting locally they are thinking globally
570312 it is known that ports are contaminated what we are investigating is to what extent the contaminants therein reach aquatic organisms
570313 we take mussels from clean waters and place them at points we wish to analyse in order to see how much and what kind of contamination is accumulated
570314 the galician biologists are in charge of studying the consequences of the contaminants on the mussels we measure the concentration of the contaminants received by the mussels
570315 today tbt is banned but it is highly durable and it can still be found in waters
570316 these last are similar to dioxines and in the past were used in very powerful transformers they are also prohibited but are still present in the water
570317 we place 20 or 30 mussels mounted on plastic supports and inside gauzes and submerge them at a depth of two metres
570318 after a certain period we collect them for analysis of level and type of contamination accumulated
570319 in some cases the contamination is high and the mussels can die
570320 by using polymeric mountings we simulate chemically what the mussels do i e accumulate contaminants
570321 the situation in the port of bilbao is quite homogenous we have taken samples in the areas of getxo santurce and the exterior port bilbao in the basque country and the results are similar in each case on the other hand in vigo galicia we detected wide differences from one zone to another for example between water near a shipyard and the open sea
570322 we wish to know if our methodology and the sampling tools that we have developed are useful for this purpose
570323 on the one hand we have seen that zones supposedly clean are not as clean as we thought it is necessary to redefine the selection of these clean zones on the other we are also perfecting the tool that chemically simulates the role of the mussels in order to carry out even more precise sampling
570324 in the past we were constrained by the time lapse between the completion of exercise and capturing the images
570325 we now have the ability to exercise patients to peak stress and obtain a high definition image of their heart within 60 seconds which helps us more accurately identify exercise induced abnormalities osu medical center is the only place in the world performing treadmill exercise stress tests inside the mri scan room
570326 cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the united states and by combining our medical expertise with other disciplines we can develop safe approaches for improved diagnosis and treatment
570327 while current forms of stress testing have been helpful combining exercise stress with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging allows us to better measure the presence and extent of heart disease with a clarity not previously possible
570328 by combining the physiological or functional images of the blood gt
570329 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
570330 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
570331 the room had to be dark for the good reason that a sharp image requires a small pinhole but a small pinhole also produces a dim image
570332 to get a brighter image without lenses you have to use many pinholes the problem then becomes how to assemble the information including depth information from the overlapping shadow images this is where coded apertures come in
570333 what would happen if we put a ura right next to an object we were imaging with the x ray beamline it should allow us to create a holographic image one with orders of magnitude more intensity than a standard hologram
570334 imaging with coherent x rays will be a key technique for developing nanoscience and nanotechnology and massively parallel holography will be an enabling tool in this quest
570335 the same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia so it is able to breathe oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic
570336 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
570337 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
570338 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
570339 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell
570340 the important point to stress is that the team has come up with an alternative fuel cell design that is more economical more easily sourced outlasts platinum cells and is just as effective
570341 tnfaip3 can be thought of as a critical brake mechanism for the immune system
570342 when the gene doesnt function properly the immune system redlines
570343 we suspect that the variant either doesnt make enough of the protein or it makes a less effective protein
570344 our data adds tnfaip3 to a growing list of lupus associated genes that may help us diagnose and treat our patients
570345 every single lupus associated gene we discover is just as important as the others
570346 each gene can set off new opportunities and new projects for us you never know which gene is going to give you the best chance to develop new therapeutics or better diagnostics
570347 we also want to know exactly what effect the gene variation has on a20 protein production and function
570348 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult in addition the reluctance to inform patients of the limited survival gain of palliative chemotherapy may be motivated by a desire to protect patients from bad news
570349 however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
570350 there is currently no effective medical treatment for children with the most common type of congenital hyperinsulinism
570351 this type of congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by mutations in genes that encode important potassium channels in the pancreatic beta cells
570352 if this peptide can be developed into a treatment for children with this common form of hi we may have a new tool for controlling their insulin levels and managing their disease
570353 paper of gt insulin producing cells found in a variety of tissues in diabetes
570354 the transition from adolescence to adulthood has been shown to be a time for taking on many negative health behaviors including increases in smoking and alcohol use and decreases in physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption
570355 in this study we were investigating whether tv viewership and recognition of snack advertisements were associated with snack food consumption and the odds of being overweight or obese
570356 the link between how much a person snacks while watching tv was directly related to viewing food advertisements specifically when choosing to eat an energy dense snack
570357 the exposure to the advertising seems to stimulate a desire to eat that particular food product also sitting watching tv provides a prime opportunity to snack
570358 it appears that higher quality articles in other words more citable articles are simply made freely available
570359 previous studies using different methods simply got cause and effect reversed
570360 the established dogma is that freely available scientific articles are cited more because they are read more
570361 we found that open access publishing may reach more readers than subscription access publishing but there is no evidence that freely accessible articles are cited any more than subscription access articles
570362 there were definitely more article downloads for freely accessible articles
570363 yet nearly half of these downloads were by internet indexing robots like google crawling the web for free content
570364 there are many reasons to provide free access to the literature

570366 were playing russian roulette in some sense with these storms coming up the coast
570367 if we have a high tide or spring high tide when we have one of these events then were in trouble
570368 the vulnerability of the area speaks for itself as weve already had cases of flooding
570369 when coupled with sea level rise its not going to take much of a storm to cause flooding as we go into the coming decades so we are working to provide better forecasting of these events in the future
570370 in contrast to the accepted view the brain does use fat as fuel
570371 our study shows that the minute by minute control of appetite is regulated by free radicals implying that if you interfere with free radicals you may affect eating and satiety
570372 that each time a feeling of fullness or satiety is reached during a meal you may be chipping away some time from your maximum lifespan as the most free radicals are produced when satiety promoting brain cells are active
570373 the timing of taking antioxidants may be critical for the control of appetite
570374 if taken on an empty stomach antioxidants may further increase appetite however when taken with food they may affect satiety further studies are needed to determine whether any regiment of orally taken antioxidants could be used to control appetite in animals and humans

570430 probably leave rates unchanged and give a no bias statement
570431 we expect the ecb to be on hold for at least the next 12 months
570432 to the mounting evidence that the eurozone economic downturn is deepening
570433 the ecb will no longer describe the economic fundamentals as sound
570434 we expect the risk of a much sharper downturn in the labour market to keep the ecb on hold despite the current inflation overshoot
570435 we wouldnt say it very loud but there may be fair chances that julys 4 1 percent may have been the peak in inflation
570436 probably state that it is too early to deem as entrenched the recent downward movement in oil prices

570448 well the other day when you complained about me i complained about you to janet and i told her you shop at the 99 cent store
570449 you purchased one blouse from a department store that closed 20 years ago
570450 well then you dont care if i take back the four blouses i purchased for you at the 99 cent store
570451 well then i am going to take back the television set in your room i purchased the television for you let me see what you purchased today to see if they have any stains
570452 but i got mad because i felt like you were telling me what i purchased is not good
570453 i dont even know what you purchased i havent seen every thing you have so much
570454 look at the blouses sweaters blazers etc that i purchased at the 99 cent store i really cannot believe what great buys they are and all in good shape i mean some have minor stains but they can be washed out

570456 to minister in another province you must be properly invited and approved
570457 no hizo menci n ni a los cambios de funcionarios como guillermo moreno
570458 lamentablemente no se refiri o lo hizo someramente acerca de temas muy importantes como la inflaci n la grave situaci n por la que atraviesa la provincia de c rdoba los discursos del campo en la rural o la realidad de aerol neas argentinas

570462 la soberbia y las decisiones caprichosas solo nos mantendr n como pa s al margen de las posibilidades que el mundo nos ofrece hoy
570463 le resulta imposible plantear los actos de gobierno hacia el futuro
570464 sobre la soluci n de los verdaderos problemas de la gente como inflaci n inseguridad y la energ a no emite palabra
570465 me llam poderosamente la atenci n que nadie preguntara o que la presidenta omitiera hablar sobre el acto en la rural no se hizo una sola menci n al discurso de luciano miguens que fue contundente y que merec a al menos una menci n o consulta sobre que opinaba la presidenta
570466 creo que la conferencia la arm la presidenta para arrebatarle la tapa de los diarios al campo no fue seria no tuvo definiciones y es grave que haya ratificado que no va a haber cambios en su gabinete y en su pol tica de gobierno
570467 su actitud arrogante no es propia de un cuadro pol tico sino de alguien que no alcanza a percibir las preocupaciones de la gente
570468 est bien que acceda a la conferencia de prensa pero eso no deber a ser una excepci n sino una pr ctica democr tica corriente
570469 la presidenta no dio cuenta de los problemas centrales del pa s no habl de la inflaci n y defini que las acciones de moreno son sus acciones
570470 defendi lo hecho en el indec sin novedades en el gabinete sin novedades respecto a lo sucedido con el conflicto del campo sin novedades en relaci n a moreno y sin novedades respecto a la inflaci n que en realidad estuvo ausente de la conferencia
570471 destine tiempo a agenda abierta para responder a la prensa local e internacional
570472 decir que guillermo moreno es honesto y correcto es realmente burlarse del pa s que todos los d as sufre la inflaci n y ve las mentiras y las patotas en el indec

570474 this company can afford to provide workers a fair contract with decent benefits and to keep quality jobs in our communities

570478 we are fighting not just for union members but for working families everywhere
570479 we are fighting for the kind of jobs that are rapidly disappearing in america the jobs that pay living wages and good benefits jobs that allow our families to keep up jobs that pay taxes to support quality public education and important services jobs that make america work
570480 we are proud to stand with our verizon telecom brothers and sisters to demand a fair wages and benefits for all of us
570481 everyone agrees that americas health care system is in crisis
570482 but the answer isnt to shift even more health care costs to workers why wont verizon join us in efforts to win national reforms that would guarantee health care for all
570483 verizon management seems to want to bury their heads in the sand just three days from expiration theyre still looking for concessions that are simply unacceptable
570484 once again verizon needs to be reminded that its huge profits are only made because of our dedication to providing high quality and reliable service yes we are the network

570559 i know that most men including those at ease with problems of the greatest complexity can seldom accept the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as would oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions which they have proudly taught to others and which they have woven thread by thread into the fabrics of their life

570564 i want to prove i can get to 200 innings and go from there
570565 i would like to go out there and pitch the ninth inning every time
570566 but thats up to me i have to lower my pitch count i have those innings when i start a guy off 2 0 and still get him out thats not really efficient i need to throw strikes right off the bat i need to get guys out quicker
570567 im young theyre probably thinking they dont want to blow me out for the season
570568 if the outcome is good you say well it worked out just fine now we can do it all the time but theres too much stuff that can go on that would make it swing one way or another you cant beat yourself up over it there are so many things you cant control

570575 what i did was i went off and left my glasses and i cant see my words
570576 i can say this that all of the things that have happened for me and to me
570577 can i tell you today at the expense of sounding real self rightous i belong here i belong here i belong here i belong here because i know what to do with it i know what to do with gods fame with gods dollars with gods visibility gods influence and relationships i know what to do with it
570578 getting here did not come without controversy as im sure it did with some of the guys sitting behind me but through it all im here with a greater appreciation for something that not every player i able to achieve and for people who stood up for me and spoke out in my behalf im extremely honored to be iincluded with this group of elite athletes and to do so with the class of 2008 i will wear the banner with pride and i will represent it well thank you
570579 the last 43 years of my life involved with the nfl have taught me through faith hard work determination willingness to get somewhere to a better life i should have a chance to rise from the most modest circumstances and become a hall of famer just like this old undrafted free agent country boy from angleton texas

570581 pregnancy is a very natural part of life but for many women it can also be a very daunting and vulnerable time
570582 during a visit to charleville shortly after i became premier i heard first hand from mothers whod had to travel a long way from home to access pre and post birth support services
570583 i have also spoken to mothers who were treated by 16 different medical and midwifery staff during their pregnancy i recognise we need to do better for regional mums
570584 this is about delivering personal professional and local support to regional queensland mums and mums to be from the moment they conceive right through to the early weeks of motherhood
570585 they will have access to the same midwife or small team of midwives for every stage of pregnancy someone familiar to answer their questions and support them through this very emotional time
570586 they can stay close to home near family and loved ones
570587 it will also mean a much more personal touch in maternity care which can only deliver better outcomes for queensland mums and their babies
570588 we expect up to 600 mothers a year will benefit from the program across ipswich logan and charleville
570589 earlier in the year the talk around the football world was were not going to see bags any more because of the ability of players to flood back
570590 but what youre seeing in the modern game is most teams are now really trying to move the ball on quickly to beat those numbers pushing back into space and what its allowing is one on one isolation for some of our great forwards whether it be franklin or fevola or lloyd or brisbanes jonathan brown
570591 those guys are really difficult match ups one on one because theyve got leap and strength and smarts
570592 ive helped the team up the ground and endurance wise im not too bad ive probably never been able to use it
570593 my turnaround in form has coincided with the teams and when the teams going well it helps you as a forward
570594 to see a bloke whos played 14 years of footy fly so high it shows theres a little bit of ping left in his legs
570595 we got ourselves back in that situation which was good but thats when youve really got to tighten the screws even further and work even harder to ensure you can get a lead
570596 we almost got there and then we fell behind and had to play catch up for most of the day
570597 at the beginning of this congress i proudly gaveled the congress to order in the name of all of americas children
570598 today is a very special day in the history of the congress and for our families
570599 its important to note in 2007 consumers union dubbed that as the year of the recall
570600 and so when we sign this legislation to send to the president we will be doing so in the week we passed legislation to make college more affordable for americas families the medicare bill signed into law earlier for americas seniors and people with disabilities to have legislation passed last night under the leadership of congresswoman rosa delauro for equal pay
570601 so these issues were about the health the education the safety of americas families and their security and this bill is the crown jewel because it was so long in coming so absolutely necessary and i want to thank all the members of congress house and senate who made this possible
570602 just when the caterpillar thought the world was over it became a butterfly
570603 because i never thought we would have our very own
570604 eu falava para ele assim eu sei que voc n o mau perguntava sobre a fam lia dele
570605 meu marido tinha sa do para ir pagar uma conta no banco e eu estava com meu filho na areia brincando de fazer castelinho
570606 eu at pensei nossa este cara est fumando maconha aqui eu disse at para o meu filho que estava com medo
570607 ele sacou uma arma mandou os policiais virarem e me catou
570608 ele estava com a adrenalina a mil fiquei com muito medo
570609 os caras est o at de fuzil me cercando como eu vou sair daqui
570610 eu disse para ele isso mesmo fume um cigarro se acalme
570611 ele estava com a arma apontada para minha cabe a procurando um isqueiro no bolso ele viu que tinham muitos policiais a virou a arma para a cabe a dele e atirou
570612 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
570613 create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival of life
570614 if alinghi gets away with this it probably will signal the end of the americas cup as we know it
570615 this isnt just about patching up an event this potentially is going to be a really really important precedent for the future of the cup for many many years to come
570616 we think its very very clear that the challenger needs to be a real yacht club we think the deed is crystal clear on that any other interpretation of that is mistaken and is going to be disastrous for the cup
570617 maybe what they wanted to set up was the alinghi cup
570618 if you have an enormously one sided situation a one sided set of rules clearly i dont believe that events going to be around very long
570619 theres never been a good explanation of why we all of a sudden we have to go to a set of rules where the defending team has all this control over all these race officials and jury and umpires
570620 they get to set the schedule of when teams sail and when they dont and when they can race and when they cant and so forth
570621 i certainly wouldnt be recommending that we challenge under such a one sided set of rules
570622 he wants to win thats why hes won 15 in a row he just dug in and refused to let crazed go by hes one hell of a horse
570623 it dont matter if i die now i got it
570624 a subject had some sort of flammable liquid thrown on her she was set a fire and then ran out of the house house caught on fire shortly after that
570625 she exited the structure her clothing was on fire at the time she exited she came out the front door of the residence out to the street

570628 est satisfecho con la manera en el que el gobierno est llevando y por tanto acompa ando su negociaci n privada con las autoridades venezolanas
570629 esa reclamaci n no le servir a karadzic como hilo conductor de su propia defensa lo del supuesto trato con el antiguo mediador estadounidense en bosnia richard holbrooke es muy llamativo y medi tico pero nada m s lo que ha ocurrido es m s simple los acuerdos pol ticos han salido al encuentro de la justicia internacional porque la necesidad de no dejar impunes cr menes horrorosos ha calado por fin entre los estados y la opini n p blica de ah que los tribunales listos para afrontar este reto hayan reaccionado prestos
570630 le el acta de acusaci n contra charles taylor en junio de 2003 pero no acab en manos de la justicia hasta 2006 a el bashir presidente de sudan le ocurrir lo mismo la voluntad de entregarlo existe es el principio del principio de su final y lo que se busca es una f rmula diplom tica aceptable para trasladarlo a la corte penal internacional cpi lo saben la liga rabe y la uni n africana aunque hoy critiquen su entrega es m s creo que dentro de 5 a os estar en manos de los jueces y habr paz en sud n
570631 por eso hay que ser muy cuidadosos con acusaciones como la de genocidio
570632 hay estudios sobre el particular que describen la calma de algunos d as y la ira y los gritos de otros en el banquillo de los acusados ha sucedido desde el nazi goebbels al ejecutado presidente iraqu sadam hussein o bien al ex presidente serbio milosevic todos pasaron de un poder absoluto a ser anulados y no conciben lo que les ocurre
570633 los estados no deben olvidar que es un lugar de referencia y a la vez un foro complementario al juzgar s lo a los principales causantes de tragedias internacionales no sustituye a los poderes judiciales de los distintos estados
570634 por eso lo ideal para la comunidad internacional es que la cadena de culpables comparezca en lo posible ante jueces locales
570635 tanto siria como elementos pro sirios de los servicios secretos libaneses tuvieron que ver en el atentado
570636 ning n estado actual tiene bastante poder para garantizar la vida y libertad de sus ciudadanos si la propia comunidad internacional no respeta el imperio de la ley

570717 viewers first fell in love with what is familiar in the show muhannads arranged marriage the respect shown to elders the family all living together in one house

570807 my only complaint about robins latest is that now i want to hop a plane to england but combine a cup of earl grey tea and this charming story and youre halfway there another delightful tale about women helping women to live their lives to the fullest

570814 engaging whodunit series kickoff readers will enjoy bells talent for description and character development
570815 james scott bell has written himself into a niche that traditionally has been reserved for the likes of raymond chandler

570826 how about if you store me instead and give her back her suitcase youd get much more fun out of your suitcase
570827 its important not to become discouraged you have to keep at it
570828 epstein when children are very young they all express creativity but by the end of the first grade very few do so this is because of socialization they learn in school to stay on task and to stop daydreaming and asking silly questions as a result the expression of new ideas is largely shut down we end up leaving creative expression to the misfitsthe people who cant be socialized its a tragedy
570829 oh my god what a waste of time and money how will she survive
570830 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
570831 i think you have overpayed in terms of executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome on the board
570832 its been about 26 hours in the course of a 24 hour day
570833 my support and my wifes support is with this board and this management team
570834 the indictment comes out and based on my reading of this thing i found it necessary to proceed with termination and were doing the paperwork
570835 there is a personnel action that has been taken but because its a personnel action i cannot really comment any further until that personnel action is completed
570836 weve become a very good platform for the projection of bomber forces tanker forces intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance forces and if need be fighter forces from here
570837 die bedingungen sind hervorragend und das ist wichtig f r uns schlie lich befindet sich die mannschaft weiterhin in der vorbereitung auf die saison
570838 wir haben nicht so oft die gelegenheit gegen mannschaften mit diesem niveau zu spielen wir nehmen das turnier sehr ernst es ist eine tolle herausforderung f r uns
570839 ich w rde mir sehr w nschen dass wir real und juventus demn chst auch in pflichtspielen gegen berstehen
570840 ich nehme sehr aufmerksam zur kenntnis dass der parteivorstand den fall nun nicht mehr als provinzposse sondern als politikum sieht
570841 vielleicht wird das als chance genutzt rechtzeitig vor den bundestagswahlen die notwendige inhaltliche kl rung zu erreichen
570842 au erdem sind die agenda hasser in unserem landesverband so stark dass sich frau kraft nicht offen zu clement bekennen wollte
570843 mein fall geht vor ber aber ich hoffe sehr dass sich aus meinem fall eine inhaltliche kl rung des spd kurses entwickelt es geht dabei nicht um meine person sondern um die zukunft der spd
570844 wenn eine menge geld im raum st nde dann w re cvc sicher verlockt zu verkaufen aber das w re dann wohl das ende von bernie
570845 wenn jemand kaufen m chte dann h ngt das gesamte business von einem 78 j hrigen ab
570846 das ist bei gewerkschaftsfunktion ren leider nichts neues diejenigen die den moralischen zeigefinger am h chsten heben halten am ungeniertesten die hand auf damit verraten leute wie bsirske die anliegen der mitglieder die sie gew hlt haben
570847 bsirske agiert nach dem motto links reden rechts leben eigentlich m sste er jetzt zur cktreten er hat seine leute w hrend des arbeitskampfes im stich gelassen
570848 herr bsirske soll in der s dsee bleiben wenn er jetzt nicht zur cktritt sollten ihm die gewerkschafter den stuhl vor die t r setzen
570849 das verhalten ist unglaublich ich fordere herrn bsirske auf sein aufsichtsratsmandat bei lufthansa niederzulegen
570850 ich habe frank bsirske als jemanden kennengelernt der sich sehr f r die interessen seiner mitglieder eingesetzt hat er hat dabei immer seine pers nlichen interessen zur ckgestellt
570851 two may talk together under the same roof for many years yet never really meet and two others at first speech are old friends
570852 anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend but it requires a very fine nature to sympathise with a friends success
570853 in den zw lf jahren meiner t tigkeit hat es bisher immer eine fortf hrungsm glichkeit gegeben wenn ich ein noch funktionierendes unternehmen bekommen habe
570854 ich bin sicher dass wir auch bei hertie einiges retten k nnen wir sind noch am anfang des verfahrens aber ich vermute dass es mehr als die h lfte der h user sein wird
570855 rund die h lfte der h user hat vor einem jahr doch noch geld verdient doch die eigent mer haben nichts mehr unternommen um eine rettung zu erm glichen
570856 ich beneide niemanden um diese sanierungsaufgabe die rettung wird ausgesprochen schwierig hertie bietet in jeder warengruppe mittelma und berall sind die spezialisten besser das operative gesch ft f hrt ja offensichtlich seit langem nur verluste ein ich habe den eindruck dass die kunden solche kleinen warenh user wie hertie oder wehmeyer nicht mehr wollen
570857 das wird bei einem unternehmen dieser gr e mindestens drei monate dauern
570858 aber mit einer solchen miete kann man kein geld verdienen
570859 die geier werden so lange wie m glich ber hertie kreisen in der hoffnung dass es noch billiger wird
570860 er kam mit einem arm ins schneidwerk st tzte sich mit der anderen hand am rand ab rutschte ab und kam auch mit dem zweiten arm hinein
570861 thank you for calling the restaurant this is wildest dreams week so please leave your unrealistic request and we will definitely honor it
570862 were here giving away ice cream to remind you that god loves you have a nice day
570863 this is our simple way of saying that god loves you
570864 beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy
570865 its in our criminal justice system that everyone is innocent until theyre proven guilty but in all reality until you actually are proven your innocence you carry the scarlet letter of the accused
570866 we wanted to be scrupulously neutral and put the debates so voters come first in the way they are organized and produced and way they reach the people
570867 theres a sense a realization that were taking something off their plate they dont have to mess with
570868 they can go about the business of campaign fundraising and campaign appearances and we will take care of the details
570869 there was a lot of back and forth and the parties were playing the stations against each other a lot of negotiations that werent in the best interest of the voters
570870 we havent agreed to any formats or any details but because we know its such a broad coalition we trust they will organize very professional debates worthy of the voters
570871 i can stay later today since my partner will be taking the dog for a walk
570872 only files in the mobile applications folder will be moved to the trash
570873 the financial state of the government of guam is bleak
570874 there are a lot of bills that need to be addressed theres also some appointments
570875 what i have to tell you this morning is that weve been trying to address this with the senators since i delivered the state of the island address in february
570876 if you have a k under the gun raise to three times the big blind
570877 i forced them to concentrate substitute its chaotic for them a guy goes down you have to substitute its tough on the coaches thats good thats great work for us
570878 ive taken the rhythm out of the team the way i do it
570879 the idea was to get the fundamental work and get every situation all the mechanics of a game thats what i was trying to accomplish today
570880 im going to have a better feel when we play somebody else really
570881 were talking about the board structure it just doesnt work for the people of guam or the kids either it is a disservice at this time and we need to find something else to move ah
570882 the financial state of the government of guam is bleak
570883 its going to cost about 125 000 to do an islandwide election involving 53 precincts with 47 000 voters
570884 i just want to be able to keep us in games
570885 i dont want him to throw 125 pitches every time out
570886 when he came to take me out i wasnt surprised
570887 i dont know how to swing easy all i try to do is keep my head on the ball but thats the same with everybody if you keep your head on it youll hit it
570888 i just hope i can build on it my first five outings it was hard to realize i was pitching in the big leagues today it was more of a feeling that it was just a baseball game it was the first time i felt like that
570889 when we stopped the flips and dips our numbers went up
570890 if youre a jerk i dont want you in my club for every guy i throw out i get three who are glad theyre gone
570891 now that were much older we dont have to show off anymore
570892 the professionals we know how to do all the tricks without hurting someone and invading other peoples space
570893 but a bunch of amateurs doing all this crazy stuff they can hurt themselves
570894 ladies youve got stilettos and you could put a hole in someones foot
570895 so take itty bitty steps and exercise good floor craftsmanship its not about flash its about communicating with your partner
570896 you dont replace a hall of famer with one guy
570897 but you certainly can fill people in there and if everybody picks up the slack you can get the same result
570898 you can replace a guy like michael strahan but you cant just think justin tuck is going to replace him thats unfair to justin tuck michael is a hall of famer so everybodys going to have to step up their game
570899 what do you mean leaders who has been here the last three years
570900 alternate events as they come along during the year concerts a tractor pull whatever we have
570901 were going to try to incorporate as many of those ideas into the way we package this psl program to be as fan friendly as we can recognizing the nature of our fans and how long theyve been fans and where they sit
570902 were not going to be able to make everybody happy
570903 not like an animal in a cage that everyones come to see
570904 we had opportunities to do something stupid and we didnt do it
570905 it makes me sick looking at him at least he didnt wear his super bowl ring out here
570906 i told him i didnt know if id let him in here hes still got buddies over in new york
570907 you see these two gentlemen im so happy to have them on the team theyre capable of taking us where we have to go
570908 with any situation like this you really cant discuss it publicly
570909 resolved by tomorrow i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
570910 when hes healthy he doesnt throw picks that was not characteristic of chad pennington
570911 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
570912 he just opened up a little spot for me to touch the plate
570913 i went back and then the ball came out i saw the first guy and then i was on the ground
570914 but pence had already taken off he was pretty much in the dugout and theres no way for the umpire to see he was blocked the whole time
570915 unfortunately this game they judge you for that they criticize winning or losing a game thats the way it goes it happened in the past and theres nothing i can really do
570916 hes got two very good pitches and we kind of hung in there thats why its so important even when the team gets up three or four runs you have to stop the bleeding
570917 i was battling doing my job and trying to give the team a chance to win
570918 we took the lead and i was just protecting the lead hoping everything winds up the way everybody wants unfortunately that didnt happen
570919 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
570920 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
570921 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
570922 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
570923 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
570924 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
570925 what if mary had taken plan b after the lord filled her with his hot white sticky holy spirit
570926 thats tabloid trash theyre full of lies im here to talk about helping people
570927 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory
570928 will not have the opportunity to defend his good name
570929 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
570930 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
570931 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
570932 i freaked and i remembered what had happened in other cases
570933 the issue has been the footwear that people have been wearing
570934 i dont have any specific information but we have seen some indications that it is happening all over the world in malls and other airports and other buildings
570935 two thirds of the way down i heard pop pop snap what i realized was andrews toes breaking
570936 they are very safe for people to get on them but if you are wearing crocs stand in the center of the stair
570937 the fact that a small foot can get caught under that escalator skirt is a problem
570938 in hindsight parents shouldnt be taking their small kids on the escalator
570939 not when youre traveling with baggage and dont have hands free to watch your child
570940 it is a tremendous disappointment for us to be without her for the tournament
570941 there continues to be evidence of taliban and haqqani network involvement in the indian embassy bombing as well as the attempted assassination of afghan president hamid karzai
570942 you will find folks who will say there is significant penetration of the isi by terrorist elements and thats a serious concern
570943 but others are saying that certainly theres penetration but we dont think its top to bottom
570944 a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
570945 defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
570946 badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
570947 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
570948 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
570949 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
570950 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
570951 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
570952 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
570953 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
570954 a family member in another part of the house was alerted by the intrusion and saw the suspects confronting his family
570955 la bvc y la bvl se encuentran interesadas en explorar alternativas dirigidas a una posible integraci n de sus mercados de renta variable preservando las estructuras locales

570958 the figure is still quite impressive and i estimate this will rise substantially in the next few years
570959 i know victims find it unacceptable that in one part of new zealand a person found guilty of a serious crime gets a certain length of sentence while in another the sentence could be less
570960 a mattress can still feel comfortable even if it no longer provides you with the support that you need
570961 but we wanted to let you know that were spending your inheritance
570962 a lot of what you read about climate change peak oil or economic crisis focuses on the future
570963 the goal is to motivate you to action by describing what may happen i do some of that but over the last year or so ive found myself replacing the future tense with the present describing not what might happen but what is
570964 a big club like ours must rely first of all on youth development as we want to bring the core strength of the club through the youth system
570965 i recently met the chairman of a brazilian club who told me they are negotiating all their contracts down by 50 as the tv company cannot pay the money all over the world tv money has gone short and there will be consequences on football
570966 the change we have seen over the past 100 years will be nothing compared with what we will see over the next 20
570967 its an extraordinary time to be alive i feel really fortunate to be around
570968 we are requesting the media and the public for privacy
570969 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents
570970 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
570971 i was just a little bit off missing fairways by four or five yards and then i missed it big on 11 and 13 i was getting misaligned in my set up and it was affecting my swing
570972 my alignment was just not quite square to the target i had been swinging great this week but if youre misaligned youve got to make a compensation
570973 it could have been a better round but youve got to take what it gives you
570974 a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference but i made a few as well so that kind of evens it out i played solid today and if i can do that tomorrow i think i have a chance
570975 i hit a couple of poor iron shots but other than that i gave myself a pretty pain free day under quite testing conditions
570976 there are no other international markets that need to be addressed in this manner
570977 i think what weve seen is that australia has a very sophisticated coffee culture
570978 people come in our cafe because they know us and they know theyll get good coffee were part of the local community
570979 starbucks is a mcdonalds coffee experience its not about the quality of the coffee its about convenience and location
570980 a few years ago there werent that many of them and they seemed to be going ok but then all of a sudden they were everywhere
570981 some city blocks had three starbucks on them its crazy
570982 what we do isnt rocket science im the first to admit that but youve got to have a passion for coffee that involves everything from grinding the beans to operating the machine
570983 you go into starbucks and its full of teenagers behind the counter id question whether they have that passion
570984 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
570985 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections
570986 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
570987 difficult to negotiate an accord when unemployment is on the rise and the economy is weakening
570988 a 40 percent decline in price would have put most developing countries into bankruptcy the issue was one of very survival
570989 i hope that if obama gets elected there will be a new commitment to multilateralism
570990 i hope that obama will realise how important multilateralism is and will resume the talks on a more reasonable basis
570991 by having a lot of issues raised in the same forum it is easier to find a compromise
570992 the agreements already in place protect against the most serious problems
570993 i think its great to get as high as that
570994 at the beginning of the year a lot of people were asking me if my new setup after splitting with coach brad gilbert was going to work and questioning if it was the right thing for me to do
570995 i think my results showed that it took a little bit of time but that its paying off and im enjoying myself much more on court
570996 im much calmer and obviously my results have got better and better as the years gone on
570997 hes obviously got a great serve but ive read it well in the past today i did the same
570998 youve still got to come up with passes because he volleys well
570999 i hit some great lobs and passing shots which is why i managed to break him so many times four
571000 i think the fed is going to stand on the sidelines holding at 2 0 percent were getting a very mixed economic picture right now
571001 i think the housing market is really the central element of this crisis
571002 the fed will do nothing next week fed will keep fed funds at 2 0 percent voice its concern about the longer term inflation threats from commodity prices

571008 suffering is the single greatest challenge to the christian faith
571009 we sent out virtually thousands of surveys were collecting that information back we will have seat licenses
571010 i think youll see the way the financing arrangements are the way the seats are allocated and priority those kinds of issues will be dealt with
571011 weve been supporting them for years but they probably just dont care
571012 if i couldnt afford it i would go a lot less
571013 i feel pretty good about coming out with something that is reflective of those values and those interests but were not going to be able to make everyone happy and thats something im disappointed about
571014 the cost of building the stadium is the same for both of us
571015 the fact the giants won the super bowl and we were 4 12 is just one of those things that happens in football were committed to building a championship team we dont hold back on anything
571016 pointing out that the secretariat will build housing complexes in parallel with the acquisition of several sectors equal to the number of housing units that have been completed to determine the value where the housing unit the value of the property yet been appropriated by the judiciary and by special laws including the acquisition required by the powers granted to the secretariat of baghdad and finally the citizen yet been appropriated compensation in the amount of time between acquisition aotzlimh housing units with pre determined price of the home price difference if there were increased and the amount remaining installment of a citizen if there was a shortfall in funds
571017 despite the failure to reach full consensus on the issue but it seemed obvious convergence of views
571018 ya pas de chaine hd parce que ya pas de tele hd ya pas de tele hd parce que ya pas de chaine hd
571019 the first irregularity i would mention is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
571020 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself

571024 authorities are bolstering subway security checks to ensure security during the gong wai yun read olympics in order to avoid congestion caused by security checks relevant officials have urged the public not to wear clothes when taking the subway a reporter asked whether the measure would cause inconvenience to the public questioning why such a strict measure was being introduced a gongwaiyun spokesmen acknowledged that this would cause the public to feel inconvenienced but pointed out that the during the 2008 beijing olympic period authorities already have been urging the public not to carry bags when taking the subway the spokesman noted that it is commonplace as well as necessary for the public to carry bags when they go out since the beijing olympics can still urge the public not to carry bags there is also nothing wrong with urging them not to wear clothes the spokesman also pointed out that not carrying bags would in reality not resolve issues of security it is entirely possibly for terrorists to conceal bombs in the crotch of their pants so in order to ensure that the gongwaiyun is 100 percent safe it is only proper for the public to sacrifice some convenience its a noble act accommodate the gongwaiyun

571034 i bear witness that muhammad is the messenger of almighty allah
571035 i was aware yesterday about an incident at a pool party that there was an accusation that it involved football players
571036 throughout his nhl career pavol has proven himself to be an offensive contributor wherever he has played
571037 pavol is a strong two way hockey player with excellent quickness and finish his play making abilities will be an asset on our power play and make him a great addition to our top six forwards
571038 because allan has had the experience if the receiver is open i want him to hit him
571039 because of the offense we run we ask the quarterback to manage the game well so if youve got a third and 8 throw and he is open you need to make the throw

571042 jaromir signed a letter of intent with the avangard omsk hockey team of the russian chl on or about 3am est this morning i wont comment on the terms of the agreement at this time it was a very difficult but personal decision to make in light of the many nhl teams interested in his services he is grateful to the nhl and especially the rangers in recent years
571043 they have a responsibility to coach to make kyle a better player and they were not doing that
571044 okposo just wasnt getting better bottom line and to me thats the frustrating part we entrusted the coach there to turn him into a better hockey player and it wasnt happening we feel more comfortable in him developing right under our watch
571045 whether it was kyle or another player until things change in that program wed probably make the same decision
571046 there should be a coach there that looks in the mirror i dont think wed be at this point if he was being coached properly
571047 there were three people that took shots against our organization against kyle and i wasnt going to sit idly by
571048 every situation is different were happy we got a good hockey player and we support ness getting his degree at the university of minnesota
571049 first and foremost anyone who takes a shot at our players our organization theres going to be a shot going back so thats what happened
571050 there were three people who took shots at our organization took a shot against kyle and im not going to sit idly by
571051 i told the truth people in glass houses shouldnt throw stones
571052 probably if we had it to do over again there were some things that wouldnt have been said
571053 you live and learn the thing is kyle got to play for the islanders and that was great for him and were looking forward to having aaron in the program hes a great kid from a great family
571054 im sure they have people watching all their prospects and we hope this time around we can have a good dialogue im looking forward to having a good relationship with them
571055 whenever the islanders feel im ready and i feel im ready lets go but ill take that when it comes as of now im going to the u so ill just concentrate on that
571056 he loves minnesota and loves living there but were looking elsewhere because i think he wants to get a different life experience explore a different part of the country and grow and mature and experience new things

571059 from the first moment doug called to the moment he offered the job i felt comfortable i think the sharks have done a tremendous job you dont get that close to 50 wins for a number of years in a row without a lot of talent its a matter of getting over the hump there are some real parallels between the wings and the sharks
571060 we are not making a judgment in regards to victorias secret
571061 we just dont feel it is in our institutions best interest right now

571079 let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church

571097 a man asked the prophet muhammad sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam whom should i honor most
571098 and every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonours her head it is just as though her head were shaved if a woman does not cover her head she should have her hair cut off and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or shaved off she should cover her head a man ought not to cover his head since he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of man for man did not come from woman but woman from man neither was man created for woman but woman for man for this reason and because of the angels the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head

571100 judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god with her head uncovered

571107 jaga kondisi kesehatan agar badan tetap fit dalam menjalankan ibadah
571108 thats like asking if i see positive sides to nazism communism catholicism of course islam preaches generosity and kindness and taking care of the poor and elderly and so on but these values arent limited to islam
571109 1 800 years before christ so it was way before islam came about
571110 if you look at the countries that practice it today
571111 most of them are islamic and one of the things that makes female genital mutilation very useful for muslims is their attitude towards virginity and premarital sex the quran is very clear and says those who engage in premarital sex should be flogged 100 times both men and but it is of course much easier to prove that a woman has had premarital sex islam like some of the other monotheistic faiths tries to control the sexuality of the woman first
571112 today in the world we live in slavery is practiced only in arab islamic world muslims are not responding to that
571113 more than 200 000 women trafficked globally are smuggled out of central and eastern europe and the former soviet republics each year the bulk of whom end up working as enslaved prostitutes almost half are transported to western europe roughly a quarter ends up in the united states
571114 for empirical evidence on whether and or the islamic world is in a crisis i would like to refer tony a caller to the show to the arab human development report in which the writers of that report say the arab islamic world is retarded when it comes to three factors the freedom of the individual knowledge and the subjugation of
571115 i know that western societies have had a terrible past from the burning of as witches all the way to what happened in the second world war thats one part of the west but theres the other part which is really developing institutions that safeguard the life and freedoms of the individual and it would be a huge pity to confuse the two and to you know lump them together and describe the west only as a source of evil
571116 the clash we are witnessing around the world is not a clash of religions or a clash of civilizations
571117 it is a clash between freedom and oppression between democracy and dictatorship it is a clash between human rights on the one hand and the violation of these rights on other hand it is a clash between those who treat like beasts and those who treat them like human beings
571118 i didnt question islam seriously until after 9 11 bin laden defined the world into muslims and non muslims and these had to either be converted or killed i asked myself where i stood after i saw the pictures of people jumping out of the world trade center
571119 as a muslim i had to ask if i agreed with that i was saddened to see bin ladens citations were from the koran and were consistent with the islam i grew up with
571120 it is just that we were passive until then now we had to take sides i had completed a political science degree and could no longer use ignorance as an excuse i had to make my own path
571121 at that point i lost my trust in their god and began to question all our teaching it was the turning point of my life and it has led me to this present point i had to leave i had to look for another god
571122 the whole idea is for 1 2 1 5 billion people living in the world to start thinking
571123 i wish people had been nicer to her but i dont blame islam i blame really messed up people whove used religion to justify their misogyny
571124 verily god will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves
571125 this film began not as a critique of islam but as a quest for the beauty in islam i soon realized that to find the beauty of my faith i needed to have basic questions addressed is the problem religion itself or the manipulation of religion
571126 verily allah is hayaa modest bashful amp sitteer i e the one who shields from disobedient acts he loves hayaa i e he loves for one to practice modesty and bashfulness and siter shielding covering
571127 any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husbands home to show off for unlawful purposes has broken allahs shield upon her
571128 al hayaa modesty amp bashfulness is from imam belief and imam is in al jannah the paradise
571129 hayaa modesty and bashfulness and imam belief are fully associated together if one is lifted the other follows suit
571130 i used to enter the room where the messenger of allah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam and my father abu bakr were later buried in without having my garment on me saying it is only my husband and my father but when umar ibn al khattab ra was later buried in the same place i did not enter the room except that i had my garment on being shy from umar
571131 good according the conditions of imaam bukhari and imaam muslim
571132 verily during the worldly life those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed and whenever they passed by them used to wink one to another in mockery and when they returned to their own people they would return jesting and when they saw them they said verily these have indeed gone astray but they disbelievers sinners had not been sent as watchers over them the believers but on this day the day of resurrection those who believe will laugh at the disbelievers on high thrones looking at all things are not the disbelievers paid fully for what they used to do
571133 islam began as something strange and it would revert to its old position of being strange so good tidings for the strangers
571134 and stay in your houses and do not display yourselves at tabarooj like that of the times of ignorance
571135 the best of your women is the affectionate the fertile in productivity the propitious favorable the consultative if they fear allah the most evil of your women are the mutabarrijat those who do at tabarooj the mutakhayelat who strut swagger and they are the hypocrites those who enter al jannah the paradise are like the cough crow
571136 of the people of hell there are two types whom i have never seen the one possessing whips like the tail of an ox and they flog people with them the second one women who would be naked in spite of their being dressed who are seduced to wrong paths and seduce others their hair is high like the humps of camels these women would not get into al jannah the paradise and they would not perceive its odor although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such a distance
571137 a woman whose mind speech and body are kept in subjection acquires high renown in this world and in the next the same abode with her husband
571138 athenian women were always minors subject to some male to their father to their brother or to some of their male kin
571139 she was obliged to submit to the wishes of her parents and receive from them her husband and her lord even though he were stranger to her
571140 a babe a minor a ward a person incapable of doing or acting anything according to her own individual taste a person continually under the tutelage and guardianship of her husband
571141 by a series of acts starting with the married womens property act in 1870 amended in 1882 and 1887 married women achieved the right to own property and to enter contracts on a par with spinsters widows and divorcees
571142 no society which preserves any tincture of christian institutions is likely to restore to married women the personal liberty conferred on them by the middle roman law
571143 to betroth a wife to oneself meant simply to acquire possession of her by payment of the purchase money the betrothed is a girl for whom the purchase money has been paid
571144 the girls consent is unnecessary and the need for it is nowhere suggested in the law
571145 the woman being mans property his right to divorce her follows as a matter of course
571146 in the mosaic law divorce was a privilege of the husband only
571147 o mankind keep your duty to your lord who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate of same kind and from them twain has spread a multitude of men and women
571148 it is believed that there is no text old or new that deals with the humanity of the woman from all aspects with such amazing brevity eloquence depth and originality as this divine decree
571149 every soul will be held in pledge for its deeds
571150 and when the female infant buried alive is questioned for what crime she was killed
571151 and among his signs is this that he created mates for you from yourselves that you may find rest peace of mind in them and he ordained between you love and mercy lo herein indeed are signs for people who reflect
571152 actually i accept this marriage but i wanted to let women know that parents have no right to force a husband on them
571153 and they women have rights similar to those of men over them and men are a degree above them
571154 if they husband wife desire to wean the child by mutual consent and after consultation there is no blame on them
571155 but consort with them in kindness for if you hate them it may happen that you hate a thing wherein god has placed much good
571156 and we have enjoined upon man to be good to his parents his mother bears him in weakness upon weakness
571157 your lord has decreed that you worship none save him and that you be kind to your parents
571158 it is the generous in character who is good to women and it is the wicked who insults them
571159 unto men of the family belongs a share of that which parents and near kindred leave and unto women a share of that which parents and near kindred leave whether it be a little or much a determinate share

571161 the pentagons minerva research initiative named after the roman goddess of wisdom and warriors will fund social science research deemed crucial to national security
571162 hey lookie i have 25 iberian blood in me with a portuguese ancestor on my grandpas side
571163 yup very native american short motherfucker comin through outta the way
571164 why do you keep giving in to him when im ready to leave i make my child go crying or not
571165 a couple of years ago jacobs older brother was lost in an accident and i would give anything for just 5 more minutes with him
571166 what the hell goes on at these fiber festivals anyway maybe we should look into this
571167 we think the new design is a great start but theres more to come with lots of interesting directions that well be exploring in our next releases of the home page
571168 to ensure that users can start a search immediately our base page loads first with the images and hotspots loading quickly afterward
571169 i would not leave this earth until god promised me that my hands could always touch the face of anyone who suffered
571170 mmmm no but i wanna be in an abba cover band
571171 well youve congratulations on this milestone many good things lie ahead no doubt
571172 yeah im working on having a pig farm and writing about digital colonialism
571173 slogged the wilds of the everglades collecting cottonmouths and rattlers
571174 a total loss we scraped it off the lot and started over
571175 what if we could put you in the middle of a storm and make it your job to figure out how to make a safer house

571178 although men have higher incidence and mortality from all non sex specific forms of cancer than women the public face of cancer in our study was overwhelmingly female
571179 this imbalance in television reportage of cancer may be distorting political and community perceptions about which cancers are most prevalent and tractable and thereby deserving of government and community support research investment and individual vigilance
571180 for example breast cancer attracts unparalleled research funding from individuals and governments while other cancers causing more disability struggle to gain a fraction of such support
571181 due to todays action florida is a step closer to implementing a comprehensive energy policy
571182 this bill will protect our natural resources stimulate our economy and reduce our dependence on foreign oil
571183 this will allow them to work with their customers to get them to use less electricity which is not in the utilitys best interest financially because they lose revenue on it
571184 but in fact its the most immediate and direct way to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and imported oil
571185 theres no reasons to delay the adoption of the clean cars rule in florida
571186 it basically puts the whole process behind a couple of years if were going to meet gov crists climate change goals we need to be doing this
571187 its a very comprehensive energy package that covers an awful lot of things
571188 i think it will place florida really in the forefront of the nation in terms of dealing with energy efficiency
571189 well be at the table to help them structure that
571190 this bill moves florida from being at the back of the line to being closer to the front of the line in energy conservation
571191 get out there and act thats what im paying you for move say something and dont say anything stupid this film is expensive here have another slim jim
571192 when we serve others by heightening awareness the result is priceless
571193 its wonderful to see so many southern californians enjoying their saturday night in the great park
571194 we look forward to an amazing summer of free music and dance performances and encourage everyone to experience all the great park has to offer
571195 and when the mood is right a burlesque hoola hooping fire performer
571196 alienated classicists and romantic bohemians gypsy music opera klezmer and cabaret come ons mingle like emigres trading aliases at an after hours club its highly cultured with a guttersnipes knowing sneer
571197 ivers presentation was music with the kind of life and spirit that come together when talented artists from different backgrounds find the linkages that connect all forms of music no wonder the audience loved every minute
571198 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents
571199 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
571200 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
571201 suddenly there was this rattling sound and the escalator stopped and started descending so i fled upstairs
571202 we will expel all the persons of the south side staying in the mt kumgang tourist area we deem unnecessary
571203 we will take strong military counter actions against even the slightest hostile actions in the tourist resort in the area of mt kumgang and the area under the military control from now on
571204 traitor lee myung bak and other men in authority of the puppet government including those concerned of the ministry of unification are taking the lead in this campaign
571205 we may be using webcams and internet technologies but youre still trying to find that chemistry
571206 and if it isnt there you just move on to the next person
571207 if people decide they dont like someone they usually know within 30 seconds
571208 if you meet someone you like three minutes isnt long enough if you dont like them 30 seconds is too long
571209 if you see someone you like in real life you dont go up to them with your resume and compare you just talk
571210 i wanted to be a little ridiculous and put myself out there
571211 my mom said the more places you put your resume the better chance you have for finding a job i figured id do the same thing with dating
571212 eight to 10 percent of our users have been to real dating sites
571213 were more about meeting new friends not necessarily meeting new dates
571214 the dating stories are good to hear and weve got plenty of them
571215 what interest me are the stories that are unique to our platform where weve come up with a new way for people to extend their social network
571216 there are no other international markets that need to be addressed in this manner
571217 i think what weve seen is that australia has a very sophisticated coffee culture
571218 people come in our cafe because they know us and they know theyll get good coffee were part of the local community
571219 starbucks is a mcdonalds coffee experience its not about the quality of the coffee its about convenience and location
571220 a few years ago there werent that many of them and they seemed to be going ok but then all of a sudden they were everywhere
571221 some city blocks had three starbucks on them its crazy
571222 what we do isnt rocket science im the first to admit that but youve got to have a passion for coffee that involves everything from grinding the beans to operating the machine
571223 you go into starbucks and its full of teenagers behind the counter id question whether they have that passion
571224 i think the fed is going to stand on the sidelines holding at 2 0 percent were getting a very mixed economic picture right now
571225 i think the housing market is really the central element of this crisis
571226 the fed will do nothing next week fed will keep fed funds at 2 0 percent voice its concern about the longer term inflation threats from commodity prices
571227 in the minutes of its june meeting the fomc characterized the economic outlook as very uncertain and the appropriate path for interest rates as quite unclear arguably this foggy policy environment has only worsened in the intervening six weeks
571228 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
571229 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
571230 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
571231 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
571232 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
571233 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
571234 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
571235 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
571236 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
571237 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
571238 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
571239 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
571240 i look at it this way you dont have to have a heart condition to be a cardiologist and you dont have to be an alcoholic to work as a therapist
571241 the holy fathers theology of the body and other philosophical and theological works delve deeply into the divinity of sexual relations in marriage im just making these complex ideas more accessible to average catholics
571242 the workshops with father knotz really helped us to overcome our inhibitions and guilt regarding sex
571243 he really listens to couples and this is why i think he understands us so well
571244 its a novel approach which in my experience helps couples achieve greater intimacy so why not
571245 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
571246 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections
571247 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
571248 difficult to negotiate an accord when unemployment is on the rise and the economy is weakening
571249 a 40 percent decline in price would have put most developing countries into bankruptcy the issue was one of very survival
571250 i hope that if obama gets elected there will be a new commitment to multilateralism
571251 i hope that obama will realise how important multilateralism is and will resume the talks on a more reasonable basis
571252 by having a lot of issues raised in the same forum it is easier to find a compromise
571253 the agreements already in place protect against the most serious problems
571254 of course as a politician and with his term expiring next year he cannot not think about a general election
571255 i am working under the assumption that mr fukuda will of course be the one who will call the election
571256 i think fukuda picked aso to be secretary general with a view to transferring power before the lower house election if the cabinets popularity doesnt pick up
571257 orange esp re que liphone va enfin faire d coller la consommation de services internet mobiles
571258 it seems like too many goats for someone to have as pets
571259 im wondering if the owners make goat cheese or goats milk fudge and if so where i can buy some
571260 ive got a herd of 170 so if we were producing milk i would be the skinniest tiredest guy around
571261 there are quite a few people interested in small breeding herds around here and weve got some great pets to offer the community
571262 we sell some goats for meat too but i prefer the pet sales
571263 i get calls all the time but i have to tell people i cant help them
571264 those are critical field and unit command positions theres a level of experience that you get from having to make those decisions
571265 were thinking outside the box and doing some innovative things
571266 this is the first time in my life that i have felt i am actually doing something about what the democrats have done in the past and are doing now to black people
571267 if the democrats had left us alone after the republicans freed us from slavery we wouldnt be having this discussion today they are keeping blacks in virtual slavery
571268 obviously we werent consulted before she decided to do any of this
571269 its a fruitless debate and it may conjure up more ill will toward the party we should be spending money on debating the democrats on the issues
571270 look beyond barack obamas skin color and soaring rhetoric and see an arrogant elitist millionaire
571271 mrs rice has some very strong views on certain issues
571272 it showed us that before we donate to anything regardless of how it appears the party needs to ensure it takes a look at all the content
571273 were used to american missionary teams coming to help us in mexico
571274 this is a load of bs a bunch of feel good jargon this will never work for me
571275 we are thrilled to announce that weve been acquired by google and will soon be joining the youtube team aligning us with the market leaders in online video together well apply what weve learned about the space and well work to develop innovative products and features for the youtube community we believe weve only scratched the surface in terms of whats possible with online video and we are really looking forward to taking the video viewing and creating experience to the next level
571276 average white voter who is clinging to their guns and bibles

571418 klopt het is wel fijn dat ik nog steeds niet over de datum ben ik wil er graag nog jaren aan vastplakken al vanaf mijn vijfde deed ik commercials en modellenwerk de keuze was snel gemaakt toen ik na de havo moest kiezen tussen de toneelschool en acteren in goudkust ik ging voor de praktijk en koos voor het laatste nooit spijt van gehad
571419 spijt is vooral zonde van de energie en tijd en je moet niet denken dat ik niks heb geleerd ik heb nu wel praktijkervaring en in de weekenden doe ik vaak spelworkshops acteren is gewoon het ultieme voor mij dat begrepen mijn ouders al snel zij hebben me gelukkig volop gesteund toen ik meteen ging werken
571420 acteren is een uitlaatklep op de een of andere manier moet dat hysterische eruit heb ik het nodig om me te laten gaan en me voor 100 procent te geven we hebben verder geen acteurs in de familie of zo maar mijn ouders zijn allebei heel creatief ik blijf altijd optimistisch en daardoor is alles veel minder zwaar dat was ook te merken met dancing with the stars al trainde ik me helemaal suf deed alles pijn en zag ik mijn vrienden een poos niet mij hoor je nooit klagen
571421 ik was een kneus als het om dansen gaat in de sportschool vond ik de pasjes van steps al vreselijk ingewikkeld daarom heb ik mezelf serieus afgevraagd ga ik nu schijterig weigeren of spring ik in het diepe dan maar onderuit dacht ik maar het ging eigenlijk heel goed
571422 ja dat hoorde ik vaak en nee we deden het niet met elkaar met remco heb ik er echt een vriend bij en mijn vriend jeroen vindt dat prima we hebben ook met zijn drie n veel lol jeroen en ik begrijpen heel goed waar de ander mee bezig is we belemmeren elkaar niet vertrouwen elkaar volledig momenteel zoeken we dus ook een huis samen
571423 klopt ik heb in de loop der jaren veel vrienden zien vertrekken zoals fajah lourens victoria koblenko bas muijs en winston post dat is niet leuk maar ik heb er nooit aan gedacht om dan zelf ook maar te vertrekken de rol van charlie is uitdagend en gevarie rd genoeg om het nog een hele tijd uit te houden na goudkust heb ik een half jaar geen rol gehad ik zat thuis en ik dacht dat ik knettergek werd dus ben ik maar weer op zoek gegaan en gaan leuren met mezelf bij castingbureaus haha ik word heel ongelukkig als ik niet acteer s ochtends vroeg een sc ne doen waarin je moeder overlijdt is vreselijk zwaar maar het geeft een enorme kick als het lukt
571424 natuurlijk het lijkt me ook geweldig om nog ns te spelen in een mooie dramaserie ik was vroeger een fan van westenwind bijvoorbeeld en nu lijkt rozengeur en wodka lime me super presenteren of zingen is ook mooi soms zeggen mensen wel eens dat ik eens wat meer met mijn stem zou moeten doen toch blijft acteren mijn grote passie
571425 dat vind ik dus echt een vreselijk neerbuigend woord je leest vaak dat er weer een blik soapies was opengetrokken ik schaar me daar niet onder alsof ik niet me op mijn vak zou concentreren en niet keihard werk voor gtst nemen we in twintig minuten een sc ne op waar anderen een dag voor uittrekken daar kun je natuurlijk over zeggen wat je wilt maar doe het maar eens zou ik worden afgewezen omdat ik een soaphoofd heb dan hoeft het voor mij al niet meer bekrompen gelukkig hoor ik juist vaak dat ik word gewaardeerd om mijn spel ik voel me dus ook he le maal niet minder
571426 eu gostaria de casar no templo no dia 30 de junho mas minha m e estaria l pelo menos agora minha m e est aqui
571427 hoje ao mesmo tempo o pior e o melhor dia da minha vida
571428 kijk die kerels hebben allemaal een piercing door hun tepel
571429 er hangt hier een heel ongedwongen sfeertje dit geeft mij nu een echt vakantiegevoel ik kan hier wel uren blijven zitten
571430 dat is een minpunt dat vind ik juist zo lekker met dit warme weer
571431 ik ben een echte gezelligheidsdrinker als ik uit eten ga neem ik soms een wijntje en op feestjes een flesje breezer maar daar houdt het wel mee op aangeschoten worden is leuk maar stomdronken niet dat is ordinair
571432 maar dat was omdat ik te weinig had gegeten of omdat het iets te gezellig was geworden op een feestje
571433 daar knap ik meteen op af ze kunnen hun handen dan ineens niet van je af houden en spreken met een dubbele tong jakkie
571434 vooral die beat spreekt me aan maar waar ik het liefst naar luister is r amp b
571435 ik vind eigenlijk alles wel leuk zelfs de backstreet boys
571436 ik denk dat je dat nummer het best kan omschrijven als een soort britney spears maar dan anders
571437 ten eerste zongen zij nederlandstalige nummers en ten tweede stonden hun nummers los van de soap wij hebben fictie en realiteit door elkaar gegooid in goudkust werden we als zangtalent ontdekt en besloten het toen ook naar buiten te brengen
571438 oh heerlijk dit vooral lekker om met je voeten in het koude natte zand te draaien lekker zeg moet ik ook nog even op mijn knie n in het water
571439 misschien is deze plek perfect voor mensen die sneller bruin willen worden aangezien wit het zonlicht weerkaatst maar niet voor mij
571440 het is veel te kaal en te ongezellig ach misschien hebben ze wel lekkere cocktails
571441 het lijkt wel een beetje op lounge muziek een soort kruising tussen r amp b en house met een lekkere zware beat er in of is het toch meer een soort new age
571442 ik heb hier een tijdje terug gegeten met vrienden en dat was echt onwijs lekker ik geloof dat we bier tot ongeveer half 12 s avonds hebben gezeten
571443 this study is very important in helping us educate patients
571444 before a patient starts we can go over the symptoms associated with treatment and patients appreciate that
571445 we learned that symptoms last two to three weeks after treatment
571446 in fact they probably get worse during the first and second week after completion of chemoradiation
571447 this advice is based on these symptom studies which will help us develop guidelines and treatment of the symptoms in the future
571448 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

571477 in the first six months of this year we have sold 144 properties with a total value of r114m almost exclusively to young south africans living and working in london in june alone we sold 51 new properties which we thought was pretty good considering the rest of the market seemed to slow down following the introduction of the national credit act
571478 initially we spent a lot of time and money trying to sell to foreigners but we werent getting a good response our expat sales figures just kept climbing though to the point where we arent that interested in foreign sales anymore well revisit the foreign buyer opportunity closer to 2010
571479 its a very different model of marketing and sales than you have here in south africa you cant just put a board up in wimbledon or pop an advert in the newspaper and expect to see results ive seen companies try that
571480 youll find the expat community is exactly that a tight knit community word gets around very quickly so you have to provide an excellent service at all times and your product has to match up to your promises its a big investment on the other side of the world and you really have to help them with it

571506 british bhangra has now come full circle whereas it started off in the post war period as folk dance and music from the punjab in the present it has forged a path for itself making it quite fashionable

571531 and you were once alienated and hostile in mind because of your evil actions
571532 for you brothers became imitators of gods churches in christ jesus that are in judea since you have also suffered the same things from people of your own country just as they did from the jews they killed both the lord jesus and the prophets and persecuted us they displease god and are hostile to everyone hindering us from speaking to the gentiles so that they may be saved as a result they are always adding to the number of their sins and wrath has overtaken them completely

571549 whats friendship when alls done but the giving and taking of wounds
571550 the glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand nor the kindly smile nor the joy of companionship it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when he discovers that someone else believes in him and is willing to trust him with his friendship
571551 someone else believes in you and is willing to trust you with his friendship
571552 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members

571560 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
571561 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
571562 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
571563 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
571564 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
571565 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
571566 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
571567 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
571568 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other

571570 they told me old woman sit down and shut up
571571 in my opinion of what happened it was a verbal lynching

571585 in an age of public cynicism this is very important
571586 it really gives me good satisfaction and warmth in my heart because the people are in need
571587 i was overwhelmed this is nice to see somebody interested in my little life

571591 the reaction of most folks is why south carolina now we are on the radar south carolina could be to hydrogen what houston was to oil we think we can be a significant player
571592 weve been an expert in hydrogen for 50 years and nobody knew it
571593 the research has to do with getting the size and weight down to what the car companies want
571594 there are 175 000 gasoline stations in the country now with hydrogen you are at square one
571595 we are talking about a major transformation of our energy system if gas was four dollars a gallon a few years ago wed already be there

571601 reid was a very strong supporter of the township building and there were some people who were extremely against it
571602 he had the vision at the time and he stood up for it
571603 i knew what he was capable of doing and we worked well together
571604 i can still hear him say if we dont have the money were not doing any expansions
571605 he loved to laugh and he could joke and still be a banker that was the amazing part
571606 he used to drive them to and from that hospital in the same day
571607 not too many people would want to do that but dad loved it
571608 he would run a concession stand for them at the detroit tigers training camp
571609 he was married there he joined there and he remained as a member there ever since
571610 i could bounce ideas off him and get a lot of good feedback he was dependable and you could count on him
571611 people think because they dont see people living on the streets in cardboard boxes that it doesnt exist here theyre wrong
571612 until it opens weve been putting people up for a few nights in a hotel because its all we can do
571613 sometimes we also send them to the shelter in new castle
571614 youre only supposed to stay for 30 days there but they ended up keeping us for six months because we had nowhere else to go
571615 i was obeying the rules and doing what i was supposed to be doing so they kept working with me until i could find a more permanent place to live
571616 they need to let people know about the resources that are out there because most people dont know these agencies exist
571617 theres no homeless shelter here so people have no way of finding out this information
571618 i was like that but now im not shy about asking when i need something
571619 but god lined up all these people to do this for me i didnt do this by myself thats for sure
571620 we are asking the spirits to guide to bless and to create an example for those who have been trusted with this place
571621 it is a unique opportunity for a land trust to be at a groundbreaking
571622 the challenge for local government is to encourage smart responsible government
571623 i have to say before i went to the seminar i didnt really care about recycling
571624 now i see how important it is that we recycle and i want to make sure people are recycling
571625 genocide interests me because its an issue that we as a civilization can really change people shouldnt have to suffer because of the ethnic group that they belong to
571626 top scholars and policy practitioners together to speak with a select generation of future leaders interested in americas role in the world
571627 she was highly recommended by one of her teachers and she submitted an impressive essay that highlighted the importance of raising awareness of genocide as a worldwide issue
571628 most of us at the seminar didnt really know the issues facing the world today
571629 it was really eye opening everybody there had a deep concern for world issues and everybody there took back the idea that they wanted to change to world
571630 some of the most interesting and funniest people i know are teachers particularly social studies teachers
571631 i would say that teammates are your best friends in life
571632 these kids are able to ride a two wheel bike they just dont know it yet
571633 its a rite of passage for young people to be able to do this
571634 by being able to ride a regular two wheel bicycle that looks just like their neighbors bike it helps them become more integrated and involved in the community with their peers
571635 its a really interesting process because its so intuitive instead of teaching the student discovers the balance
571636 when they make that transition to two wheels their world explodes
571637 they have opportunities to work with and be part of a peer group they have for so long been excluded from it gives the family an opportunity to do something together
571638 you get them on those two wheels and it just amazes you youll see this huge change and just seeing the smiles on their faces thats what i get out of it
571639 his parents ended up locking up the bike at night
571640 because it kind of reminds me of races like speed racer
571641 it was emotional it was nice to see him having so much fun doing really well and having some optimism that hes going to get this and have success
571642 its something that he can carry on for the rest of his life not only is it exercise its transportation its the social element hes able to ride with the typical peers in his neighborhood
571643 weve tried to get him to ride a bike with his brother and sister and he just wont do it
571644 you name it and he does it except for riding a bike
571645 it was wonderful he was having a good time speeding right along
571646 every time the ground becomes uneven she becomes very frightened weve always had an issue with the balance
571647 do you think youll be riding a two wheel bike by friday
571648 if they feel im good i can do things if they can come out with that wow we have given them a real gift
571649 according to my calendar it is now early august when will this reopen

571652 luckily my baby girl is as healthy as could be
571653 this is a pretty tremendous difference from the policy of old

571655 dear ms kownacki we are sorry to inform you that your application does not meet our underwriting criteria for approval
571656 of our patients id say 10 percent of kids have it
571657 it is unfortunate shes a very healthy child who has a very routine illness
571658 it really is an anathema to us to have to get state assistance we really feel uncomfortable about that
571659 i think its a great idea you travel all over the southeast and you see so many markers and theyre not always kept up
571660 i think this is just one of those things that is perfect for people to remember their loved one to cherish that memory in a respectful way i would love to be the first one
571661 but we are starting to see more and more of them there are a lot of them on the interstates i really discourage them because when youre driving down the road at 70 mph and most people are probably going 80 and you start looking for little names on a memorial your hand is going to go in the direction of your eyes well encourage them to use our signs
571662 the division had received complaints from citizens about these homemade memorials and some citizens do see them as a distraction
571663 some of these homemade memorials interfere with maintenance operations some are just placed in inconvenient places
571664 i worked with doh on a way to make them available it was just to give families an alternative some people have a very strong tie to the last place where their loved one was it was to be a nice complement to what the state already offers
571665 its a moment of remembrance my mother was the type who was involved in the community so for us it kind of carries on her message not only to her family but to the community
571666 its a reminder you never know whats going to happen
571667 that type of weapon there is no reason for that to be sold we have to push more efforts for gun control
571668 your family cant come visit you your children cant play outside due to violence in your community
571669 black people are more cooperative with police than any people on earth
571670 when you call police they do harm to you and harm to people in your community
571671 can open their doors all day long nothing will come in except flies if you dont engage the youth and keep them there
571672 im sick and tired of the same issues and not being able to solve any of them
571673 when we come back for the sixth picnic i want somebody to say we solved that issue
571674 the autopsy showed that he didnt have a heart attack no aneurysm no stroke basically there were no triggers
571675 its not 100 percent clear from the report how he died we want to get with dr wecht for a clarification
571676 the question is whether the tomei children can show abandonment which is a difficult burden
571677 tina and my mom pat houpt sat in her living room talking about something like this four maybe five years ago
571678 you only have one chance to try and enjoy life i dont care who you are or what you do
571679 im going to take a chance and let them do my makeover
571680 cant have you getting your hair done then having hat hair
571681 the dance was supposed to end at 8 but the last guest stayed until 9 15 we were having too much fun
571682 i dont think ive missed one since i was born
571683 i can remember when i was a little boy all the farm tractors that used to be there when i was 3 or 4 years old i had to sit on every tractor that was there and i remember my dad picking me up on those tractors
571684 the same people are still there but now were there with our kids and our kids are showing cattle and showing pigs and doing things at the farm show
571685 fifty years ago a lot of the people who live in the city had a grandfather or uncle that lived on the farm
571686 maybe they got to go there on sunday but they still had that touch
571687 but now were a generation away from that its neat to educate them where the food comes from and how safe it is
571688 i like the community atmosphere the emphasis on tradition the livestock shows the dairy shows i just think its a nice event
571689 for the most part kids are raising these animals to fund their college education
571690 its important for the agricultural community its an opportunity for them to come together its friendly competition but its also a means of evaluating what youre doing compared to what your neighbor might be doing as far as production
571691 i think its as important now as its ever been maybe more so that the general public understands what agriculture is all about what it takes to produce food that we understand that milk comes from a dairy cow
571692 i asked my classmates who helps you build things and make things and helps you bake cupcakes and who walks you to the library
571693 there are some group homes and programs that are excellent but there are some that are not ideal that leave a lot to be desired
571694 my aunt peg celebrated every day of her life she loved the sunshine and she loved the rainbows and every little budding flower
571695 there has to be a way to provide more people with these kinds of simple pleasures
571696 we would be serving 30 individuals each in three hour shifts initially we would need a transition period and a training period time for the clients to get accustomed just knowing their schedules
571697 we want everyone to have a part in it one family who might have a plumbing business could of course do the plumbing another might work on the hvac the fixtures the kitchen fixtures the ceiling tiles
571698 were accepting small and large donations we can even name a row of plants within the greenhouse in honor of someone
571699 were such a small community now some of our sisters cant go out into the community anymore
571700 in this country we have a lot of early retirees or the elderly home alone
571701 these people are leading lonely lives and they could be spending one or two days a week side by side with an individual who could benefit from their help and experience
571702 think of the thousand people you know who are retired some of those people dont have those connections any more with work or the family that were their lives
571703 were hoping for as many as 5 000 attendees and have booked hotel rooms from washington to uniontown
571704 last year the hcea convention in colchester conn drew about 7 000 visitors
571705 nowadays theres a lot more interest in this equipment and a lot of shows around the country
571706 this will be the third time weve hosted the hcea convention
571707 they liked our site so much in 1993 and 99 they asked us to host them again this year like dummies we said yes its a heck of a lot of work but its also a good way to meet up with old friends you usually see only once a year
571708 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
571709 patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it
571710 when franklin roosevelt died i felt there must be a million men better qualified than i to take up the presidential task but through all of it through all the years i have worked here in this room i have been well aware than i did not really work alone that you were working with me no president could ever hope to lead our country or to sustain the burdens of this office save the people helped with their support
571711 when the other hospitals in pittsburgh heard about it they adopted it
571712 the more i work on this the more i find out about the challenges they faced the roads they pioneered and the sacrifices they made
571713 the sisters of the holy family told me that on their time off they grew vegetables in the back of the hospital to feed the patients during the great depression
571714 despite what this looks like they told me they could get dressed in 15 minutes
571715 prior to that it was common for sisters to be burned out of their convents by people who thought they were trying to help the pope take over the country
571716 when their superiors came from greensburg and wanted to take them back to the motherhouse they elected to stay in johnstown and help out at the temporary hospital that had been set up
571717 the sister who gave them to me remembered giving them to patients
571718 we dont turn people away because they have money and we dont turn people away because they dont have money
571719 if its at all possible there would be sisters or staff or other residents to be with them and pray with them that still goes on
571720 the students were blown away they didnt realize that sisters were still around or that they were doing that kind of work
571721 they are still the pioneers they realize the need to do things that are not being taken care of
571722 it keeps getting better but whats also happening is costs are going up faster than budgets
571723 there are enormous resources to do good things and pennsylvania in general is a state that does good things or tries to that being said the system for kids who need special education is an entitlement the system for adults is not

571736 i only talk about reptiles and amphibians that are native to pennsylvania
571737 my hope is if you get kids to touch a snake or a salamander now they will be less likely to be afraid of them or kill them later
571738 the nicest snake in pennsylvania because youd have to open its mouth and stick your finger in it to get it to bite you
571739 if you find a toad you wouldnt want to pick it up and lick it because it would taste really bad
571740 and it will also release a liquid all over you
571741 and i think its important for kids to experience the world outside them i dont think they get enough of that these days
571742 i like how they eat how they feel what they eat
571743 and i like the way they look i guess i like everything about them
571744 i hope all kids learn about the fauna in western pennsylvania and that they want to be outside looking for bugs or snakes or whatever
571745 i love the game and its good to see my friends
571746 a lady said she had drops of water on her windshield and several people said they had water on their cars we checked
571747 one of the cars was covered with dust because it was parked near a construction zone and there were clean spots amidst the dust maybe it did sprinkle but it wasnt enough the official word is it did not rain
571748 this is my fifth rain day as mayor and it only rained for two of those years
571749 this year i would like to promote my platform which is internet safety keeping children safe
571750 i already had a breakfast meeting today with attorney general tom corbett who spoke about this at my school
571751 im pleasantly surprised we can barely keep up with orders and we dont even have an internet web site yet
571752 though if someone wants to buy it wed be delighted to sell it to them
571753 most people didnt know each other at all and yet there was this wonderful energy going around
571754 going out to see stand up just isnt something that ranks too high on most of our lists
571755 likes guys who dont have genitals on the inside like an alligator
571756 i wish i could say this story is true but its not since gregg posted this entry ive gotten a few e mails asking if i have an aircheck of this show and for the life of me couldnt remember ever calling a listeners mother even a crank callers mother
571757 i hate to take issue with chris t a person i greatly admire and one of my own heroes in broadcast deborah norville finishing a close second but some portions of this story are incorrect
571758 tilden was not a closeted homosexual just because he never slept with a woman doesnt make him gay nikki oldaker author
571759 calling yourself an author when you self published your book ruins your credibility
571760 samuel tilden was either asexual or he was the first gay man to run for president
571761 mi trasero es muy palido y quiero tenerlo rosado que puedo hacer
571762 bueno quitate los pantalones al lado de un panal de abejas y veras que rosadito te queda
571763 at my first speech as leader nearly 20 months ago i spoke of what drove me personally as an individual the traits that i felt i could bring to the leadership of our great party they are the same traits i know i can bring to the leadership of our country
571764 new zealanders from one end of the country to the other are seeking a brighter future
571765 im 21st century digital boy i dont know how to live but i got a lot of toys
571766 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
571767 that a kid with so much compassion could cause his parents so much pain
571768 its me the guy who released you all from your cages remember
571769 geez sorry we tried to eat you you know how it can get mob mentality and all that
571770 ill tell you what makes ya crazy its the taste of blood
571771 ugh that dog thats not the princess where is she
571772 doogie i dont know whether to thank you or not we are free from the farmer but our victory has come with a terrible price are the basement people still alive
571773 ill have an opening segment where i win the crowd over i call it my making fans segment usually ill let the people get to know me a little better or ill do a song and dance number then ill interview some guests and ask them to perform their little bits or whatever
571774 there are no other international markets that need to be addressed in this manner
571775 i think what weve seen is that australia has a very sophisticated coffee culture
571776 people come in our cafe because they know us and they know theyll get good coffee were part of the local community
571777 starbucks is a mcdonalds coffee experience its not about the quality of the coffee its about convenience and location
571778 a few years ago there werent that many of them and they seemed to be going ok but then all of a sudden they were everywhere
571779 some city blocks had three starbucks on them its crazy
571780 what we do isnt rocket science im the first to admit that but youve got to have a passion for coffee that involves everything from grinding the beans to operating the machine
571781 you go into starbucks and its full of teenagers behind the counter id question whether they have that passion
571782 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents
571783 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
571784 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
571785 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections
571786 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
571787 difficult to negotiate an accord when unemployment is on the rise and the economy is weakening
571788 a 40 percent decline in price would have put most developing countries into bankruptcy the issue was one of very survival
571789 i hope that if obama gets elected there will be a new commitment to multilateralism
571790 i hope that obama will realise how important multilateralism is and will resume the talks on a more reasonable basis
571791 by having a lot of issues raised in the same forum it is easier to find a compromise
571792 the agreements already in place protect against the most serious problems
571793 alright well go down and get that furry girl then well eat her make sure you pull off all the hair though
571794 thank the great mole youve come to save me wheres my father
571795 shit im having trouble wielding this since im not left handed
571796 heeeeeere piggy piggy piggy cmon out i promise i wont shoot your pecker off and feed it to my baby cmon
571797 thats a beautiful time machine you have thar i bet youre gonna take it back in time and have anal sex with julius caesar right disgusting i bet youre going to lick his pecker and hold his hand and then settle down and adopt a few children from asia aint ya
571798 and then your parents roy and zoey bailey youse gonna go and tell them im in love with julius caesar and we have sex
571799 im gonna go back in time and make out with judas iscariot
571800 dear sweet lord jesus i never meant i was gonna swap spit with judas
571801 all valid social security cardholders who are u s residents receive a monthly prebate equivalent to the fairtax paid on essential goods and services also known as the poverty level expenditures the prebate is paid in advance in equal installments each month
571802 i keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it
571803 if she showed up naked at my door with a pizza
571804 the total number of screws in the macbook air was several times the number used in a pc we make
571805 i get the sense that hydrology jobs have remained fairly steady compared to petroleum and mining
571806 catholics now have a deeper faith in god after having gone through the calamity
571807 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
571808 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
571809 i think i would like more children i wouldnt want to adopt though i think i have two years left to have a child naturally if i want to
571810 well looks like you and me are waiting for hamburgers
571811 i asked for a hamburger i try not to mix meat and dairy
571812 that sucks ive been here for 30 days and i never saw that the chow hall had gatorade ive been buying gatorade for the past month were moving to fob opsec tomorrow and i heard their chow hall is crap
571813 a epidemia n o perde tempo e avan a enquanto alguns gastam recursos em reuni es nas quais tomam caf e conversam coisas sem sentido
571814 tornar vis vel o impacto do hiv sobre as mulheres

571816 d valos g mez de 29 anos atuava nas farc h 10 anos e era o encarregado da comiss o de seq estros em regi es como o centro e o norte do valle del cauca
571817 were going against a young defense that comes out to win every play
571818 theyre so competitive on that side of the ball that its helping us on offense
571819 but the biggest thing is that hes not spending time with his teammates going through the things theyre going through helps bond our football team
571820 weve been working really hard on getting open on those seams the right opportunity came and the ball was just placed perfect thats all you ask from a guy like carson palmer
571821 youve got to forget whatever youve done before no matter how things are going
571822 its hard to do sometimes but a play like that helps things go better i like those two minute drives theyre fun to do
571823 i started to feel the nerves the last four holes because i knew i had a chance but they were good nerves
571824 im going to try to go in there without any expectations just play well and see where it puts me
571825 there arent many jobs out there that pay 500 000 per year
571826 hes been no 2 for a long long time lets not forget about that
571827 that was when i realized he could make a run for no 1
571828 hes younger than 26 year old federer and just keeps getting better
571829 he wears polos speaks clear english and i think americans like him more
571830 hes different but everybodys got different things that they do
571831 he does a good job of separating his life on the court and life off the court
571832 hes young hes fit and he could stay at the top for a while i think tennis needs somebody whos different like him
571833 when im 60 im going to be faster than these people
571834 every day were making errors and making them at the wrong time
571835 a double play ball and we thought we were out of the inning
571836 brandon is usually as sure handed as heck there is none better than brandon it shocked us all that opened the gates boy that was a terrible game an ugly game we played
571837 elijah dukes hit the ball hard and it just ate me up
571838 it hit the grass and skipped on me off my wrist i told everybody before fridays game guys youre going to make errors on this field you have to read the ball good off the bat because the field is bouncy and fast
571839 you cant catch em all and you learn from your mistakes
571840 lincoln has been pitching great and the balls got through
571841 he made a real good pitch on austin kearns but he got it through the infield that could have been a double play any one of several could have been a double play but they found the holes
571842 this is the big leagues and no matter who it is you just cant let em back in the door
571843 ive been dreaming about being an olympian for a long time but now that ive achieved that goal i want something more
571844 my dream now is to have a gold medal hanging around my neck
571845 she is one of the best athletes ive ever worked with shes just a beast when she trains she just loves to work i knew if we could get her healthy shed be fine and thats the way its worked out
571846 as adults we can better deal with the environment but it could be pretty tough on someone so young
571847 if the stuff is labeled fine but if not im not going to eat it they tend to eat stuff we consider pets
571848 and our events a sprint so we wont be as affected by it as would endurance runners and other athletes out in it for long periods of time
571849 being a double olympian shows you have longevity and persistence
571850 i have experience and knowledge and know what to expect
571851 but i also know things are different now at the 2004 games i wasnt married i didnt have others counting on me i had a single focus it was all about competing all i thought about was beating people
571852 four years later i have a lot more on my plate im a husband a father a home owner that can steal some of your focus but it also adds a lot more too its made my life a lot fuller now i have real roots
571853 let me put it this way i am going to do this thing for 102 million
571854 im going to have seats in the south end zone and i am going to have the scoreboard and i am going to have the club seats done
571855 there were alternatives that we looked at if we had extra money and if we dont they wont be done
571856 but its not things that are visible to the public
571857 babylegs protect crawling babies knees and keep little legs warm especially the often exposed skin between the sock and the bottom of the pant or skirt
571858 call all the children grab a blanket and together begin the journey
571859 el n mero uno es un regalo por el trabajo realizado en el pasado
571860 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
571861 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
571862 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
571863 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
571864 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
571865 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
571866 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
571867 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
571868 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
571869 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
571870 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
571871 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
571872 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
571873 we would have staged the largest ever international streaming event in the history of the internet and you cant do that with high culture
571874 we know the video on demand revenues will take time
571875 we try to do the best from lets say a to m
571876 at that point in time in my life i was going through so much stuff that i just didnt feel like being here
571877 i was depressed i was drinking and taking pills i literally tried to kill myself
571878 we need to realize that greatness so that we can make a better life for the people around us
571879 if i hadnt seen them engage i know i wouldnt be here right now
571880 they touched my soul i wanted to take what they did for me and do it for somebody else
571881 create and present abstract uncensored and true works of poetry monologues raps editorials essays and lyrics from their hearts
571882 sometimes youll hear a poem and it has a little certain rhythm to it
571883 this year we have a lot of dance and music
571884 you do something that will express your feelings be more in touch with your inner self
571885 some people learn about their real lives in these pieces things theyve probably never told anybody this is a chance to get it out and let people know how they feel how do people know whats wrong with our community if we dont tell them
571886 is this what we want in our pristine valleys of clayoquot sound
571887 i would say no i would absolutely say no so i think we have to oppose all of these projects
571888 i never go to europe i never go to the queen and tell her how to be in her territory what gives the right of any other society to come here and say that to me and my chiefs
571889 give us a chance to do what we need to do on our own
571890 this is a clearcut like the old fashioned clearcuts that everybody knew would destroy watersheds would lead to erosion would lead to the siltation in our oceans in our rivers
571891 those precious places like clayoquot sound are getting fewer and fewer
571892 you have to start with the recognition that most wells drilled in the rockies are not oil wells they are gas wells
571893 there would never be an expectation of huge returns on the oil side
571894 weve turned our western lands into a pincushion and gasoline is 4 a gallon and the price of natural gas has gone through the roof
571895 what these data show is that conservation and renewable energy are likely to be the solution to our energy woes
571896 on the oil side the data show that theres just not that much oil out there in the west
571897 youll go from a situation where were growing one billion cubic feet in production a day to a situation where youre flat or declining in two years
571898 its heavier lifting to build the infrastructure to ship energy from where its produced to where its needed
571899 it takes an increasing number of wells to be drilled each year to replace lost production the industry is running very hard just to stay in place
571900 opening protected areas of the coasts or public lands to new leasing is not going to lower the price of gasoline
571901 people say to me why would you trust first nations
571902 i think its a healthy thing to see environmental groups involved and speaking out and negotiating whether its with a first nations government a federal government a provincial government or even a government of another country
571903 we want a place where ideas are spoken about and we collectively try to get to a good place thats why the prospect of disagreeing with a first nations government doesnt concern me im not freaked out at all i think this is a healthy situation
571904 the allegiance of first nations and environmental organizations over the past 25 to 30 years has frankly been a bit of an uneasy one
571905 you know it hasnt always been one where there is an absolute congruent goal i think what that relationship has been historically based on is a common agenda of seeking environmental justice and social justice
571906 its probably up to academics to peel apart whether environmentalists have piggybacked on a set of communities that have had no power and now that they have power the worm has sort of turned
571907 there is something changing theres definitely a power shift thats occurred
571908 but i dont think thats the death knell for environmentalism and i dont think it means there arent agendas in common between environmentalists and first nations
571909 its this conflict between economic development that is sound and has a future and the short term destructive approach
571910 i honestly didnt support the science panel report because i read it as soon as it came out and i dont think the environmentalists read the whole thing there were holes in there big enough to drive 1 000 logging trucks through and were seeing the result of that now
571911 there is a split within the native communities everyone isnt on the same page
571912 it takes a lot in a native community for people to stand up and go against their leadership
571913 things are going to hell right now this biosphere thing is not working its been hijacked by development interests
571914 people have to look into their hearts to make it really work
571915 its not about political manoeuvring or ego or crusading its about making a connection with the land itself the way the old people did communicating with the land and creating a long term vision if it cant happen here its hard to say where or how it could ever happen
571916 i never told anyone i would be leaving this club never ever im very happy weve found a solution
571917 i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family
571918 whenever we play at the same time as an arsenal game nobody shows up
571919 i like man utd because theyre winners actually i like any club that wins in europe nigerians like winners were simple people nigerian clubs can you really compare theyre rubbish i dont waste my time with that
571920 when you look at the stadiums youll find that the stands are virtually empty while the bars and the joints that have satellite tv are full people will pay to watch the premier league on tv but not to watch nigerian football live
571921 in the 1980s i was the only person in my area who was watching english football
571922 any team that tries to express or show signs of practicing witch craft or juju will be penalized because we do not believe such practice can improve football in our zone
571923 ahly was the first ever football club to be 100 egyptian so it is very nationalistic but zamalek has changed their name so many times we sing you used to be half british you guys are the rejects
571924 the two biggest political parties in egypt are ahly and zamalek its bigger than politics its more about escapism the average ahly fan is a guy who lives in a one bedroom flat with his wife mother in law and five kids and he is getting paid minimum wage and his life sucks the only good thing about his life is that for two hours on a friday he goes to the stadium and watches ahly thats why it is such an obligation to win every game it makes peoples lives happy we are probably the only club in the world where we the fans expect to win every single game
571925 etoo will arrive in tashkent on thursday and he will sign a contract with our club at least up until the end of 2008
571926 the term of the contract will depend on our performance in the afc african champions league we will play saipa in the quarter finals and etoo is our main purchase before the knockout stage of the tournament if we can agree with the player he will continue to play for our club in the future
571927 the defining moment of the transfer was not money but the friendly mutual relations between the management of our club and barcelona
571928 the personal friendship between presidents of the clubs has noticeably lowered the transfer fee
571929 nobody at the club knows anything about this i dont think its very likely
571930 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
571931 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
571932 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
571933 it is in our own self interest to be concerned and certainly from a fiscal standpoint we have an interest in times of financial difficulty we have a fixed amount of money and for every dollar we spend on incarceration we have one dollar less to spend on education and other things this is a challenging public policy question
571934 and he gave his wife the ten commandments of pleasure heres the written torah and heres the oral torah darling but she kept him out of the promised land for striking her rock rather than speaking to it
571935 usually when they say theyre ok you give em a couple of more days and its still taking a chance
571936 he says his legs feel a little weak we can rest him the next two days and well see how he is if hes not ok well have to make a decision we hate to waste that disabled list time
571937 it doesnt feel as bad as it did when i hurt it i tried to take it easy during the three days i was in louisville on rehab im hoping its more fatigue than pain we just have to be more cautious now the game plan is day by day sometimes you take four or five steps forward one back then you go forward again and it gets better
571938 but i was a little shocked when i saw him chase that ball in the outfield he only had one ball out there the ball in left center i didnt see him limp in batting practice or anything since he got back just in the game which is what i was afraid of
571939 it doesnt have to be one guy and jay is a little young 21 to put that on him anyway
571940 itll take care of itself leaders arent appointed they are chosen by the other players on the team through their actions
571941 you can appoint yourself but if nobody follows you you aint no leader and ive seen that happen
571942 lets go fellas and youre by yourself it has to be one or more guys with honor and dignity who they can talk to and trust and more than just on a baseball field
571943 he threw strikes kept the ball down good velocity good sink a couple of good sliders only one walk thats the longest he has gone in quite awhile but he kept his pitch count down
571944 he used to be a starter and has been a relief pitcher but when i asked what he preferred he said starter
571945 and im not sending my suitcase back by itself and pay 50
571946 threw a little on the side friday and it felt good
571947 my off speed stuff still has a little rust but its coming
571948 and how amazing the technology was way back technology the general public didnt know about i loved seeing the photos of the spies and cia arrested and put in prison
571949 can you believe somebody can strain a calf muscle running from the dugout to first base to pinch run i did it when we were in cincinnati and i was sent out to run for dmitri young
571950 i would like to thank the cincinnati reds organization for allowing me to fulfill a lifelong dream of playing for my hometown team i will always value the lasting friendships i have with the lindner castellini and williams families
571951 while my nine seasons there were filled with personal highlights like hitting my 400th 500th and 600th home runs in a reds uniform and the negatives of having to fight through too many injuries my biggest regret is that we were not able to win a world championship while i was there
571952 i also would like to thank my many teammates managers coaches and reds employees for their help and support and to acknowledge the many friendly relationships i had with most of the members of the local media i will miss the banter
571953 last but certainly not least i would like to thank reds fans for their support
571954 lopez family is not in the business of bribing people in the pursuit of its businesses or to win cases in court
571955 im having an internal debate about whether my water has broken
571956 can i sit back up a contraction is coming and this suuuuuuuuucks
571957 um i think a contraction is starting can we all get back to business here
571958 for them subjects like the nuclear issue are pretexts the key reason for the hostility of the enemies in the past 30 years against iran is that they want us to pull back so that they can say we have given in
571959 but the iranian people will resist with force against the enemies
571960 iran is continuing to advance toward a military nuclear capability and is heading towards a major breakthrough
571961 for us such a situation that iran will have a nuclear power is an existential threat and from the state of israel point of view it is unacceptable
571962 our estimation is that already by 2009 iran will reach enrichment capability and as soon as 2010 will have option to reach uranium production at military levels
571963 one thing that is clear is iranians are continuing their policy of buying time and so far they are succeeding
571964 i swear as much as i couldnt stand kissinger if kissinger were in the current bush government id be easier because i know this madness thats played out in front of us every day would be tied to whatever kissingers game would be probably to some contract or oil deal somebody would know what the reality is
571965 there is more solid history in that book than any book i know of on that era
571966 hersh has with precision and method disassembled and obliterated his own career and reputation
571967 more bluntly kilcullen who helped general david petraeus design his 2007 counterinsurgency strategy in iraq called the decision to invade iraq
571968 did not seek to clear that quote with me and i would not have approved it if he had
571969 if he had sought a formal comment i would have told him what i have said publicly before in my view the decision to invade iraq in 2003 was an extremely serious strategic error
571970 the project started as response to the need to gather evidence we were constantly filing complaints to no avail on the basis of lack of evidence or we dont know the name of the settler
571971 now we are going back and forth with our video cassettes to israeli police station begging them to press rewind freeze it is the bulk of our work the value of the footage is not only evidential it also has had a remarkable value in terms of advocacy and campaigning
571972 there was a conspiracy of silence surrounding settler violence in particular this footage is shocking to israelis
571973 they held me in the sun for a long time later i heard them discussing what they were going to do with me
571974 i recall hearing a conversation about how to shoot me what i recall is the words rubber bullet rubber bullet i was blindfolded so i was only aware of their aggression
571975 it was only when i saw salams video that i understood what happened to me the guy touching me on my right shoulder before i was shot
571976 just before it happened they said theyre going to beat me they said they were going to send me to hell they know me because ive been to every protest
571977 when i asked for medical attention they said this is nothing we are going to beat you more
571978 in the beginning we were almost begging people to take the cameras with them when they went out they didnt see the use of it but after the media coverage over the susya incident weve gotten a flood of requests for our video cameras and those who have got the cameras are using them much more frequently
571979 it is one of the biggest victories because it is the troops not the settlers
571980 in this case it was remarkable that it was actually the soldiers themselves they did in fact open an investigation
571981 our forces are capable of taking over the security in all iraqi provinces within a year and a half
571982 take over the security portfolio entirely and keep some sic multinational forces only in a supporting role
571983 within three to six months our need for the american troops will dramatically go down
571984 if our people return and take back this lost land its a success
571985 if we are killed trying to do so we have received martyrdom and this will be a great success for us too if we are thrown out of kandahar we will go to the mountains and start the guerrilla war as we did with the russians
571986 jesus h baldheaded christ we have to give the poor bastard something good
571987 son we have to give the poor bastard something good
571988 we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak
571989 who shall count the sum of distinguishing mercy in preserving and upholding providences during the whole of an unconverted state
571990 come and hear all ye that fear god and i will declare what he hath done for my soul
571991 sen marzilli groped me and all i got was this lousy t shirt
571992 a moonbat is someone whos willing to be a little bit of a dreamer
571993 what i see emerging is the people that dont disclose are not going to be the norm
571994 theres an acceptance throughout the country that this is here and its here to stay we are no longer going to sweep things under the rug and hope nobody mentions it
571995 you tell the patient whats happening why its happening and whats being done to prevent it from happening again
571996 if the harm was due to an error you apologize the industry is also learning that the only risk greater than disclosure is the risk to know something and not disclose it
571997 it was a good day for me speech wise but still i was impressed that this guy never missed a word
571998 suddenly he declares hey the elevator is coming up it wasnt i looked through the window and he reached down and pulled my wallet right out of my hands
571999 he just walked away around the vestibule and down the stairs as i softly protested
572000 i come to the hip hop festival when theres someone great like when rakim was here
572001 this year im definitely here for epmd ive got to see them i dont care about any rain
572002 one of the things i certainly think about over and over
572003 when i see a little girl riding a bike alone or pass by a child waiting for a school bus it sends chills down my spine and ties my stomach in knots things just arent like they used to be 30 years ago
572004 i mean i always told holly to be careful of strangers
572005 but then it wasnt like i raised her in a bubble sure you teach your kids to be aware but you cant hide them from the world either
572006 i wish i could make it up to you holly is a very pretty girl she is almost as tall as me i wish i knew holly i hope they found her
572007 they were still hoping that their daughter would be found
572008 and the last thing i wanted was for them to see me as the face of doom and gloom
572009 if i didnt have my sons hollys brothers im sure i never would have survived this
572010 my children have pulled me through and holly is here with us every day
572011 people take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness just because theyre not on your road doesnt mean theyve gotten lost
572012 youre near sighted like me which is a great thing in the modern era because we spend so much time indoors and we can focus on things that are close like computer screens and reading material but things that are distant especially in dim light are not going to be clear at all to you for example you need to wear glasses while driving at night
572013 youre vision is fine youre lucky take care and dont forget to pay on your way out
572014 when it comes to openness and honesty why has the hospital treated me so differently than the way they treated the patient with the wrong side surgery just a few days later
572015 it took a good month to put it all together
572016 became a national hero after defeating the english champion and you can imagine the situation of ireland at that time
572017 the defeat of a british champion held a special enjoyment for the irish people and when he died 70 000 came into the streets to pay their respects
572018 this exhibit isnt just about boxing its about life in america
572019 braddock and his wife at one time thought of giving their children up to family because they couldnt afford to raise them
572020 boxing became a way for others to improve their financial lot in life some like jack dempsey and gene tunney did very well for themselves
572021 childhood is not from birth to a certain age and at a certain age the child is grown and puts away childish things childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies
572022 being paid less than a truck driver at that time you know that makes a difference in life for me
572023 we wouldnt have won five super bowls if we hadnt won the first two
572024 i assure you we would not have won the first two if it were not for fred dean
572025 this election into the hall of fame has taken me back in time i remember people and places i havent seen in a long time
572026 you get used to getting down in the dirt getting your clothes dirty and wallowing a little bit it makes everything come out right when you can stand up out of the mud and feel comfortable
572027 i was small in size but i tell you dirt cant talk about dirt
572028 what i did was i went off and left my glasses and i cant see my words
572029 i can say this that all of the things that have happened for me and to me
572030 can i tell you today at the expense of sounding real self rightous i belong here i belong here i belong here i belong here because i know what to do with it i know what to do with gods fame with gods dollars with gods visibility gods influence and relationships i know what to do with it
572031 getting here did not come without controversy as im sure it did with some of the guys sitting behind me but through it all im here with a greater appreciation for something that not every player i able to achieve and for people who stood up for me and spoke out in my behalf im extremely honored to be iincluded with this group of elite athletes and to do so with the class of 2008 i will wear the banner with pride and i will represent it well thank you
572032 the last 43 years of my life involved with the nfl have taught me through faith hard work determination willingness to get somewhere to a better life i should have a chance to rise from the most modest circumstances and become a hall of famer just like this old undrafted free agent country boy from angleton texas
572033 to the young kids out there i am proof you should do everything you can to live your dream whatever that may be i did not have the material advantages but through commitment to achieving my goals using the advantages that i did have and listening to the wise men and women who offered their support i was able to live my dream this was my dream
572034 its a chance to connect to the second generation of nick viewers
572035 the family hour is about to make a big comeback
572036 every time i see him i tell him his dogs going to be a star
572037 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
572038 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
572039 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
572040 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
572041 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
572042 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
572043 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
572044 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
572045 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
572046 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
572047 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
572048 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
572049 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese
572050 we care less about human rights than other countries and more about sovereignty thats bound to create an awkward feeling among other countries
572051 sometimes as a starter those at bats can kind of be the ones that make or break the game
572052 i wanted to make tough pitches and hopefully make something good happen
572053 theyve got a really good lineup and if you make mistakes they make you pay
572054 unfortunately i made one too many and its kind of a tough one to swallow
572055 i dont know if we want to play the cardinals every day because theyre pretty good but howard seems to play pretty good against them
572056 i think he feels comfortable here hes around his people and hes relaxed
572057 you grew up playing here in front of your family and friends
572058 to be able to do it at the major league level its just like playing back when you were 15
572059 every mistake i throw to him he seems to hit out of the ballpark
572060 im kind of mad at myself i went into that game not wanting ryan howard to beat me and he ended up kind of beating me
572061 ive been pretty much streaky i think most power guys are like that
572062 you always hear that term that they come in bunches but i really only had one good at bat
572063 he kept us off balance moved the ball around the strike zone and just off the strike zone
572064 his route running is coming along and so are his ball skills
572065 hes made some pretty good catches but obviously what jumps out at you and with everybody is just his speed hes so fast
572066 what i find in our league with our players is if you make it important to them and you make it seem important to them all of a sudden they focus on this a lot more
572067 i think you throw out the positives to them and you say hey this is what we need to do this is what we need to work on
572068 and one of the things me and teddy talked about early on in the spring is that hey your catching the ball fast at the end but from a to b its taking you a little bit of time we need that and i told him that will improve when you start to learn the offense and it has
572069 every day i come out i try to do something different
572070 i try to go in watch film by myself and try to see what im doing wrong the older guys on the defensive side are telling me different things to work on and showing me how to get open showing me when im doing things right and when im doing things wrong
572071 thats what training camp is about its to work together thats all we can do
572072 we have a dance audience here that would like to see them do innovative things
572073 we have a very cultured and sophisticated audience for dance
572074 i took the end off of that and put in corps like a corps of dancers or the human body terpsichore also means dance
572075 when they called me the first time six years ago i was working at the zoo
572076 it was nothing exciting just working at the ticket counter i was glad to get the call
572077 heather has a wonderful knack for getting people to do what she wants
572078 trust me i know ive tried to avoid it for years
572079 i like really gutsy fearless dancers who have really great dramatic quality
572080 a lot of my work is really theatrical theatrical ability is really important to me
572081 i dont want to use them multimedia aspects unless theyre integral part of the creative process and an integral part of the story im telling
572082 most of the people i collaborate with work for a lot less than they would to work for anyone else
572083 thats what would get us out of this cycle of constantly having to play catch up
572084 all of our money gets spent within a 10 week period as soon as thats over youre back to zero again money comes in after the show a lot the goal is to raise enough money that youre ahead of the game
572085 there arent a lot of local people here the city has grown so much a lot of people retire here even the retirees who live here year round still tend to give their money to the cities they came from thats their big donation then they give a little money to us
572086 neither asheville nor winston salem would be stuck with the brunt of financing the company
572087 throughout the morning under the expectant sky low sluggish waves exhausted themselves on the shore the pacific was gray and awash with inky shadows as if sinuous sea beasts of fantastical form swam just below the surface
572088 i said the bad word but i also lunged forward as best i could and grabbed my assailant by the ankles
572089 we had several reams of typing paper that were past their expiration date and likely to spoil if i didnt use them
572090 i had thought i was writing a series with an overall theme about the power and beauty of humility indeed i was but it was also something more than that and oddies ultimate destiny will not be merely purification to a state of absolute humility but will be that and something else i find quite wonderful
572091 we just thought it would be a fun thing to do
572092 as to how this relates to my profession im singing with a different choir and interacting with a different congregation but im still in the flow of things
572093 but after we cast it we sat down and realized we had a cast full of families
572094 its like seeing a dr seuss book coming to life
572095 theres fish animals seussical instruments things just come popping out of the set
572096 this is probably the most left field out there choreography ive ever been asked to do to make seuss characters come to life is just such a unique task
572097 i didnt have no girlhood i was just around grown people and i grew up real quick
572098 made up the whole story out of my own head
572099 i get a lot of good preachers on tv here
572100 in the silent days i was taken with rudolph valentino i like robert redford and charlton heston and i also liked john wayne a lot
572101 i had to give up my buick lesabre i saw the brown car but i didnt see the purple car and i smacked right into it
572102 she also sews beautifully she made all of her daughters clothes and she even made wedding cakes
572103 i was 11 years old when we moved to west texas where there wasnt nothing but cowboys and rattlesnakes and coyotes
572104 the only time i disobeyed my mom and dad was when i slipped off to silverton with cass to get married
572105 that first night i slept with his mother mama stegall
572106 my baby was born a little mongoloid girl nobody called it down syndrome then the term came into use in 1961 she weighed five pounds and wasnt expected to stay with us long but she lived until she was 54 years old
572107 lavonne could talk good but never went to school other children can be so cruel
572108 we were poor a lot of years but it didnt matter
572109 it was time to end it i had the last words in my head i didnt want to write on it anymore
572110 failure is unimportant it takes courage to make a fool of yourself
572111 so sit back get naked relax and perhaps get a glass of wine because remember we urge you to take off your clothing very slowly when going bare
572112 you cant leave we just gave you 3 hits of acid
572113 dude i have time to get to my bed before i start trippin balls
572114 girl you changed since i saw you last yada yada yada
572115 chugga chugga riffs break down chugga chugga solo chugga chugga breakdown song ends
572116 considering this show is made up of finale numbers from shows from previous years you should be honored that let your heart sing became the finale of finales
572117 i think its you know hard to meet up with the guys in the offseason and get balls as hard as these guys can throw
572118 so i think thats one of the tougher parts especially if youre not in shape first off being in shape and then getting used to getting those balls and catching them and tucking them away
572119 lou williams comes to terms whats next for the sixers
572120 upset at what she was witnessing caucau approached both the female and male victims and hit them both with her high heeled shoe
572121 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
572122 the car is moving at the same speed as the belt
572123 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
572124 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
572125 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
572126 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
572127 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
572128 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
572129 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
572130 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
572131 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
572132 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
572133 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
572134 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
572135 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
572136 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
572137 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
572138 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
572139 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
572140 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
572141 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
572142 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
572143 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating

572166 were waiting to see who can tough it out for the longest
572167 its like guerrillas weve scattered to the hills and countryside
572168 we thought the olympic games would be an opportunity to resolve our problems its not turning out that way but this is our big chance
572169 this is a step back from a society shaking free of control and arbitrary power
572170 without security assured there can be no successful olympics and the national image would be lost
572171 the stability of beijing must be ensured through nationwide stability
572172 strictly ensure key individuals who may threaten social stability are subject to administrative measures with no loopholes or lapses and no abnormal petitioning to beijing
572173 many people feel that if they dont get their problems addressed during the olympic games theyll never see them solved because the games are the biggest kind of pressure

572192 we have absolutely no concerns about the organization no regrets come the 9th of august the opening day of competition the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over
572193 if we allow political propaganda its the end of the harmony of the olympic village and the end of the harmony of the games

572283 security council extends joint un au darfur mission despite controversy
572284 the reduction of the complex political context to a morality tale
572285 the similarities between iraq and darfur are remarkable the estimates of the number of civilians killed over the past three years is roughly similar the killers are mostly paramilitaries closely linked to the official military which is said to be their main source of arms the victims too are by and large identified as members of groups rather than targeted as individuals but the violence in the two places is named differently in iraq it is said to be a cycle of insurgency and counter insurgency in darfur it is called genocide why the difference who does the naming who is being named what difference does it make
572286 the reduction of a complex political context to a morality tale unfolding in a world populated by villains and victims who never trade places and so can always and easily be told apart it is a world where atrocities mount geometrically the perpetrators so evil and the victims so helpless that the only possibility of relief is a rescue mission from outside preferably in the form of a military intervention

572344 full recognition of legal identity assured access to the courts basic labour protection the right to own property and the rule of law to prevent exploitation by the powerful are vital tools to enable the poor to realize their full potential
572345 there are four billion people around the world who are denied the rights protections and opportunities afforded by the rule of law
572346 despite producing as much as 80 of food in developing countries women own less than 10 of the worlds property empowering women with property rights would lead to a significant reduction in poverty and malnutrition
572347 vulnerable to exploitation do not receive employment benefits suffer poor working conditions and hold jobs that are never secure
572348 by giving the poor access to legal protections such as property rights and security of tenure labour rights and business rights we allow them to get maximum value for their work enabling them to lift themselves from the grips of poverty
572349 those who consider the poor to be just another part of the human condition are ignorant for the poor do not accept it and when given the chance will seize the opportunity to transform their lives

572694 find out if it is an actual gem in the first place and that the other three episodes dont take a sudden downturn in quality before i buy the dvd to support the release of buried archive gems
572695 since opening the first music box at 1235 weve had a steady stream of kids come in off the street and literally just jump into writing performing and recording their own songs
572696 in the 16 months since we opened the music box ive witnessed major positive developments in the personal responsibility social skills and work ethic of the kids who participate
572697 the young members of the santa barbara community wont have time to get into trouble if they are busy doing something they love
572698 we can make a real difference in our kids lives and in the overall well being of our community
572699 with your support we can provide an inspiring safe musical environment and be a profoundly positive influence in their lives
572700 in this page you find the ranking to determined the most beatiful woman in the world
572701 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
572702 her first words were she was very happy to see very nice people she was ecstatic
572703 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
572704 the gun go off the race be over he was talking about his own steroid fueled dominance but he could have been describing an average fans view of any 100
572705 this time there is absolutely no pressure on asafa and that might be the best thing for him
572706 if you think charging people 391 percent interest is a good thing youre probably working for the payday lending industry theyre the only ones who think its a good idea
572707 its a drain on the economy its bad for consumers ohio doesnt need this especially right now
572708 its providing another opportunity for our customers to have some fun
572709 right now i dont really know that much about all the cars
572710 the british make some really dependable cars and theyll run forever if you take care of them
572711 i came to the conclusion that this is a winnable race
572712 its like a family reunion in rwanda everything is about family and community
572713 before now so many of us were just struggling to get our lives going in this country
572714 were starting to get to the point that we can think about more than just surviving
572715 thats good but we have a culture of our own and we dont want to lose it
572716 start punishing and locking up the business owners who hire these people
572717 im not talking about fining em 1 000 im talking about taking assets in millions youd only have to do a few theyd get the message
572718 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
572719 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
572720 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
572721 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
572722 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
572723 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
572724 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
572725 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
572726 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
572727 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
572728 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
572729 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
572730 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
572731 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
572732 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
572733 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
572734 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
572735 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
572736 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
572737 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
572738 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
572739 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
572740 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
572741 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
572742 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
572743 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
572744 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
572745 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
572746 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
572747 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
572748 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
572749 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
572750 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
572751 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
572752 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
572753 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
572754 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
572755 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
572756 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
572757 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
572758 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
572759 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
572760 it looks like ty has some plaque build up nothing to worry about but you can get them cleaned
572761 we try to be as nonpartisan as we possibly can sometimes its a little more difficult for members on the democratic side to be recipients
572762 we used to generate a scorecard but we havent done that in a few years we dont claim membership what we have are supporters
572763 what they are saying to the average american is that they are a group for seniors it implies that seniors are members
572764 the qualification for being a guardian of senior citizens must be that you are a republican running for re election
572765 i imagine that right now youre feeling a bit like alice tumbling down the rabbit hole
572766 however they are very close to the end and i think it is very difficult moving on further from this point there is no power in turkey that can stop ergenekon
572767 the turkish national intelligence agency m t sent a top secret report to the prime ministry
572768 m ts document included the ergenekon gangs schema and this organizations investigation was requested
572769 in the organizations schema dated 2003 there were politicians businessmens and journalists names listed as ergenekon members
572770 in the gangs list of journalists a general editor of a big news daily its ankara representative and a very popular journalist are listed
572771 among ergenekons businessmen there were listed both industrialists and media bosses too
572772 it cannot be proof that those people on the ergenekon lists were doing anything for ergenekon either consciously or unconsciously
572773 a series of names who are active today in politics business and media were reported by m t to the prime ministry that they might have a relationship with ergenekon and should be investigated
572774 m t collected intelligence about ergenekon which is thought of as a
572775 im not going to write the names in order not to implicate anyone
572776 i will just let it go at this the prime ministry conveyed this document on 2 july 2008 to the people who are responsible for the investigation of ergenekon
572777 based on current information though we are not certain we have the impression that the works that are being implemented using the name
572778 however the information came about in an indictment form from various sources that are parallel and consistent with each other gives meaning that is more than gossip and it indicates the signs of a directed and organized activity
572779 for this reason the current information about the indicates that the subject aims to gain control over civilian will covertly and the creation of a new administration with a new formation under the directed control of cadres of people who have a military origin using some non governmental organizations ngos and political parties as well as the media
572780 ergenekon is identified as an illegal organization by m t undersecretariat itself and this has been recorded with an official report
572781 according to the indictment ergenekon has a long history however m t is unaware of this
572782 it is reported from m t to the prime ministry that today there are names that are active in the political arena business and media that might be linked to ergenekon
572783 im posting it because it looks more like a free press investors unfazed by 15
572784 despite posting the third worst loss in its 100 year history general motors corp
572785 over a womans lifetime the current pay disparity could cost her from 400 000 to 2 million in earnings relative to a man performing equivalent work

572797 it was great seeing jenny mccarthy again for the taping of the snme after so many years
572798 were republican activists within the party we feel were operating under the law
572799 to my knowledge this type of law only exists in florida our strategy has always been to work in a civil and cooperative fashion within the republican party
572800 un american we have every right to use that name
572801 theyre generally nice people but also are zealots they would marginalize other republicans moderate and conservative this augurs no good for the party in the long term
572802 dedicated themselves to victory in november for the republican slate
572803 bashing the republican party did nothing to advance our agenda
572804 a chunk of the base of republican voters can be turned our way
572805 they obviously do not take their oath seriously because they both are actively trying to torpedo mccains candidacy as evidenced by their stated intentions to demonstrate against mccain at the national convention in minneapolis i want republicans to know whats happening
572806 were a little more expressive and passionate than other party members kind of in your face
572807 i dont believe the state party has legal grounds to prevail in a lawsuit
572808 but if hes a true conservative republican i will support him with vigor if he is not i wont if the republican party would move back to its base it would be more cohesive and more effective getting republicans out to vote
572809 boy it sure would be nice if i had a sister who was an aesthetician

572813 only risks to the security of our vital interests or egregious offences to our most cherished political values should disqualify a nation from entering into a free trade agreement with us
572814 from financiers to factory workers we all have a stake in each others success
572815 on righting trade human rights trade and the 2008 election
572816 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
572817 given that they have announced these parks i think the government will want to show that citizens have scope to use them
572818 china wants to show it is progressing in human rights
572819 i am thrilled to be able to support the silver star appeal which works for such an honourable cause it raises funds to run a mobile diabetes assessment unit
572820 mr bachchan has been more than co operative in giving us the dates we require the america schedule is planned for early next year based on the permissions we have secured for the required shooting locations
572821 and it contains sprayable pancake mix sounded disgusting but im housesitting for someone without groceries so i grabbed the can and promised to make a memorable little breakfast
572822 i can hardly stand it you dont understand sometimes why things like this happen to kids
572823 my prayers and thoughts go out to the family and what theyre going through its hard for us but so much harder for their family
572824 i sacrificed myself for this camp and did my best
572825 he thought i was going to break down but i didnt i went ahead and did my best
572826 at that moment i realized i was in a room with the greatest athletes to ever play this game
572827 for me it was a privilege something which i watched in awe
572828 art was all about doing his job doing it well and doing it without ever saying a word
572829 he wasnt some prima donna receiver that everybody sees with other guys he wasnt no diva he was all about being dependable
572830 although he is a great speaker he would rather show you than tell you
572831 fellow hall of famer deacon jones said i would cry
572832 am i going to cry you gotta be kidding me
572833 can i tell you today at the expense of sounding real self righteous i belong here
572834 i belong here because i know what to do with it i know what to do with gods fame with gods dollars with gods visibility gods influence and relationships i know what to do with it
572835 thats the best feeling in baseball is when you get a pitch and you hit it well and you know its gone
572836 hes making his presence known throughout the lead hes becoming a prime time player
572837 it is not a question of who will or will not stop jelimo because that creates bad blood among runners
572838 i tested my strength in rome and paris i think i am fine and only waiting for beijing
572839 i returned home to train in my country with my compatriots so that we can plan together so far so good
572840 i started running in my home district secondary school of koyo in nandi south district but i never went beyond district level
572841 but after finishing school in 2006 i had enough time last year and prepared well hence where i am now
572842 time will tell there is always room for improvement and that will come to pass i am now focusing on the olympics
572843 if you dont think you can do it you shouldnt be here thats for sure
572844 it was a fun situation to be in and im happy i got the opportunity
572845 the beijing olympics is an opportunity once in a hundred years but when i am in the competition i will think of it as nothing more than an ordinary competition
572846 the young generation of chinese gymnasts are really capable with very high starting scores on degree of difficulties but it is also a risk
572847 the gymnastics is all about on site performance so their biggest rivals will not be the americans but themselves
572848 competing on home soil will surely be an advantage no matter where i compete i will keep a calm mood to reduce mistakes and bring out my abilities
572849 i still believe that it comes down to our pitching
572850 weve got to pitch the ball well and play good defense were going to have days like this we havent had one in quite a while
572851 francisco has done pretty much everything that he needs to do down there
572852 now its time to see what hes going to do up here
572853 i wasnt ready when i was here so i had to go down and get myself ready
572854 the pressure is on them to keep winning and stay in first
572855 if you dont make adjustments fast enough youre not going to hang around
572856 my goal is clear and simple the gold medal in the womens singles
572857 i thought she might not be able to go on until 2008
572858 it took great courage and motivation for her to make it
572859 he is the kind of person that exerts himself to the utmost after watching him play i have become a bit more aggressive
572860 after the olympics i can finally live the life i really want to with holidays studying and marriage i am really looking forward to it
572861 i just want to be the woman who cooks soup for dan after the games
572862 our defence held us in especially in the second half with some big plays
572863 they were pretty much waiting on him at the line of scrimmage once he got there
572864 they did a good job of getting off our guys and getting back there and making the tackle
572865 my teammates got off the ball real good and i just cleaned up
572866 our guys came to play and got pressure we worry about the plays in front of us and not the plays behind us
572867 i probably would have had to hit one of the best balls of my life to get that sucker in
572868 we came here knowing it was going to be a tough game and it was
572869 our offensive line won the battle and our line pounded them around giving us holes
572870 its coming to a point where we need to do a lot better with our discipline
572871 for a couple games now weve hurt ourselves until we correct that its going to be a long season
572872 you have to be realistic i have nothing against this guy its nonsense
572873 the world faces a global climate emergency it is now clear that only action by both developed and developing countries can prevent the climate crisis from deepening
572874 the aim is to limit global temperature increases to two degrees above pre industrial levels
572875 the time is right for the countrys private sector to show leadership by partnering with government to develop a solutions driven national climate change mitigation and adaptation response
572876 the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of mitigating the effects of climate change
572877 our emissions per capita are higher than many other developing countries south africas emissions per capita are also high due to our coal based energy system
572878 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents
572879 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
572880 i made a decision not to politicise the games this is for athletics
572881 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
572882 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
572883 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
572884 although men have higher incidence and mortality from all non sex specific forms of cancer than women the public face of cancer in our study was overwhelmingly female
572885 this imbalance in television reportage of cancer may be distorting political and community perceptions about which cancers are most prevalent and tractable and thereby deserving of government and community support research investment and individual vigilance
572886 for example breast cancer attracts unparalleled research funding from individuals and governments while other cancers causing more disability struggle to gain a fraction of such support
572887 as a former australian health minister commented its not sexy to have testicular or prostate cancer so you dont get a run in the media
572888 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
572889 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections
572890 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
572891 difficult to negotiate an accord when unemployment is on the rise and the economy is weakening
572892 a 40 per cent decline in price would have put most developing countries into bankruptcy the issue was one of very survival
572893 i hope that if obama gets elected there will be a new commitment to multilateralism
572894 i hope that obama will realise how important multilateralism is and will resume the talks on a more reasonable basis
572895 by having a lot of issues raised in the same forum it is easier to find a compromise
572896 the agreements already in place protect against the most serious problems
572897 i think the fed is going to stand on the sidelines holding at two per cent were getting a very mixed economic picture right now
572898 i think the housing market is really the central element of this crisis
572899 the fed will do nothing next week fed will keep fed funds at two per cent voice its concern about the longer term inflation threats from commodity prices
572900 in the minutes of its june meeting the fomc characterised the economic outlook as very uncertain and the appropriate path for interest rates as quite unclear arguably this foggy policy environment has only worsened in the intervening six weeks

572902 it wasnt alcohol and drugs that was my problem it was
572903 every year or two like clockwork headlines appear that we have created a pill or some cutting edge treatment to cure alcoholism these claims have not come to reality
572904 even if the magic pill did come along allowing you to once again drink like a normal person would you take it
572905 our membership ought to include all who suffer from alcoholism hence we may refuse none who wish to recover nor ought a a membership ever depend upon money or conformity any two or three alcoholics gathered together for sobriety may call themselves an a a group provided that as a group they have no other affiliation
572906 the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking
572907 i havent been with anyone in two years how can it be herpes
572908 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work

572910 watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh
572911 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
572912 the time has come for us to reveal the facts and tell the world how outside forces are creating troubles in pakistan
572913 wants to destabilise fata what india and afghan president mr karzai are doing must stop they must stop this they must stop this
572914 one call from outside leads to the death of four people in balochistan
572915 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
572916 with the growing number of attacks and an expansive reach one could argue al qaeda is even growing stronger
572917 we are winning the war on terror in fact weve almost won the war on terror
572918 measuring the total number of terrorist attacks globally from a us national security perspective is meaningless because most of those groups are not targeting the united states
572919 to be effective against terrorism in many ways requires the same things that are needed to be effective against crime its knowing neighborhoods good intelligence and on the ground information exactly the kind of information we lacked in iraq the first three years of the operation
572920 this is whats so difficult about terrorism its a blend of political and just plain old criminal justice stuff
572921 the adversarys real center of gravity is its narrative and we have to find ways to facilitate it falling on its own weight
572922 al qaeda has made its colors very clear people see it for what it is a violent ideology that will kill anything and everything in its way to meet its so called objective
572923 its unraveling even some of the intellectual thinkers within the movement are peeling away the justification and credibility of al qaedas narrative
572924 the british have long since dropped any reference to a war on terror in part because of their long standing experience fighting the irish republican army
572925 where they became increasingly successful is when they started using special branch their counter terrorism police force as well as mi 5 their domestic intelligence service its the use of those two actors together that really helped penetrate the ira not the military
572926 we could easily have another event we dont want to blow it out of proportion we want to keep things in perspective
572927 its great we havent had another attack but were still not out of the woods
572928 whats the matter with you jay you look like a bloody goldfish staring at a headlight
572929 the most beautiful place in the world with high mountains rivers and gorgeous valleys

572941 well then sania come closer and get a look a mine
572942 now baby open your mouth and cover your teeth with your lips
572943 recent research suggests that exposure to cleaning products or air fresheners that contain a certain volatile organic compound voc called 1 4 dicholorobenzene 1 4 dcb
572944 yet a third study reported by university of washington researchers this week in the journal environmental impact assessment review found that the fumes from
572945 most people with asthma instinctively avoid these types of products said dr david rosenstreich director of the division of allergy and immunology at montefiore medical center in new york city but he added the study on vocs suggests that
572946 parsons won its lucrative deal in 2004 to do security and justice work in iraq as part of a dozen other big reconstruction deals of 53 construction projects in the parsons contract only 18 were completed
572947 auditors gave parsons a scathing report on one of its biggest projects a multimillion dollar prison in diyala that was to house 1 800 inmates and help alleviate overcrowded facilities calling it a failure and wasteful
572948 but now the prison known as kahn bani saad correctional facility sits unfinished and dilapidated

573031 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
573032 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
573033 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
573034 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
573035 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
573036 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction

573042 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
573043 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
573044 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
573045 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
573046 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
573047 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
573048 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
573049 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
573050 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
573051 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
573052 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce

573062 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
573063 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
573064 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
573065 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all

573071 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
573072 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
573073 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
573074 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction

573082 start building a new future from the rubble of a failed scottish christian empire a game of releasing a new scottish christianity that loves not its old empire lovin self that will let go of the dark desire to manage god and his people and run into the arms of a rather more wilder christ who seems to have no interest in congregations services or leaders but is full of dreams for and is passionately intimately involved with his land of haggis neeps and tatties to re find their faith in his warm friendship in the healing of his land
573083 church is no longer a wee clan or a kind of religious primary school or some thing you idolise or upkeep or visit or manage but church at its depths breadth and height stretches and becomes an ontology a whole way of being 24 7 it is a covenant with god and with the land and its people in that particular locality a covenant to see it through to the bitter end no matter what it costs til all people all the powers that be and all of creation itself in that specific locality come to perceive the height and depth and breadth of gods love in christ jesus
573084 incarnational revolution of saints and their dreams moving into the land
573085 loads of ways of incarnating christian community without defaulting to congregations and loads of ways of transforming the land without defaulting to setting up christian organisations and tons of colourful ways of christian practice that dont involve knee jerking into colonial style ministries prayer worship and teaching are already happening around us very differently in peoples lives

573177 la modificaci n de las tarifas siempre se han llevado al pleno municipal
573178 la idea es tener la fuente de la plaza de espa a siempre llena
573179 lo que hab a antes era una peque a plaza con coches alrededor ahora se ha convertido en un lugar de ocio para descansar para pasear para que jueguen los ni os
573180 esta actuaci n se llevar a cabo mediante el sistema de concesi n
573181 cuando los contenedores de la d rsena de los llanos se trasladen al dique del este y al puerto de granadilla quedar una amplia zona en la que se podr a ubicar una zona de ba o para la capital
573182 tambi n tendremos la playa de valleseco que se extender a lo largo de un kil metro
573183 when stats and ramirez are both in the lineup and healthy that teams been very successful now its going to be different but it doesnt mean it changes the quality of their team theyre still going to score a lot of runs and theyre still going to have good pitching
573184 the rash of bad news about bank failures convinces us that a turnaround isnt going to happen this year
573185 they had more of an old school business model now its the children who are running it
573186 im not going to get thrown out of a game unless im pretty sure the pitch was a ball
573187 ive been thrown out two times in 10 years i think there was just a lot of frustration in that at bat
573188 he reminds you of a mini manny ramirez he was hitting opposite field homers in batting practice you cant teach that
573189 will i have enough money to live as i want

573192 el perfil de la persona necesitada ha cambiado por completo se ha ampliado y se ha rejuvenecido mucho
573193 mucha gente gana menos de 9 000 euros al a o los que antes llegaban a fin de mes muy justos ahora no llegan
573194 parejas con hijos que alguno de los dos trabajaba en la construcci n se han visto abocadas a pedir ayuda
573195 algunas personas no pueden pagar un jarabe ni con la receta del m dico
573196 la situaci n ha empeorado en los ltimos ocho meses si antes d bamos un cheque de 30 euros ahora es de 20
573197 nuestra situaci n es dif cil tenemos mermados los fondos ahora hay que dividirlos entre m s gente
573198 la administraci n p blica no puede dar respuesta a las familias necesitadas en el momento y entoces nos los remiten a nosotros c ritas intenta que nadie se quede fuera de sus servicios pero el presupuesto tiene un l mite en el a o 2007 atendimos a m s de 18 000 personas
573199 las donaciones personales en las parroquias s que han disminuido
573200 esto es consecuencia del envejecimiento de la poblaci n la mayor a de las personas que donaban durante la misa ahora han empezado a cobrar la pensi n y algunas ni eso seis de cada diez mayores viven en el umbral de la pobreza
573201 el rostro de la pobreza a n es femenino aunque cada vez hay m s hombres
573202 antes la mayor a de los solicitantes inmigrantes ten an entre 40 y 45 a os ahora aunque juren que son mayores de edad algunos no tienen m s de 17
573203 tenemos que velar para que les paguen por un trabajo justo y ahora teniendo en cuenta como est la situaci n la econom a sumergida es nuestra nica salida pero no a cambio de que los exploten esperemos que la situaci n mejore porque sino las consecuencias va a ser imprevisibles
573204 no contempla en el documento aprobado de forma inicial ni la actuaci n tur stica ni la capacidad alojativa que lleva adscrita por lo que se deslegitima desde la perspectiva territorial tur stica
573205 el 59 por ciento de las nuevas infecciones se han diagnosticado en fase asintom tica mientras que un 14 7 por ciento tienen s ntomas sin reunir criterios de sida un 22 3 por ciento de las nuevas infecciones se diagnostican en fase de enfermedad de sida lo que indica un retraso en la detecci n de la infecci n vih
573206 por otra parte tenemos un 3 4 por ciento de infecciones en que no consta su estad o cl nico hecho que debe ser mejorado
573207 es lo suficientemente vergonzoso que m s de dos millones de personas fallecieran el a o pasado muchas de ellas sin tener ni siquiera acceso a la primera l nea de tratamiento
573208 muy poco para paliarla por lo que la organizaci n urge a los gobiernos a que desarrollen e implanten planes de emergencia
573209 juan domingo per n abri generosamente las puertas a los nazis y los protegi pero esa actitud no se limit a su gobierno sino que fue una pol tica de estado hasta 1983
573210 me siento feliz porque seguro que ser el n mero uno requiere mucho trabajo durante mucho tiempo
573211 por la forma en que l est jugando nadie pens que perder a pronto
573212 trat de no pensar en su racha ganadora ni en su nuevo lugar en el ranking
573213 no creo que haya mucha diferencia entre una semifinal y una final pero ser a estupendo ganar este torneo
573214 tendr que enfrentar a uno de los mejores jugadores del mundo para lograrlo pero creo que estoy jugando suficientemente bien para hacerlo
573215 el ha jugado incre ble en los ltimos cinco a os
573216 todav a juega muy bien pero as es el deporte cuando alguien tiene logros tan grandes los dem s encuentran alguna forma de alcanzarlo
573217 idea es que el lago o fuente de la plaza de espa a se mantenga lleno pr cticamente todos los d as salvo excepciones
573218 en caso de que haya mucho viento la potencia del chorro ser mucho menor
573219 tanto el agua del g iser como el del lago es salada
573220 sabemos cu l es el objetivo sabemos que va a ser un camino muy dif cil y que el que mejor fondo tenga y llegue al ltimo tercio del campeonato en condiciones ptimas va a tener m s posibilidades
573221 nosotros vamos a ir paso a paso sin renunciar a nada y con la cabeza en nuestro sitio y los pies en el suelo
573222 es importante no vender humo y sobre todo crear ilusi n
573223 est muy bien este a o un poquito cambiado en el sentido de querer mejorar la campa a anterior y si se puede con creces
573224 ha venido muy mentalizado para ver si se produce esa mejor a
573225 se ha formado un grupo excelente y as se trabaja con muchas ganas e ilusi n
573226 el planteamiento del t cnico es parecido al m o
573227 sigo pensando que los jugadores que tenemos aqu son los mejores de la categor a
573228 no podemos decir que el equipo equis es mejor que el nuestro
573229 nosotros tenemos que luchar y mirar por lo que tenemos en casa y potenciar todo eso convencidos de que es as
573230 en principio no es bueno ni decirlo porque hay que dar tranquilidad a los jugadores con los que estamos trabajando
573231 si llegan ser n bienvenidos y si no es as intentaremos luchar con lo que tenemos
573232 este servicio supone uno de los mayores logros dentro de la lucha antidroga en especial en el tr fico de hero na y con ella se cierra la investigaci n y queda desarticulada una de las redes m s importantes de narcotraficantes de origen africano que operaba en las islas canarias siendo la sexta actuaci n policial que se realiza en la isla de tenerife en los ltimos meses por parte de este equipo de la guardia civil
573233 ir cogiendo la forma para el inicio de liga ante el n stic
573234 se trabaja bien hay un buen tiempo y el nico inconveniente es el aire que hace
573235 es una experiencia m s y una pretemporada en su sitio nuevo para m
573236 hay un equipo muy completo que tiene calidad que tiene gol y a lo largo de la temporada habr jugadores que sumen seis o siete tantos
573237 un buen equipo de la categor a pero los resultados dir n si es mejor o peor que nadie
573238 hay buen conjunto una buena base jugadores con experiencia y con calidad aunque vamos a ir poco a poco y plasmarlo en el campo que es lo importante
573239 i wore color coordinated dresses high heels and gloves to work girls didnt wear slacks back then although i carried a pair in a little sack just in case i had to climb into high places

573242 what but houlihans the worst player ive ever seen how could he have beaten you
573243 houlihan said youll see then as i was teeing off just as i had my club poised he screamed out
573244 the scream threw me off and i missed the ball completely
573245 but still thats only one swing how did he win the game
573246 has continued to be quite concerned about the whole planning effort
573247 they speak to a certain constituency who might otherwise support the initiative
573248 make the high speed rail system much more effective in carrying more people and relieving congestion
573249 how are we going to build the trains through the cities when the cities say we dont want you
573250 she is your wife she made the mess you should take care of her
573251 they were cutting the tree earlier in the day and they were moving the truck and the son told him yelled move out of the way and the older man didnt hear him and it just hit him
573252 but i do not have my own ideas for pictures
573253 i know he is mad but believe me theres method in his madness
573254 i am willing to suffer for all eternity if this is possible
573255 hoy hab a que decirle al gobierno que igual que durante 2006 y 2007 cuando de juana fue trasladado de hospital en hospital por consideraci n de car cter humanitario y luego volvi a la c rcel creemos que hoy tambi n se pod a haber hecho algo m s
573256 considerable benefits which are to be derived from this gambling licence must include benefits to the king the royal family and the entire mpondo nation
573257 this is a political intervention to give the anc a chance to organise ahead of the elections
573258 the anc is going to lose the election it doesnt matter who the premier is
573259 deep feeling among coloured voters that the anc is not there for them
573260 over 10 years of the mbeki presidency the anc has increasingly come across as a black african nationalist organisation
573261 it takes a long time for voters to detach themselves from a party but when they do it can be dramatic
573262 in the macassar drakenstein and riviersonderend by elections we won over anc voters and we also brought out new voters
573263 i want to be prime minister in order to carry out changes and corrections because the public no longer has confidence in politicians and this confidence should be restored
573264 if i were the coach i would replace the players and see if a different result was possible
573265 in the face of the food price crisis its ironic that the debate came down to how much and how fast nations could raise their barriers to imports of food
573266 but im afraid that on this subject an irresistible force met an immovable object and the rest is history

573271 the most significant challenge to the recovery process in sri lanka is ongoing civil conflict escalating violence over the past few years has set back reconstruction efforts in the north and east of the country though it continues largely apace in the south
573272 security concerns have posed operational hurdles across a range of sectors making it difficult or impossible for international aid partners to move or deliver assistance and supplies restrictions on transportation of certain construction materials such as cement and steel as well as difficulties in accessing certain areas have hampered recovery
573273 security has remained a problem sometimes even after completion of projects and people have returned to their normal jobs
573274 there is a big checkpoint at manampitiya about 80 km northeast of batticaloa city where everything is thoroughly checked even fish lorries
573275 some of the fishermen complain that when the checking takes too long or when their loads are unloaded and kept in the open too long the fish are spoiled and not sellable by the time they reach their destinations
573276 when there are incidents on the road we are afraid to travel on them very early in the morning or late at night
573277 there is no transport on the road to the beach so we cycle or take a motorbike

573282 parking was a big issue during a public hearing on monday the math is simple if you take up two lanes for rail and two lanes in each direction for cars and buses that doesnt leave much room for on street parking and university avenue businesses depend on that parking
573283 were looking at nearly a thousand spaces of surface parking being removed from community businesses about 83 to 85 percent depending on which part of the avenue youre looking at its almost all of the surface parking on the street now theres off street parking options for some businesses but many of the smaller businesses in the frogtown neighborhoods are landlocked they rely on the on street parking in front of their business and we need to do something to restore some of that
573284 we did know that there was going to be some loss of on street parking what has happened over the last year or so is weve had a pretty extensive public involvement process and through that process weve learned that the community has concerns about safety and the ability to cross the street at every block so as weve been going through the planning process weve added some amenities and some features that ended up in that additional loss of parking so what has happened is that weve really listened to the community and this loss has actually been a result of the process and not the lack of a process
573285 whats the goal of the central corridor line itself i realize its getting people from point a to point b but what is the integration with the neighbor and the businesses and the residents whats the overall vision
573286 the overall vision for the corridor is that we will be projecting to have about 42 000 riders a day that would be connecting some of the very popular destinations in the region with the university of minnesota the midtown area the capitol area and of course the two downtowns
573287 another thing we find is that theres a lot of social services in this corridor in our outreach efforts weve talked a lot to them and found out that they are really excited about this project because they see it as another opportunity for their clients a lot of which dont have the option of driving they cant drive or they dont drive or they cant afford to drive and so in talking to some of those like goodwill and arc of minnesota and model cities they are really excited about this opportunity for their clients
573288 die kochen hier zwar sehr gut aber nach einiger zeit merkt man doch dass das essen aus derselben k che kommt

573303 if i were sitting in the jury i wouldnt vote for a conviction
573304 even a judge saw the lack of evidence in my husbands case
573305 there was a common understanding that education on online behavior needs to be strengthened
573306 the primary goal is just to deliver the satellites into orbit
573307 run downstairs to the basement and grab me a jar of x
573308 on stage on television or on the radio waves everyday i feel lucky because im always on
573309 in my business its essential to be contactable 24 7 i couldnt organize as much as i do without being always on
573310 ive seen people get out of their wheelchairs and dance more times than i can count so im happy i can make a difference playing for those who are less fortunate than me
573311 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
573312 given that they have announced these parks i think the government will want to show that citizens have scope to use them
573313 china wants to show it is progressing in human rights
573314 the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago
573315 please insert all the things that we already have in ur amcas such as the classes you took the years when u took it and all the activities that we already have seen in you application
573316 is this really your contact info if so just input ur credit card number here we r not gonna lie to u we sent these to everyone
573317 is is ok that im bsing this essay is it ok that i just fabricated an entire story mostly out of thin air is it ok that i have to lie in order to get into medical school
573318 this is my life now and i was eager to get back to it and i couldnt be happier
573319 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth
573320 the lesson here is that this is what foreign policy ought to be about
573321 although men have higher incidence and mortality from all non sex specific forms of cancer than women the public face of cancer in our study was overwhelmingly female
573322 this imbalance in television reportage of cancer may be distorting political and community perceptions about which cancers are most prevalent and tractable and thereby deserving of government and community support research investment and individual vigilance
573323 for example breast cancer attracts unparalleled research funding from individuals and governments while other cancers causing more disability struggle to gain a fraction of such support
573324 as a former australian health minister commented its not sexy to have testicular or prostate cancer so you dont get a run in the media
573325 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about
573326 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
573327 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities
573328 weve got to get housing right weve got to get education right weve got to get health right but weve also got to get jobs right and thats where corporate australia comes in
573329 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
573330 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
573331 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
573332 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
573333 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
573334 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
573335 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
573336 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
573337 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
573338 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
573339 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
573340 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
573341 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
573342 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
573343 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
573344 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
573345 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
573346 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
573347 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
573348 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
573349 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
573350 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
573351 ser n mero uno es un regalo por el trabajo realizado en el pasado
573352 vamos a expulsar a todas las personas del sur que permanezcan en el rea tur stica del monte kumgang y consideremos innecesarias

573358 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
573359 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are

573365 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
573366 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
573367 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
573368 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
573369 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
573370 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
573371 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
573372 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
573373 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
573374 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
573375 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
573376 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
573377 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
573378 sweet caroline blared through the metrodomes speakers but when the music stopped most fans kept singing as brian bass delivered to david dellucci and they gave themselves an ovation when they finally were done
573379 i thought byrd pitched a pretty good game said twins third base coach scott ullger who filled in for gardenhire
573380 once he got the lead he knew what to do with it
573381 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
573382 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
573383 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
573384 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
573385 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
573386 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
573387 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
573388 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

573550 flip flop criticism put forward by obama and the democrats on thursday when sen
573551 i voted for the 87 billion before i voted against it
573552 it s possible to learn the habits of learning these things don t just happen in high school they need to be slowly learned
573553 the primary years are an academic apprenticeship not only in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy but also bodily skills of application to work and independence in learning it s not about turning kids into homework robots but teaching them to apply themselves to their work
573554 there has been inadequate attention given to the ways educational attainment is founded on embodied capacities such as productive stillness and quiet which are crucial to sustained attention and application in intellectual endeavour
573555 civic and social organizations are teaming with virginia gov timothy m kaine to try to add thousands of nonviolent offenders to the voting rolls in time for the november election a move that has angered republicans who say the effort is designed to help democratic sen barack obama s presidential campaign
573556 this is an astounding moment in american politics you cannot credibly say the clintons are a political dynasty the way say the kennedys or bushs are but i think one has to say the clinton rule of the democratic party has been dynastic bill clinton is the only democrat to have served two terms as president in two generations the only democrat to twice beat republican nominees for president and his wife is a two term u s senator who will likely be in the senate for years to come bill clinton has been rated one of if not the most popular person in the world and yet clinton rule in american politics ends tonight whatever it was the republicans and so many independents did not like about the clintons weve learned the democrats have had enough as well
573557 and thus the democratic party is about to nominate a far left candidate in the tradition of george mcgovern albeit without mcgoverns military and political record the democratic party is about to nominate a far left candidate in the tradition of michael dukakis albeit without dukakiss executive experience as governor the democratic party is about to nominate a far left candidate in the tradition of john kerry albeit without kerrys record of years of service in the senate the democratic party is about to nominate an unvetted candidate in the tradition of jimmy carter albeit without jimmy carters religious integrity as he spoke about it in 1976 questions about all these attributes from foreign policy expertise to executive experience to senatorial experience to judgment about foreign leaders to the instructors he has had in his cultural values surround barack obama and the democratic party has chosen him

573559 he s going to have to try very hard to manage that issue and overcome people s expectations that he s lost a step
573560 what this suggests is that women are under more pressure to get to the top fast men have four additional years before people to expect them to reach their peak performance as leaders but women have to prove themselves more quickly the climb is steeper for them
573561 it doesn t mean plastic surgery is going to be effective in changing expectations for leaders but it does explain why people seek it it s not just vanity age can affect your career and probably more so for women than men
573562 in terms of the election it was right for clinton to emphasize her credentials and experience that helped her what she and her campaign didn t expect was that obama s lack of experience would not be a deficit obama has very little experience but it didn t seem to matter lack of experience for a woman however would likely eliminate her from contention
573563 age is a complicated status characteristic supervisors are seen as gaining value up to a certain age but that prestige and influence seems to reach a maximum at some point and experience cuts both ways the only way to get a lot of experience is to get older so experience is good as long as you don t get too old doing it

573588 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
573589 i forget the exact terminology but the comment was made in terms of her activities now seem to be that shes calmed down and shes in a relationship thats quieted her down and as such she seems to be attracting less attention and theres less activity that the paparazzi all of you are focusing on
573590 a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands
573591 i think there are many things that can be done to avoid that circumstance

573593 if we can get trade flows going again we can inject that much needed economic impetus
573594 this is why the round in itself was so important
573595 with the liberal party youre dealing with not a question of personalities its policies
573596 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices
573597 so on that score i ve got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
573598 be present in everything you do and be engaged with everyone with whom you choose to be with our time here is limited so make every day count

573664 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
573665 detection of liquid ethane confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
573666 the fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated and at a slanted viewing path through titans atmosphere raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument
573667 during the next few years the vast array of lakes and seas on titans north pole mapped with cassinis radar instrument will emerge from polar darkness into sunlight giving the infrared instrument rich opportunities to watch for seasonal changes of titans lakes

573707 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere professor mallavarapu said in a statement
573708 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
573709 you just add the bacteria to the btex contaminated water and they go straight to work prof mallavarapu said
573710 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different he said
573711 we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible

573733 these advances have transformed hiv from being a fatal disease which was the reality for patients before the advent of combination treatment into a long term chronic condition
573734 hiv medication has become much more effective since the early days
573735 there has been great progress but research needs to continue especially for those who have developed resistance to some drugs and are running out of options
573736 hopefully this study will encourage more people to come forward for testing but we need to better educate doctors about the signs and symptoms to look for
573737 society also needs to catch up with the fact that hiv is a long term condition that thousands of people in the uk are living with everyday
573738 hiv is not deserved of the fear or stigma that still surrounds it

573749 we left our homes to save the lives of women and children who came under attack by the bloody hamas gangsters
573750 hamas has once again proven that it is a treacherous party that has a lot of palestinian blood on its hands
573751 whats happening in the gaza strip is a real massacre against innocent people
573752 i cant really complain it was a bit wet and humid out there and i had to be careful in a few spots pretty happy with 6th though its about time i pulled something together i always feel really good in practice but nothing happens in the finals today was a good start i was lucky with some of the other riders having falls and punctures but you have to make your own luck thats downhill last week i rode too conservatively im glad that i put it on the edge a little bit more back to my old self its a bit of a confidence booster i have 2 weeks at whistler now and thats awesome
573753 my run was pretty good i carried really good speed at the top and i didnt use too much energy and was happy i got through the top bits ok i tried to keep it pretty safe through all the sloppy technical stuff because i just wanted to stay upright all the way to the bottom i have no idea how i put on more than 2 seconds at the bottom if anywhere i thought id be faster up top that was pretty surprising

573778 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
573779 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone

573804 we have demonstrated for the first time that it may be possible to arrest the progression of this disease by targeting the tangles which are highly correlated with the disease
573805 we did an analysis of the effect size at 24 weeks and at 50 weeks compared to the average effect size of the current treatments and it was about two and a half times better
573806 this is a major new development in the fight against dementia
573807 it is the first realistic evidence that a new drug can improve cognition in people with alzheimers by targeting the protein tangles that cause brain cell death
573808 this first modestly sized trial in humans is potentially exciting
573809 it suggests the drug could be over twice as effective as any treatment that is currently available
573810 in this exploratory trial rember reduced the decline in blood flow to parts of the brain that are important for memory
573811 this bodes well but we need more human trials to assess the treatments possible side effects

573814 the fact is weve got redistricting coming up in a few years
573815 and if the republicans lose the texas house of representatives because there are a handful of people mad at them and vote for the libertarians instead then we could be in big trouble at the federal level
573816 i told them that republicans need to earn those votes
573817 is this what we want in our pristine valleys of clayoquot sound

573830 they criticized the music the orchestration the libretto and so on it was expected i suppose because celebrities like domingo and kronenberg are involved the snobby side of paris has no choice but to slam us
573831 that outburst was about adjournment the democrats forced a vote to adjourn and we havent done anything about energy prices
573832 this has really been a lot of political posturing in my view because the republicans are using the drilling argument to try to avoid the broader debate about how we get from here to there in a new energy policy
573833 now listen most of my colleagues know that i smoke i know that smokings probably not good for my health most people who smoke in america know its probably not good for their health do we need the federal government to tell us do we need to spend 5 billion of smokers money for the government to tell us that smokings not good for us i dont think so

573837 although men have higher incidence and mortality from all non sex specific forms of cancer than women the public face of cancer in our study was overwhelmingly female
573838 this imbalance in television reportage of cancer may be distorting political and community perceptions about which cancers are most prevalent and tractable and thereby deserving of government and community support research investment and individual vigilance
573839 for example breast cancer attracts unparalleled research funding from individuals and governments while other cancers causing more disability struggle to gain a fraction of such support safety scares
573840 its even better than i thought itd be and i thought it would be good
573841 the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great
573842 that is why i have banned the import of these cats immediately
573843 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
573844 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections
573845 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
573846 difficult to negotiate an accord when unemployment is on the rise and the economy is weakening
573847 a 40 percent decline in price would have put most developing countries into bankruptcy the issue was one of very survival
573848 i hope that if obama gets elected there will be a new commitment to multilateralism
573849 i hope that obama will realise how important multilateralism is and will resume the talks on a more reasonable basis
573850 by having a lot of issues raised in the same forum it is easier to find a compromise
573851 the agreements already in place protect against the most serious problems
573852 you do have a stigma associated with the extended warranty
573853 looks back at paypal after ten years on the internet
573854 a national unity government is the answer if the likud doesnt want to join there are other parties in the knesset and i am certain that they will join a coalition led by me
573855 my ability to form a national unity government a national emergency government is extremely high
573856 governmental stability because israel is facing large existential security challenges
573857 i wouldnt recommend that anyone predict the future on the basis of the polls
573858 it is a matter of the mood and it will change i am certain that i will win the primary
573859 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
573860 some hope that the general election can be waged on the elevated plane that both nominees say they want
573861 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
573862 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
573863 using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues
573864 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
573865 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
573866 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
573867 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
573868 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking sen
573869 pointing out your opponents worldwide celebrity is not the low road and neither is pointing out that he opposes oil drilling and supports higher taxes
573870 my independence hasnt always made me friends in washington i was not elected ms congeniality in the united states senate
573871 my concern with sen obama is that on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
573872 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
573873 you havent heard a positive thing out of that campaign in a month all they do is try to run me down
573874 i think what would be beneficial in the future is to have an additional off site lot within a mile or so
573875 theres only so much parking at cmac the key to less traffic jams is to get people to park at the off site lots
573876 weve had call after call after call saying its ufos
573877 d valos g mez de 29 anos atuava nas farc h 10 anos e era o encarregado da comiss o de seq estros em regi es como o centro e o norte do valle del cauca
573878 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
573879 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
573880 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
573881 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
573882 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
573883 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
573884 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
573885 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
573886 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
573887 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
573888 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
573889 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
573890 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
573891 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
573892 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
573893 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
573894 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
573895 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
573896 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
573897 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
573898 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
573899 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
573900 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
573901 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
573902 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
573903 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
573904 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
573905 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
573906 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
573907 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
573908 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
573909 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
573910 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
573911 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
573912 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
573913 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
573914 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
573915 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
573916 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
573917 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
573918 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
573919 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
573920 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
573921 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
573922 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
573923 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
573924 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
573925 as bullish as we were on the how the numbers would be during the week of the fight it pales in comparison to how well it looks like it will do
573926 so far i am extremely pleased you really dont know for sure yet but certainly it would not be beyond the realm of reasonable possibility we break 500 000 but we will certainly be well over 400 000
573927 are making noble attempts to preserve their natural assets create a user friendly infrastructure and build an economy where their citizens share the benefits of tourist revenue by bringing our commerce to such places we encourage their efforts and inspire neighbouring countries to support these values as well
573928 not only on the field but also in our conditioning test this morming i was probably more impressed with him than any other player just based on todays practice it isnt a solidification of position but he did great today
573929 the expectations are awfully high and we know it the main thing we got to understand is we need to remain humble we are a very humble team but at the same time we are very confident we know that we can go out and compete with the best but we cant act like we can dominate we have to have a swagger but we have to be humble at the same time
573930 hes good pleasant surprise probably beyond what we thought he would be at this point he changes the complexion of our entire team because of his toughness he is softspoken maybe in dealing with you but i think the rest of our team is afraid of him hes physical and i really like having him around
573931 det r en stolt glad och fet spark i r ven p all hund gd
573932 true art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist
573933 back in 04 the olympic teams performance in athens left a great deal to be desired
573934 i had no idea at that moment that i would be asked if i would consider taking over the program but i did have a prerequisite full autonomy
573935 i was aware of how things were structured in the past and i felt we needed to change the culture
573936 with this program weve asked them to be committed to playing for their country and not just to play
573937 these guys have done that over the last two years weve seen this program develop to where whether it be lebron james kobe bryant or jason kidd they feel like theyre part of a team part of a movement and theyre very proud to represent the united states
573938 i think in some respects over the years weve been pretty arrogant saying its our game its not our game its the worlds game and the respect weve shown to international basketball over the last two years will pay dividends
573939 when were with our teams we complain i wish i had chris paul in the backcourt or i wish i had dwight howard
573940 i want this guy i want that guy because we all want to win
573941 well everyone is in the room everyone is here theres no excuses now we have to get the job done
573942 obviously the most talented team without a question in the world
573943 ive learned a lot about these individuals getting to talk with them and look them in the eye
573944 as far as garnett is concerned we never got any positive feedback
573945 it was more about ive been there ive done that its time for someone else to do it
573946 i think we have a unique opportunity right now in representing our country and not just by going for the gold medal in beijing
573947 we can set a standard for how the game should be played right now in our own country with teamwork with camaraderie with enthusiasm with an attention to detail that makes basketball such a great team game
573948 this team is showing all of that hopefully well show it at an even higher level and that will serve as an example for the kids growing up where basketball wont be all about a sound bite or a highlight dunk
573949 theres nothing more important to do for the next 20 minutes
573950 the world faces a global climate emergency it is now clear that only action by both developed and developing countries can prevent the from deepening
573951 the aim is to limit global temperature increases to two degrees above pre industrial levels
573952 the time is right for the countrys private sector to show leadership by partnering with government to develop a solutions driven and adaptation response
573953 the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of mitigating the effects of climate change
573954 our emissions per capita are higher than many other developing countries south africas emissions per capita are also high due to our coal based energy system
573955 make promises to the poor and make deals with the rich
573956 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
573957 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
573958 the tobacco industry has thrived on the business of addiction for decades by turning children into tobacco users with slick marketing tactics and misleading the public about the harms of its deadly products
573959 this bill forces big tobacco to disclose the poisons in its products and has the power to finally break the dangerous chain of addiction for generations to come
573960 children cant vote for members of congress but this bill gives congress a chance to vote for children 4 000 of whom try their first cigarette every day
573961 i asked the congress to lift the legislative ban in june to allow there to be offshore exploration tomorrow is the 1st of august that is now six weeks since i made the request and democratic leaders there havent done anything i members are fixing to go home on their august break they get to explain to their citizens why nothing positive has happened looking forward to listening to the explanations its theres legislation pending in congress to lift the restrictions my call is before you go home for an extended period of time you ought to bring these bills to the floor the leaders ought to be giving these members a vote a chance to say yes or no as to whether or not we ought to be finding more domestic oil to take the pressure off gasoline prices
573962 there were executive restrictions on ocs exploration ive taken them off ive done my part and now the congress needs to do its part
573963 secondly we ought to expand oil production by tapping into oil shale oil shale is out west in the rocky mountain west and that alone if fully recovered equals more than a centurys worth of imports at current levels in other words theres huge potential and theres new technologies that may make this become economically viable the problem is is that theres a provision inserted into law that blocks oil shale leasing on federal lands in other words the federal lands that contain the oil shale you cant lease them and if you cant lease them obviously you cant explore the provision was slipped in it can be slipped out
573964 we ought to be drilling in alaska i told you about the new exploration techniques the new drilling techniques you can have a drilling site that protects the flora and the fauna and explore in ways to get to be doesnt deplete your reservoir unnecessarily in other words we get oil and gas to the pipeline we can drill on a tiny footprint relative to the vast tract of land and its estimated that that would produce about 10 billion barrels of oil now some of the critics say thats not much oil well thats ten billion barrels times current price less money going overseas and staying here in the united states of america
573965 one of the real problems we have is that we havent built a refinery in the united states in 30 years isnt that an interesting statistic its kind of a sad statistic because you probably dont know this but much of the gasoline that we use here in america is imported from overseas we havent built a refinery because theres typically a lot of regulatory burdens and costly litigation and congress can fix it and they ought to fix it i actually asked congress a couple of times to allow for refineries to be built on abandoned military bases and expedite the regulatory process so we can get these refineries up so we can get more gasoline u s produced gasoline into the pumps for u s consumers
573966 supply and demand works and if you got a pinched supply relative to increasing demand youre going to have higher prices we can send a signal to the world that the united states is going to get after these reserves here in the united states of america that were going to have an aggressive policy that respects our environment to take the pressure off international price and we can also relieve pressure on our own gasoline stocks by producing it right here in the united states of america so im talking about a comprehensive plan but it starts with being wise about our own resources and having confidence that technology will enable us to extract those resources that accomplishes several objectives one an efficient way to get the product to market two keeping our money here at home and three protecting the environment and im confident we can do all three
573967 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
573968 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
573969 lay claim to the nation in which they reside and an oversimplified conception of the world in which the antisemite sees
573970 all the persons of the south side we deem unnecessary
573971 take strong military counter actions against even the slightest hostile actions
573972 working hard to lay the blame for the incident at the door of our side
573973 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
573974 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
573975 all signs point to a stability ahead of all else policy
573976 just to be sure nothing bad happens a lot of good things may not happen at the same time
573977 why were the people of wengan so angry as to set fire to government buildings how could a citizen turn so violent after a single regular police interrogation does the removal of an illegal structure have to end up in hatred
573978 the three tragic episodes reveal a less than harmonious relationship between the general public and those who are supposed to be at their service
573979 this incident may appear to be random but in fact it was inevitable
573980 the government only knows this method and they are only good at this method to deal with dissent
573981 may control the situation temporarily but its not the way to solve the problem fundamentally
573982 constantly build a democratic and legal system and let the people have an outlet for the grievances
573983 they told me if they catch me one more time they will take me to a mental hospital
573984 what hasnt changed in china that should worry us wealth authoritarianism and an uncertain future
573985 in the past 30 years china has changed from an economically undeveloped financially poor and isolated in every sense of the word country to a powerhouse of the global economy the worlds number one creditor and a star player in the club of international traders
573986 the most populous country and the third largest economy in the world is in the tight grip of the chinese communist party ccp
573987 the ccp has a total monopoly over political military judicial cultural educational and economic powers as things have been since 1949
573988 what this means is that the past 30 years have seen unprecedented changes in the economic sphere and fundamentally a stand still in the political sphere
573989 the main source of the ccps power lies in its absolute control of chinas huge armed forces
573990 on july 1 2003 half a million hong kong people staged a massive demonstration demanding democracy but across the border not a single word was uttered about it in the chinese press radio or tv
573991 nominally china has its parliament the national peoples congress but its delegates are all appointed by the ccp
573992 the majority of the delegates are party and government officials the rest are celebrities such as film stars olympic medallists prominent academics or successful businessmen
573993 these include banking and finance energy oil natural gas electricity air rail and sea transportation telecommunication war industry and defence projects and the very lucrative tobacco industry
573994 of fortune magazines top 500 global companies 15 are chinese companies and they are without exception all state owned ones
573995 cctv cameras are installed in internet cafes and even school classrooms
573996 in the southern boom town of shenzhen 200 000 surveillance cameras have been installed and over the next three years as many as 2 million will be installed in that city
573997 and these cameras will be linked with other forms of surveillance the internet phones facial recognition software and gps monitoring to form an ambitious nation wide surveillance plan called golden shield
573998 when this project is completed chinese citizens will be watched and listened to around the clock
573999 china will become a super police state george orwells nineteen eighty four will prove to be lacking in imagination
574000 the chinese word for country or state is composed of the two ideograms of guo and jia meaning state and family
574001 china is ruled like a family where the rulers are parents and the people are infants as father know best the rulers make decisions for the people from what they are allowed to know to how many children a couple may have namely one
574002 the people have no civil rights no freedom of speech or assembly and their participation in public affairs is tightly controlled
574003 the trouble with paternalistic authoritarianism is that the rulers are not genuine parents of the people consequently the rulers will not genuinely and sincerely be concerned with the welfare of the people as genuine parents are with the welfare of their children
574004 instead with unaccountable power in their hands chinas rulers have without exception been corrupt bleeding the people dry to accumulate fortunes for their own families ccp officials have set a new record of personal wealth accumulation at the expense of the people
574005 the morality of revolution that the end justifies the means becomes a morality that justifies corruption
574006 of the 3 200 mainland chinese whose personal wealth exceeds 100 million chinese yuan us 18 million 2 932 or over 90 per cent are adult children of top chinese leaders
574007 paternalistic rule is supposed to contain leadership by moral example but this element is sadly lacking in the chinese version of paternalistic authoritarianism today as the ccp is woefully deficient in morality
574008 an inspirational example of fast economic development under an undemocratic political system
574009 the ccp is also an active and often the sole significant supporter of despots from kim jong il of north korea to robert mugabe of zimbabwe it is safe to say that in todays world scratch the surface of any dictator and you will find the ccp nearby
574010 of the two the latter is more significant as radical islamism furious and destructive as it may be is totally unattractive to most people and therefore does not offer a realistic alternative to liberal democracy
574011 authoritarian superpowers are attractive to many people and its replacement of liberal democracy is a real possibility
574012 should this replacement take place it would mark a serious setback of humankinds quest for human dignity and a fair and humane way of organising societies
574013 they form a monitoring interface so that as soon as illegal cars hit the street they will be discovered
574014 the training of the sailing athletes was influenced by the algae but it never stopped and now their training is back to normal
574015 the local government bused several thousand students and office workers into a public square and lined them up in front of a vocational school
574016 as the spectators watched witnesses said three prisoners were brought out
574017 then an execution squad fired rifles at the three point blank killing them on the spot
574018 especially as the beijing olympic games draw near a range of anti china forces and hostile forces are striving by any means and redoubling efforts to engage in troublemaking and sabotage
574019 according to preliminary investigations the explosions were cases of man made deliberate sabotage
574020 the bomb is the weapon of choice in china while private guns are rare explosives are readily available for mining or construction and the range of angry or opportunistic attackers spans the spectrum from gangsters to muslim guerrillas to jilted lovers though china doesnt release statistics state media suggest the number of bombings is on the rise
574021 it has to have something to do with the general lack of availability of guns and the availability of something else
574022 even though public security authorities have ruled that dangerous explosives should be manufactured kept and disposed of by selected persons economic development has made them widely available
574023 six people were killed on the spot and another five died in hospital
574024 the general mobilisation of ants i hope citizens receiving this message will not take bus lines 54 64 and 84 tomorrow morning
574025 it is really strange did he really want to warn us
574026 if you receive this message please dont take bus route 54 64 or 84
574027 there has been no evidence so far to show that the incident is related to the upcoming beijing olympics
574028 we have obtained information that international terrorist organisations would likely launch an attack against an olympic venue in the city during the games
574029 we have staged raids and cracked a group of terrorists
574030 according to information we have obtained the olympic venue athletes apartments and routes leading to the venue are at a safe level now
574031 spare no effort to maintain law and order in the city
574032 we have obtained information that international terrorist organisations would likely launch an attack against an olympic venue in the city during the games
574033 we have staged raids and cracked a group of terrorists
574034 according to information we have obtained the olympic venue athletes apartments and routes leading to the venue are at a safe level now
574035 spare no effort to maintain law and order in the city
574036 we have been trying our best to help reporters to cover the beijing olympics
574037 breaking through a barricade set up to control a ticket buying crowd and kicking a policeman in the groin
574038 we would like to express our sympathy to the injured policeman
574039 more vehicles could go off the roads and all construction sites and some more factories in beijing and its neighbouring areas could be closed temporarily if the capitals air quality deteriorates during the olympic games
574040 the measures will be put into place if air quality turns out to be short of the standards we have promised
574041 for us the athletes attitude to the event is paramount
574042 beijing has also missed a golden opportunity in using the games as a platform to implement more ambitious initiatives
574043 more vehicles could go off the roads and all construction sites and some more factories in beijing and its neighbouring areas could be closed temporarily if the capitals air quality deteriorates during the olympic games
574044 the measures will be put into place if air quality turns out to be short of the standards we have promised
574045 sports teams from the various countries have reason to be concerned
574046 in the event pm10 conditions cannot meet with national standards and who standards then there are reasons for different parties to suggest that certain events be delayed
574047 beijing has also missed a golden opportunity in using the games as a platform to implement more ambitious initiatives
574048 the organisation is extremely resilient and its influence although limited to southern xinjiang seems to be growing
574049 the prison authorities are also worried about the influence of hizbut followers on other inmates
574050 for most uighurs who are activists though some of them are very religious in their islam their main goal is sovereignty for xinjiang hizb ut tahrir doesnt support that they support a worldwide caliphate not any one independent region
574051 this does not exist they have come up with this groups name themselves
574052 they are trying to mislead the world and deflect from concern for the uighur people
574053 hizb ut tahrir and muslim voices that do not toe the government line have been severely oppressed by the chinese government
574054 it is well known across the world that since its founding in 1953 hizb ut tahrir has exclusively engaged in non violent political and intellectual work
574055 proactively carrying out extremist religious activities and promoting jihad establishing a terrorist training base and preparing to set up an islamic caliphate
574056 by linking the unrest to hizb ut tahrir theres legal cause for suggesting that these individuals were involved in a transnational conspiracy to set up an islamic state and destabilise china
574057 its not clear that the civil unrest had any of those goals in mind
574058 be very clear about the islamic liberation partys reactionary nature
574059 be very clear about their pervasive and actual threat to xinjiang and kashgar
574060 its certainly disappointing if thats the case from an ioc point of view that was a commitment for hosting these games
574061 i would think that fellow australian ioc member kevan gosper in particular as chairman of the media commission and ioc president jacques rogge will be having serious discussions with the chinese authorities on this today
574062 i thought it was a key plank that is important to have transparency particularly during the games time and so that is a matter that the ioc will take seriously
574063 it may well be like when they broke the news to the president of the ioc one night that were going to have the equestrian in hong kong
574064 some things im not sure you can do anything about but well see
574065 i have heard that there are some limitations on access said mr gosper
574066 i will speak with the chinese authorities to advise them of the restraints and to see what their reaction is
574067 our promise was that journalists would be able to use the internet for their work during the olympic games said mr sun
574068 so we have given them sufficient access to do that
574069 evil cult and many of its members have been detained amid claims that hundreds have died in custody due to torture abuse and neglect
574070 recently i have also been advised that some of the ioc officials had negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked
574071 if you have been misled by what i have told you about there being free internet access during the games then i apologise
574072 the ioc holds regular discussions with bocog on providing the media with the kind of internet access and facilities they need to report on the games
574073 it might be false or misleading to call it a barbecue said olympic boss john coates beforehand
574074 we are not able to cook meat outside the dining room normally we can get them to cook it for us but this will be a barbecue with cold meats and salad
574075 its obviously a tactic by them to snatch a few medals off us one australian athlete said
574076 we didnt ban them from eating rice at the sydney games
574077 this is clearly the best village we have ever had the dining room the residents centre are simply outstanding coates said
574078 with the use of modern technology the control is tighter than china ever had before
574079 this is an exercise of state power peoples rights are heavily violated is this an olympics or some kind of warfare
574080 the original idea was to invite the international community to china share the same values celebrate humanity and goodwill to speak about peace and social harmony but today you see police everywhere in every neighbourhood there is tight security not just in beijing but everywhere in china people really live in a police state
574081 my fathers generation fought and lost for ideology many of them lost their lives because they wanted a just society but now we put up with shit like this
574082 to me it is not a choice of whether or not to speak out it is a matter of dignity of life
574083 from whatever direction you look at it you share the power there is no decoration the concept looks simple but it provides the best watching experience for everybody because there are no pillars
574084 i dont criticise the stadium i criticise the governments use of the olympics for propaganda i am disappointed that the system is not able to turn this historical event into political reform
574085 i have become more political after the article in the guardian last year when he first dissociated himself from the games i have become the only person who can speak out if i dont there will be total silence
574086 i speak out because i trust chinese people and also because i trust people in government want to make a better society i dont see them as enemies
574087 this year people both inside and outside the party have understood the problems more clearly it is so obvious that it cannot go on any more there is much more talk about the need to be open
574088 it looks like china is becoming more distant from the rest of the world but actually it is becoming closer before we lacked communication and it seemed everything was all right but the olympics is a wonderful thing for china it shows all the problems the chinese government are very willing to learn from it
574089 to show your weakness is power you dont need to pretend no one is perfect in this world telling people the old system is not working is not shameful we all know that
574090 it is the same for the outside world for a long time there was a lack of communication so there are a lot of cliches about china that are outdated but before they find something else they can relate to they have nothing else to use
574091 i am sure some journalists agree with me but they know it cannot be published
574092 when anybody is denied freedom of expression it is a loss for the whole society

574114 matt and is relationship was on blast from the beginning and thats one thing that ripped us apart im used to the hollywood bs but it really got into matts head
574115 after he moved to l a and saw her constantly partying and clubbing he realized that she wasnt behaving like a woman who was ready to be in a serious relationship
574116 shayne seemed more interested in getting publicity and being part of the hollywood scene than she was in the relationship
574117 i did not cheat on matt i would never ever cheat on matt he was my fiance
574118 i want to clear this up 100 that vegas trip had nothing to do with our break up i was in vegas with friends matt and i had already broken up i was a single 22 year old woman having fun

574137 not typical conservatives we want a representative of the conservative point of view someone like larry kudlow or ramesh ponnuru
574138 george w bush is not qualified to be president and we should be really worried about this
574139 i supported bush in 2000 but george w bush is not listening to his honest conservative policy advisers and we should be really worried about this
574140 i supported bush in 2000 and 2001 but 911 has unhinged the administration its detention and other policies are counterproductive it needs to be opposed
574141 i supported bush over 2000 2002 but enough is enough thats it i supported the invasion of iraq because i was certain there was evidence of an advanced nuclear weapons program otherwise invading iraq was just stupid well there was no advanced nuclear weapons program invading iraq was just stupid plus theres the medicare drug benefit these people need to be evicted from power
574142 ive been a bush supporter im a republican and a conservative but ive had enough im voting for kerry
574143 i voted for bush in 2004 but i made a mistake a big mistake
574144 i know i supported bush up to last year but that shows im not the brightest light on the clued in tree
574145 whether the state department was running its security program well or poorly
574146 show that there was some evidence that an employee was a security or loyalty risk present
574147 in most of his cases mccarthy adduced persuasive evidence the state departments efforts stood condemned and the screams of red scare were efforts to occlude the truth
574148 mccarthy was in a business that permitted a certain latitude
574149 mccarthys record is not only much better than his critics allege but given his metier extremely good
574150 should not be remembered as the man who didnt produce 57 communist party cards but as the man who brought public pressure to bear on the state department to revise its practices and to eliminate from responsible positions flagrant security risks
574151 special contribution challeng ing the liberals claim to the moral high ground buckley and bozell faced and rejected the argument that mccarthyism was in its very essence evil because it was an effort at censorship and thought control its essence they argued was to defend liberty from communism
574152 without any encouragement and coordination from us other than a public speech by the president that kind of thing on the public record
574153 the united states government has not done anything to facilitate the activities of these private groups
574154 18 months is a very very long time to spend on the question whether esther brunauer was ever a member of the joint anti fascist refugee league
574155 did mccarthy present enough evidence to raise reasonable doubt as to whether all loyalty and security risks had been removed from the state department
574156 guilty of a number of exaggerations some of them reckless they are reprehensible
574157 mccarthys record is not only much better than his critics allege but given his metier extremely good
574158 should not be remembered as the man who didnt produce 57 communist party cards but as the man who brought public pressure to bear on the state department to revise its practices and to eliminate from responsible positions flagrant security risks
574159 not only is it characteristic of societies to create institutions and to defend themselves with sanctions societies must do so or else they cease to exist
574160 we cannot avoid the fact that the united states is at war against international communism and that mccarthyism is a program of action against those in our land who help the enemy mccarthyism is nine parts social sanction to one part legal sanction but that one part legal sanction is legitimate
574161 with his easily erupting temper his menacing monotone his unsmiling mien and his perpetual shadow he did seem the perfect stock villain
574162 your book makes it plain that there was a need for investigation ten years ago
574163 who are sympathetic with his cause must deplore his championship of it
574164 why have we focused attention on the record of senator mccarthy
574165 because it is predictable that if mccarthys enemies are successful in discrediting him the mobilization will lose momentum and perhaps grind to a dead halt
574166 in a terror that senator mccarthy will one day make some irreparable blunder which will discredit the whole anti communist effort for a long while to come

574178 command economy however sophisticated and flexible cannot begin to replace the myriad rapid mutual adjustments of functioning markets and the price system
574179 had to be imposed by a coercive state in the nineteenth century as karl polanyi has convincingly shown
574180 such right wing critics of the command economy as friedrich hayek and such left wing critics of communist authoritarianism as price peter kropotkin
574181 more reverence for life less straitjacketing of the future more allowance for the unexpected less wishful thinking
574182 political economy announces the unknowability for the sovereign of the totality of economic processes and as a consequence the impossibility of an economic sovereignty
574183 put bluntly my bill of particulars against the high modernist centrally planning social engineering state is by no means a case for politically unfettered market coordination as urged by friedrich hayek or milton friedman as we shall see the conclusions that can be drawn from the failures of modern projects of social engineering are as applicable to market driven standardization as they are to bureaucratic homogeneity
574184 understanding the history and logic of their commitment to high modernist goals however does not permit us to overlook the enormous damage that their convictions entailed when combined with authoritarian state power

574239 derrida is the greatest and most exciting thinker of the 20th century derrida is in many respects very conservative one must start from that conservatism in order to measure the ways in which he is radical can seem highly radical to thinkers who are attempting to graft derrida into a tradition in which many of derridas key reference points have historically been marginal how much does that affect the way you read a sentence where someone asks to have a button undone probably not much
574240 this polarizing personalizing rhetoric indicates that social constructionism has an institutional basis not a philosophical moral or political one it tramples on philosophical distinctions and practices an immoral mode of debate though it declares a political goal for criticism it is not a political stance herein lies the secret of constructionisms success it is the school of thought most congenial to current professional workplace conditions of scholars in the humanities
574241 i liked theory even when i felt i didnt have the faintest idea what was going on because if nothing else you could sense the energy behind it
574242 the older philosophical critics jameson suggests lacked hegelian seriousness in place of an aggressive commitment to the consequences of their premises they were content to simply muse about literature in an occasional way his sinecured dilettanti mass produced curiosities of an existential or phenomenological criticism or a hegelian or a gestalt or indeed a freudian criticism burke empson et al avoided indenture in the curiosity trade jameson argues by processing literature in accordance with a personal interpretive ethos one resonant with a nonsystemized theory nonetheless compulsively applied in a rage for symmetry jamesons notion of a virtuoso critic of the good camp can be summed up thus a thinker of original temperament but suitable hegelian seriousness whose passion for patterns generates interesting reading of literary works his notion of a virtouso critic of the bad calicified mind learned but unoriginal and philosophically fickle whose passions for other peoples patterns generates predictable readings of literary works
574243 i apologize for heideggers highly convoluted and neologistic prose i imagine that some readers are already thinking come back derrida all is forgiven in heideggers reading we could say that the discovery of neptune in 1846 could plausibly be described from a strictly human vantage point as the invention of neptune b efore we began to look for it the planet neptune simply did not exist in any human consciousness and yet once humans had invented neptune they understood it as a thing not susceptible to mere human invention

574253 it is tempting to blame cleon for the breaking off of the negotiations
574254 this is a camp in which you have to use caution
574255 you have to be smart in how you use players both in how many reps they get and how much contact there is what we try to do is distribute the reps so nobody gets too sore
574256 you have to get in shape so theres going to be some aches in pains but we have to be very careful not to put a player whos tired in a stressful situation youve got to find a way to get them prepared without risking injuries
574257 our goal is the same to get mentally and physically tough enough for the regular season
574258 youre never as far along as youd like to be but i feel good about where we are the changes in camp scheduling weve made have been good with more guys upright
574259 weve got a kicker and a punter we trust theyre workers if we didnt feel so good about them wed have to bring in somebody to push them a little
574260 very conscious of how much im kicking you dont want to over kick but youve got to get your work in mostly im kicking just in the morning now on days when i have to kick at both practices i scale back
574261 i kicked more my first few years in the league because i had a lot to learn
574262 and i kicked more than i would have liked last year because it was a competition against chad stanley whom he beat out now i work smarter i just work on what i need to work on
574263 whether i have another guy in camp with me or not i dont treat it different im going to challenge myself every day anyway i know what i need to do
574264 i like to focus on what im doing without any distractions i dont like to share reps any reps you get are valuable
574265 when they tell you how good they feel physically compared to other years thats a good sign

574272 impulsar la resoluci n 125 y pidi desdramatizar sobre cleto cobos
574273 la permanencia o no de un funcionario depende de si se desempe a honestamente o laboriosamente y ese es un resorte exclusivo del presidente de la naci n e s la presidenta por un gobierno republicano la que decide su permanencia o no
574274 en los pa ses vecinos donde los salarios son menores a los de la argentina se registran precios de alimentos mayores y la inflaci n sin embargo da menos
574275 la constituci n es muy clara al respecto hay que desdramatizar cada uno es responsable de las acciones pol ticas que realiza cuando uno toma una decisi n pol tica eval a las consecuencias no me corresponde adjetivar sobre las decisiones del vicepresidente
574276 firm tres renuncias en mi vida la de vicepresidenta de la c mara de diputados la de senadora en 1997 para encabezar la lista de diputados en santa cruz y despu s cuando iba a asumir como presidenta
574277 ustedes se preguntar n si volver a a impulsar la resoluci n 125 y yo dir a que s porque creo que por primera vez desde el advenimiento de le democracia las instituciones el poder ejecutivo y el parlamento nos hemos puesto a discutir en serio una ley que por primera vez tocaba el tema de la redistribuci n del ingreso son discusiones que hay que despojarlas de un sesgo ideol gico cuando se personaliza demasiado una discusi n no se quiere abordar el n cleo del problema cuando debatamos estos temas no hay que personalizar
574278 nunca se vio desde la democracia tanto nivel de virulencia de lock out patronal de corte de rutas eso no fue por parte del gobierno no vi a ning n funcionario cortando rutas no vi gente que pudiera compartir la pol tica del gobierno amenazando a quienes pudieran votar en contra de lo que pensaban el gobierno tom una resoluci n en las facultades que le competen constitucionalmente se puede no estar de acuerdo de hecho as sucedi pero para eso se recurre al parlamento como hice yo o a la justicia el gobierno jam s tom una acci n que pudiera desencadenar hechos de violencia
574279 mi autocr tica es la ingenuidad que tuve frente a la reacci n de los sectores chicos num ricamente pero muy poderosos econ micamente tuvimos la posibilidad de debatir un proyecto de distribuci n de la riqueza en serio y cuando uno ve la pel cula completa ve que los que se beneficiaron con el resultado fueron los sectores exportadores no los peque os y medianos productores
574280 es curioso c mo cuando uno vio algunas votaciones sectores que siempre se han ubicado en el campo progresista finalmente terminaron votando intereses diferentes sobre todo porque era la primera oportunidad hist rica de discutir democr ticamente un proyecto de redistribuci n del ingreso en serio cuando era senadora siempre presentaban proyectos a la izquierda de todo el todo el mundo tal vez porque sab an que no lo bamos a poder tratar pero esas son observaciones an lisis lecciones que no solamente las debo hacer yo sino toda la sociedad cuando mira a sus representantes
574281 creo que el hecho de que no apoyen proyectos que los benefician tiene que ver con no comprender un modelo econ mico pero eso no es s lo atribuible a la clase media sino a toda la sociedad hay que ver que nuestros progresos personales y econ micos tienen que ver con adem s del esfuerzo y el talento individual un modelo econ mico que nos permite ese desarrollo muchas veces sto no es visto tampoco por las clases m s altas hubo sectores que apoyaron determinadas interrupciones pol ticas e institucionales que finalmente sufrieron la destrucci n de sus industrias
574282 debo ser sincera como en todas mis actitudes de vida volver a a hacer todas y cada una de las cosas que hice
574283 en 2003 los comentarios eran que esta se ora era la que iba a mandar a decidir porque en realidad kirchner era un pelele que iba a ser manejado o por el ex presidente o por su mujer suced a eso porque l era desconocido en buenos aires y yo muy conocida as que ahora es una inversi n ahora yo soy d bil manejable pusil nime pero no es cierta ninguna de las dos historias
574284 es muy dif cil que los resultados de una encuesta no coincidan con la l nea editorial de un diario nosotros tenemos encuestas diferentes a las de el diario la naci n no hay ning n problema me encanta la gente que piensa diferente pero perm tanme relativizar las encuestas porque si uno recuerda las elecciones las encuestas dec an que hab a segunda vuelta y ganamos por mas de 23 puntos la diferencia m s importante en la historia de la democracia
574285 hoy me enter por los medios que la ltima conferencia fue en 1999 quiere decir que todo aquello que hab amos o do se debe a un error de informaci n parece ser que no s lo el anterior presidente no dio conferencias de prensa
574286 vamos por la historia del sistema ferroviario en la argentina sabemos que hab a sido devastado ramal que para ramal que cierra estamos haciendo una gran inversi n para el tren bala no se extrae dinero del ambito ferroviario no se saca un solo centavo del presupuesto nacional para este tren creo que el tren bala ser importante es financiado absolutamente por la empresa que lo construye este tema tiene como limitante el tema de la tarifa que se cobra si el boleto fuera de 3 4 pesos ser a m s facil pero tenemos que equilibrar las posibilidades del usuario si vas a londres viaj s fant stico pero pagas cinco libras por doce cuadras
574287 siempre esa agenda del bicentenario estuvo abierta para todos los sectores econ micos y sociales que articulan lo que debe ser un nuevo modelo m s all de las adjetivaciones lo importante es tener en cuenta que la unidad no pasa por la homogeneidad sino en poder articular un modelo de reindustrializaci n el gran desaf o de todos los sectores es generar un modelo que agregando valor siga dando trabajo a los argentinos mejorando el salario e incorporando tecnolog a sin lugar a dudas est n todos convocados sin temor al debate
574288 hemos mantenido m ltiples reuniones con distintas entidades si uno analiza la actual ley de radiodifusi n uno ve que se hizo durante la dictadura cuando lo m s moderno era la televisi n a color ni siquiera hab a fax creo que la argentina requiere de un instrumento que de cuenta de preparar el marco regulatorio para la incorporaci n de la tecnolog a la comunicaci n es el rea que ha dado el salto mas importante en materia de innovaci n tecnol gica y nuestra idea es convocar o seguir convocando para trabajar en una nueva ley
574289 el banco central se maneja de manera aut noma no hay un tipo de cambio presidencial debe seguir manej ndose en la forma en que se ha venido manejando ya que ha permitido acumulaci n de reservas y le ha dado solidez a todo el sistema financiero nacional
574290 es in dita la presencia de una delegaci n como la que acompa a al presidente lula en la argentina este fin de semana lo cual revela la firme convicci n de lula y m a de integraci n y la importancia de argentina como un lugar para inversiones por su competitividad en la ronda de doha tuvimos posturas diferentes con brasil cuando uno compara lo que ponen los pa ses desarrollados frente a nosotros no suena a buen negocio para los pa ses emergentes en el caso de argentina nos colocaba en una posici n muy dif cil es muy importante para la integraci n tambi n la presencia de venezuela y tiene que ver con esta ecuaci n energ tica alimentos e industria hay que adoptar pol ticas de estado permanentes
574291 el club de par s es un tema que nos ocupa
574292 es parte de un prestigio de la argentina muy fuerte uno lo puede observar cuando viaja al exterior la rep blica argentina es mirada como ejemplar por el respeto irrestricto a los derechos humanos si tengo que hablar con sinceridad me gustar a que no nos tuvieran que admirar por eso pero lo cierto es que estamos cumpliendo con una deuda no solamente con la argentina sino con un modo de ver y vivir que se debe universalizar
574293 me acuerdo que al segundo d a de gesti n sucedi lo de la valija y dec an que antonini wilson tra a dinero para mi campa a hoy la relaci n es como siempre normal y seria como debe ser con todos los pa ses del mundo no deber a pronunciarme acerca de esas cosas pero que hoy sea candidato un hombre de color como el senador barack obama revela por parte del pueblo una vitalidad sorprendente y admirable revela una cabeza muy abierta m s all de los resultados es admirable que est compitiendo por uno de los dos partidos m s importantes del pa s un hombre de color
574294 cuando recib en mi despacho a thomas shannon subsecretario de estado de asuntos hemisf ricos me asegur que la presencia de la cuarta flota no obedec a a ninguna circunstancia que tuviera que ver con los recursos naturales creo que todo sto confluye en lo que nosotros consideramos un nuevo modelo de defensa regional que debemos abordar con todos los pa ses de am rica del sur no de car cter ofensivo sino de car cter defensivo de dar se ales muy claras del modelo de acumulaci n que es lo que ha movido a much simos empresarios a radicarse aqu
574295 ning n inversor tiene en cuenta a un pa s cuyo gobierno no tiene orientaci n los que lo apoyamos no tenemos por qu dejarnos llevar por una conducci n que no se entiende
574296 arreglar el indec es f cil lo dif cil es combatir la inflaci n y para eso hacen falta algunos cambios de pol tica
574297 yo no s por qu no abren el di logo
574298 hacen falta m s cambios en el gabinete y que los funcionarios empiecen a hacer lo que propon an antes de las elecciones de octubre porque se est dejando pasar demasiado tiempo
574299 y no podemos tener una pareja gobernando eso erosiona la figura presidencial
574300 entendemos que la baja del tipo de cambio es coyuntural
574301 se ve que muy convencidos del modelo no estaban porque a la primera de cambio lo abandonaron
574302 estamos agotando una pol tica de precios autoritaria e in til que arranc en 2006
574303 echar a todos los que nos llevaron a esta situaci n
574304 los que lo apoyamos esta pol tica no tenemos por qu dejarnos llevar por una conducci n que no se entiende hacen falta m s cambios en el gabinete y no podemos tener una pareja gobernando porque eso erosiona la figura presidencial hay una enorme incertidumbre sobre el rumbo del modelo econ mico guillermo moreno encarna muchos de los problemas que hay que corregir para retomar la senda del crecimiento
574305 estamos agotando una pol tica de precios autoritaria e in til que arranc en 2006 la situaci n argentina es grav sima haya o no una crisis financiera en los pa ses ricos lo que hay que hacer es echar no s lo a moreno sino a todos los que nos llevaron a esta situaci n y es muy importante evitar la apreciaci n de la moneda baja del d lar que surge del ingreso de flujos financieros
574306 arreglar el indec es f cil lo dif cil es combatir la inflaci n porque para eso hacen falta algunos cambios de pol tica sanear el instituto de estad sticas es simplemente una decisi n del gobierno que puede concretarse convocando gente de prestigio y retomando el di logo a m no me llamaron para esa tarea a pesar de todo lo que se dijo y se escribi y yo no s por qu no abren el di logo
574307 se enuncian el n mero de plazas de primaria pero no se dice si son para el primer a o o el quinto tampoco se dice en qu escuelas est n esas plazas vacantes

574309 la convocatoria no define el perfil docente qu significa que un maestro de los que van a presentar el examen saque 10 qu tipo de maestro es es el que los padres de familia queremos

574320 the world faces a global climate emergency it is now clear that only action by both developed and developing countries can prevent the climate crisis from deepening
574321 the aim is to limit global temperature increases to two degrees above pre industrial levels
574322 the time is right for the countrys private sector to show leadership by partnering with government to develop a solutions driven national climate change mitigation and adaptation response
574323 the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of mitigating the effects of climate change
574324 our emissions per capita are higher than many other developing countries south africas emissions per capita are also high due to our coal based energy system

574339 incluso la c pula de la iglesia se est metiendo en cosas pol ticas que tiene prohibido como decir que sta constituci n es demasiado estatista
574340 qu pena que la conferencia episcopal ecuatoriana no haya dicho con igual vigor que la constituci n que tenemos ahora es privatizadora
574341 en general no puede hacer lo que est haciendo no vengan con cuentos que est n catequizando
574342 hay esa iglesia comprometida con los pobres y hay tambi n esa iglesia comprometida con los ricos
574343 pero coment correa saben qui n pidi eso la conferencia episcopal ecuatoriana se lo podemos demostrar ellos pidieron a la asamblea que se reconozcan las uniones de hecho de las personas del mismo sexo
574344 no s si cambiaron de opini n o es una estrategia electoral
574345 la situaci n actual es que ni el regreso de los refugiados palestinos ni la formaci n del gobierno palestino e incluso el colapso del r gimen sionista son un objetivo imposible

574430 reforma agraria integral y soberan a alimentaria que es la posibilidad de que el pa s tenga su propio proyecto alimentario y no que las multinacionales impongan qu se debe producir
574431 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales

574434 el campo profundo reclama tierra que no se destruya m s el medio ambiente agua y reclama pol ticas para frenar el xodo hacia las ciudades y todo esto no depende de las retenciones depende de pol ticas reales que ning n gobierno impulsa
574435 la faa no dice que sus afiliados con la complicidad del sistema pol tico y jur dico desalojan campesinos y sinceremos que esos productores no cosechan alimentos en beneficio del pueblo producen forrajes para la especulaci n en el mercado externo

574443 el actual tipo de cambio el boom de la soja y las forestales desplazaron a la ganader a desde el litoral y la pampa hacia esta provincia las empresas donde tambi n est n las mineras intentan por todos los medios apropiarse de tierras y agua comprando fraguando t tulos usurpando y prometiendo un progreso que son mentiras
574444 reforma agraria integral y soberan a alimentaria que es la posibilidad de que el pa s tenga su propio proyecto alimentario y no que las multinacionales impongan qu se debe producir
574445 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales
574446 el gobierno provincial alienta cuatro polos productivos la industria del az car y el tabaco el turismo y la miner a todas ellas atentan contra nuestros territorios y nuestra forma de vida
574447 repudiamos las pol ticas de exclusi n y saqueo de los territorios en que vivimos pol ticas promovidas por los grupos econ micos que tienen como c mplices a los gobiernos de turno
574448 el campo profundo reclama tierra que no se destruya m s el medio ambiente agua y reclama pol ticas para frenar el xodo hacia las ciudades y todo esto no depende de las retenciones depende de pol ticas reales que ning n gobierno impulsa
574449 la faa no dice que sus afiliados con la complicidad del sistema pol tico y jur dico desalojan campesinos y sinceremos que esos productores no cosechan alimentos en beneficio del pueblo producen forrajes para la especulaci n en el mercado externo
574450 esas cuatro patronales no nos representan pero tampoco el gobierno que nos ha fallado nos abandon

574466 penchuleo representa para nosotros un nuevo tipo de liderazgo es un joven mapuche de la zona que ha destacado como dirigente universitario y cuya elecci n como candidato fue producto de un proceso de primarias in dito entre las comunidades de la zona

574469 ambas candidaturas se han formalizado bajo la modalidad de independientes y eso nos exige trabajar el doble
574470 lamentablemente el servel aun no nos autoriza iniciar la campa a de firmas para legalizarnos y esto nos ha perjudicado sin embargo estas municipales nos dar n la oportunidad de seguir socializando nuestra propuesta pol tica a nivel de base y preparando el terreno para cuando demos el vamos a la campa a que esperamos sea el segundo semestre
574471 lautaro y freire son comunas de alta poblaci n mapuche y donde est n las bases fundadoras del partido lo que esperamos con estas candidaturas es acrecentar adem s nuestra base de militantes y posicionar a wallmapuwen de cara a nuestra campa a de legalizaci n ambas comunas son emblem ticas para nosotros y esperamos que al igual como sucede hoy con luis penchuleo en lautaro sigan surgiendo desde las comunidades liderazgos j venes que refresquen la pol tica mapuche y constituyan un real aporte a nuestro pueblo
574472 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
574473 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n

574502 for women who are survivors of mens violence perhaps most notably for incest and rape surviviors the shift feminism enables from individual pathology to systematic analysis is empowering rather than threatening
574503 according to the older texts which are sacred that is power engendering thought womean is not a passive personage her potentiallity is dynamic and unimaginably powerful she brought corn and agriculture potting weaving social systems religion ceremony ritual buliding memory intuition and their experssions in language creativity dance human to animal relations and she gave these offerings power and authority and blessed the people with the ability to provide for themselves and their progeny
574504 and as the cultures that are woman centered and mother ritual based are also cultures that value peacefulness harmony cooperation health and general prosperity they are systems of thought and practice that would bear deeper study in our troubles conflict ridden time
574505 when i was younger years ago anybody could get on welfare and i think thats whats good abut welfare reform i think some people on welfare are bing greedy taking away from people that are homeless people that are homeless people that really need the help i mean there are truly people out there living at the salvation army i hear tell that there are people who cant get in those shelters because theyre so full and i think thats the sad part about it those women that dont really need welfare shouldnt be taking money away from the homeless

574517 the present person is a lot of fun so who cares
574518 it is those questions that separate us from other shows like dukes of hazard or baywatch its the message received on star trek that distinguishes us from even other science fiction shows
574519 i feel good so i think ill be out there
574520 i think its too early to be able to separate yet because we havent had any game action
574521 nobody has jumped ahead of the other guys in the live action or the drills significantly enough to say its a 1 2 3 weve all got our opinions but one thing is for certain theyve all gotten better
574522 i cant say he wont work against the patriots right now
574523 willis wants to participate willis wants to play well see how next week unfolds and how he works and is running around
574524 if hes doing things to our expectations and his then i believe willis wants to play in this game its a new offense new coaching staff new head coach with the excitement and aura around here i believe he will play in this ball game
574525 i need to get out there but ive been doing a lot of chalk talks and trying to take those mental notes
574526 it hurts not to be out there i just want to get back as soon as possible but i dont know when thats going to be
574527 we developed a plan to condense such a deal into one homestand
574528 we might eventually meet in the euroleague or uleb cup or some games during the week
574529 but typically on saturday and sunday you play in your country
574530 like on sunday i will have a game in italy and on tuesday or wednesday i will play teams from spain greece russia so you never know we might meet
574531 after playing in some camps and playing alongside some of the guys in the nba i know i can play at that level
574532 its just the matter of the right fit situation and time
574533 they know what i can do and if they need me they know where im at across the big pond
574534 i think you will continue to see it happen because guys want to play and get the money they deserve
574535 in europe those fans treat you great a lot of people know soccer is big but basketball is huge too
574536 its good basketball as you can see in the olympics so i think guys are seeing how good the talent is and are deciding to go work on their games over there rather than sit the bench in the nba
574537 once they learn how to play the right way the wilmington basketball way which is not like every other university because we work harder than everybody else they will be successful

574543 having to increase mileage reimbursements rightly so to our staff is a challenge given that we are living with static or diminishing reimbursements from the payers who pay for our service
574544 i know for a fact that if i didnt have the nurses i wouldnt be able to live at home and my quality of life wouldnt be that great
574545 my mother for one is very comfortable in her own home
574546 shes already 92 and wants to stay in her home and we want her to do that as long as she can if the nurses didnt come in it would be a hardship
574547 you get a set amount based on your patients and the payers they have but the cost of doing business is going up and the insurers are not taking that into account its not like medicare would say gas is really high and im going to let you keep that 2 percent increase i was going to freeze
574548 i think they love what they do and see the positive impacts it has on patients in their homes
574549 but the people who might consider it an option and home care is a growing part of the health care field may choose not to go to into home health care because of it

574552 on august 8 the weather in new mexico was quite boring storm wise due to a very dry atmosphere at mid levels almost no cumulus succeeded in becoming a storm and those that did manage quickly dissipated this changed in the evening as the atmosphere destabilized due to radiative cooling at high altitude a few storms started to the w nw and nnw of langmuir laboratory i drove along the ridge of the magdalena mountains to south baldy a vantage point at 10 782 ft altitude and managed to photograph some splendid lightning in front of the twilight arch i photographed it with nikon fe 85mm lens at f 4 on fuji provia 100f unfortunately i missed two other bolts from the blue flashes in this storm because they appeared in different places and the frame size was limited i had forgotten to bring a more suitable lens

574579 problems are formulated by people who can envisage a solution
574580 you mean to say theyve taken what we thought we think and made us think we thought our thoughts weve been thinking our thoughts we think we thought you think

574586 its good for malaysia where track cycling is concerned my personal goal is for the team to finish in the top eight of the team sprint and hopefully we will clock a new personal best
574587 a top eight finish in the 200m sprint will be great for the keirin if we can get both riders in the final top six we have a good chance to get into the medal round
574588 but it depends on how everything is set up on the track the beijing track is suited to azizuls style when we first went there for the world cup last year it has tight corners and long straights good for a sprinter like him

574605 she accepts the fact that the testing was properly done and the results properly reported
574606 will seek to have her period of suspension reduced substantially
574607 jessica did not knowingly or intentionally take any banned substances
574608 jessica is heartbroken at this turn of events as making the u s olympic team was her cherished dream and proudest moment
574609 she intends to resume her swimming career as soon as possible and to again fulfill her olympic dream in 2012
574610 their faith in her was justified and she will soon give them more reason to be proud of her and her accomplishments
574611 i think that if you were to ask anyone at trials what should happen if the first place finisher were to test positive for a banned substance they would tell you that third place would move up
574612 it is clear that along this road from the timing of trials to the usada testing to who knew what on july 21st to this last decision errors were made and at this point no one in the leadership of our sport is acknowledging that or if any acknowledgment is made it is an ever circling blame game
574613 been told by people within the usoc and usa swimming that usa swimming knew about the positive drug test before the entry deadline
574614 excuse me young men theres going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later let me make my statement why dont yall sit down then you can ask a question thats why were having a town hall meeting sit down
574615 would have a chance to ask your question but you dont want to disrupt the whole meeting just be courteous thats all all you have to do is be courteous
574616 just be courteous and youll have a chance to make your statement just relax thats all
574617 that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community of this country
574618 well i ah the ah i guess hold on a second
574619 everybody i want everybody to be respectful thats why were having a town hall meeting this is democracy at work
574620 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us can come together black white hispanic asian native american young old disabled gay straight that i think should be our agenda all right
574621 of ignoring the plight of poor blacks targeted by predatory lenders police brutality and racist attacks
574622 all these attacks are clearly being made on the african community
574623 it shows that instead of drawing up clear guidelines and sticking to them the department has just confused its position in the intervening period
574624 where a school admits a person of a religious denomination but then seeks to impose a dress code requirement which runs contrary to that students religious beliefs it may constitute unlawful discrimination against that student
574625 it follows that this department would expect schools to allow students of that denomination to wear the hijab and indeed it is our understanding that this approach is being followed by schools
574626 the law has not changed so why has the department changed its position since 7 7 this has become more of a political issue my daughter wore the hijab all through her first year in school and it was not contentious then at the end of the year it suddenly became an issue
574627 not one single child in ireland wears a niqab or burqa
574628 the people who raise that issue want to provoke fear and suspicion
574629 this is not an immigrant issue its about freedom to practice religious beliefs people say we should assimilate but i was born in wexford i am irish and muslim
574630 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
574631 to now be able to prosecute him for the murders
574632 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
574633 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
574634 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and opening allowing the fbi to now be able to prosecute him for the murders and that it was all my fault and its going to be my fault that they can now get him
574635 high heel wearing fulfills the dictates of male dominant culture and gives satisfaction to men
574636 woman are immediately recognizable as they walk with difficulty on their toes in public places thus high heels enable women to complement the male sex role of masculinity in which men look sturdy and have both feet on the ground with clear evidence of female fragility
574637 eight out of 10 women who replied to a global shoe survey carried out by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons said their feet hurt mainly because of high heels
574638 found that over 80 per cent of women would not change the type of shoes they wore solely to alleviate a foot problem
574639 three out of four women may have a serious foot problem by the time they reach their 60s

574674 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
574675 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
574676 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
574677 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
574678 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
574679 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
574680 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
574681 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
574682 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
574683 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
574684 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
574685 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
574686 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
574687 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
574688 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
574689 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
574690 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
574691 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
574692 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
574693 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
574694 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
574695 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
574696 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
574697 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
574698 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
574699 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
574700 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
574701 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
574702 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
574703 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
574704 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
574705 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
574706 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
574707 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
574708 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
574709 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
574710 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
574711 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
574712 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
574713 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
574714 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
574715 im not really sure what happened but thats a done issue thats something that obviously people hear stuff im here practicing waiting and i obviously cant wait till the season starts
574716 im in a great frame of mind why wouldnt i be im with a new team a great bunch of guys im looking forward to getting this season on the road and actually looking forward to going into next week and try to put everything together as a team and as an offense
574717 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better

574736 i tried to get a championship shirt in black and gold but they dont make them in those colors
574737 my plan was to take a class this summer at ku figuring it would be nice to only have to drive like two miles to campus
574738 and it would probably still be cheaper to take it at ku than at johnson county community college
574739 because of rising gas prices i have started riding the jc bus to class every day
574740 as the summer has progressed ive noticed more people ditching their cars and riding the bus
574741 the companys offer was the best offer made to employees in more than 20 years
574742 the company addressed every major issue brought to the bargaining table by union leadership as the proposed package contains increased wages more choices in health care plans and improved medical dental vision and pension benefits

574794 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
574795 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the us
574796 the danger is not that modernization will be sacrificed to fund asymmetric capabilities but rather that in the future we will again neglect the latter
574797 retreat from openness and democracy could have significant security implications for the united states
574798 i dont see either nation as a threat to the united states at this point but they both are investing in modernization programs that are of concern
574799 this approach tailors investment of substantial but not infinite resources in ways that favor key enduring us strategic advantages
574800 at the same time we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to china if necessary
574801 to bully its neighbors all of which are cause for concern
574802 all of these actions suggest a russia exploring renewed influence and seeking a greater international role

574810 the fact that aloe vera actually has seeds is known to very few
574811 even though aloe vera farming is done in the north gujarat belt this discovery will make it more economical since the number of aloe vera seeds per kilogram is 2 67 500 the seeds could be collected upon maturity and used for germination
574812 the research paper claiming the discovery of aloe vera seed and its oil properties has already been published in the journal of indian patents around six months ago no one has challenged it till now

574816 that is the whole idea to create a sense of trust and then exploiting it
574817 i am proud of asu and of being a graduate but i dont feel like ive done enough to get into the hall of fame
574818 it makes me feel funny i dont know how to write that many zeroes
574819 i like traveling and exploring places and i wanted to have fun while i worked so it made sense
574820 to people who have been using our products and have better health as a result and people who sell our products can afford a better lifestyle and end up giving back to their own communities its nice to see people move beyond worrying over getting enough food to eat and putting a roof over their heads
574821 sticking a finger in honey you cant do it without getting a little honey on your finger and then everything you touch after that is a bit sticky
574822 robbing peter while thinking they can pay paul down the road
574823 eventually i had to tell him that i couldnt afford to have him around as i didnt have a big enough money tree to satisfy all of his problems
574824 nowadays i spend more time working on projects to help people who have less thats what is fun for me
574825 is still the same guy i was when working three jobs to get through college i do about the same thing today ive always done
574826 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
574827 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
574828 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
574829 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
574830 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
574831 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
574832 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
574833 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
574834 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
574835 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war
574836 i am extremely pleased with them and we have nothing but admiration for what they can do lake amistad resort amp marina operates a highly respected environmental management system in our community
574837 billionaire entrepreneur with operations in 125 countries a host of philanthropic projects worldwide and frequent flyer miles to match
574838 approximately 9 million distributors enjoy the support tools and guidance to live healthier and wealthier lives
574839 im a management systems auditor and work on things like this for other companies too
574840 when rex maughan made the decision we were going to get involved with environmental stewardship it was because hes always been involved with it but in 2002 he made the decision for us to implement these management systems to further our efforts and to create a structure to improve how we do things
574841 what ems is is nothing more than a set of tools to help conform to iso 14001 and it puts us in a position to manage all the activities and operations
574842 our emphasis is to take a look at every single aspect of your operation and identify everything you do for example in housekeeping interior and exterior fuel sales waste left behind by the visitor used oil from generators and items we put on the boats to save energy for example we use inverters that run the boat from solar panels for refrigeration instead of using fuel from the generators its good for the environment and good for the visitor because they can learn from and participate in what were trying to achieve
574843 and we always set the next years targets at least a little bit higher then too
574844 we use the ems to track our electricity usage fuels potable water items weve purchased and things that are recycled
574845 before any material comes on our property we convene a steering committee to review the msds sheets and discuss what they tell us to do if theres any kind of spill for example
574846 if something happens to disconnect or rupture that hose it will shut down fuel delivery from the tank and id bet you wouldnt find more than a teaspoon that escaped
574847 i have invited anyone who wants to come here to visit our facilities and try to find any pollution
574848 its microorganisms that eat only hydrocarbons its dormant but when you spray it on oil it wakes up eats it and goes dormant again and theres nothing left behind
574849 but they are brand new engines in top running condition
574850 is to keep batteries filled so for some uses the boats generators can be turned off for example you dont need the generator to keep the refrigerator cold the solar panels will do that
574851 even if one of them sprung a little leak the styrofoam would still be contained
574852 theyll coordinate all the local assets to correct the problem and will come on scene to take over if its necessary
574853 for example the gray water from all the houseboats could legally go into the lake but they have gone to great efforts to capture it from each boat and pump it into our park sewage treatment facilities they just installed a 10 000 system at diablo east to get this done
574854 recognizes and drives environmental excellence by encouraging facilities with strong environmental records to go above and beyond their legal requirements
574855 but you have to establish goals and targets and its a very good way to enhance and improve our performance lake amistad resort amp marina is a member of this too the reason we do it is that its simply the right thing to do we should all learn to be caretakers of our environment and the natural and cultural resources in which we operate we dont just do this because we operate in a lot of national parks and recreation areas we operate a lot of private facilities too
574856 i would like to develop docks for more small boats up at rough canyon
574857 id also like to see a few cabins in the diablo east area and wed really like to do some enhancement of basic public services at box canyon ramp and launch area on the north shore of the lake with small boat rentals a store and fuel sales
574858 many people told us that having some small cabins for rent at diablo east would be a great improvement and yes we endorse that as for box canyon its also in the gmp general management plan that there should be tour boat service from there to panther cave and parida cave famed rock art sites not accessible without a boat you just cant get there on a houseboat from de because of the distance 37 miles and prohibitive fuel costs
574859 its not just talk with them they walk the talk
574860 and we invited them to spend a week with us about a month ago to assist in setting up our own park environmental management system its a nationwide program and grant can monitor whether the park is working on it hell call and say hey guys you know this is important you have some targets to hit in short forever resorts goes through extreme expense and trouble to get things done for the environment the company even promotes and encourages green purchasing from a huge data base to find products that will do exactly what you want them to do without polluting in other words completely environmentally friendly products
574861 theyve never charged us rental for a houseboat for these trips
574862 and weve had about 135 trips out on the lake with these kids
574863 most of these kids have never been on the lake thats right at their back door and larry and susan have been just wonderful to work with theyve been with us from the very start
574864 not enough is done at the very top end of the tourist market
574865 everyone in bordeaux thinks people wait on bended knee for their wines but nowadays excellent wines are produced all over the world
574866 the oenotourism trend in bordeaux is more oriented towards volume agencies and hotels and restaurants catering to the very top end are harder to find
574867 in my view luxury tourism can only be tailor made for very small groups often of two people
574868 we have no limits really it is up to what people want
574869 americans are the avid wine lovers they are looking for discoveries to learn about different grapes and comparisons with californian wines they want to know the history
574870 the russians stay two or three days with a chauffeur and an interpreter and have very heavy tasting schedules
574871 there are more and more luxury clients but the competition is tough
574872 places like italy spain and portugal have made huge efforts we have lessons to learn
574873 gd welcome mike geary to 4evertoneds fitness journal for those who do not know you please tell us a few things about yourself
574874 i really do understand that the overwhelming majority of fans wanted so badly for me to succeed
574875 additionally i would like to sincerely apologize to those fans offended by my wrongful actions last saturday night it was an overreaction on my part to what i felt was a series of public inaccurate and unfair remarks about me
574876 if some things had gone different for us early it might have been a different game
574877 there was some deception you could see on his pitches low and away to right handed hitters
574878 but we didnt get the big hit if we scored some runs early everything might have changed
574879 you can only get away with that one so many times
574880 that early yeah wed like to keep the lineup in our favor most times its worked for us
574881 paul didnt get the pitch where he wanted and they got a hit out of it
574882 ive got lilly on deck i know it i didnt want to throw him a strike i didnt even want to get close and i threw it right down the middle that pretty much sums up how the location went for me all day
574883 when the ball was up they got hits when i made my pitches i got ground balls
574884 it was just me kind of out of sync and not making my pitch but it happens im still confident going into the next one
574885 what makes this flooding surprising is that it is in the context of the opw works the jury is still out on whether these works will prevent flooding i suppose we will have to wait and see the other important thing is that every time a flood takes place the ministers come down and talk about compensation but i know of one business that still has not received a cent since the flooding the last time around
574886 first of all i have great sympathy for the people because it is devastating and frightening for a flood of water to go through anyones home i am thankful that thanks to prompt action by certain people that nobody lost their life
574887 the only hope for an economic revival in the foreseeable future lies in foreign fields the economy will remain in the doldrums until export growth on a substantial scale recommences but an acceleration in the pace of export expansion must await the return of strong global growth
574888 ryanair has been attacking me and my business for the past two years their strategy is to close down regional airports and aer arann
574889 so i called a meeting with him some months back to ask him face to face about what he was doing
574890 his airline has about 55 million passengers but theyre focusing on a small little airline with one million passengers it doesnt seem to add up for me that he is putting so much time and energy in to that
574891 so i rang him up last year and i said can i meet you to see what the story is and to see what youre at here we met in his office in
574892 thats when he told me that hed give me a bit of advice and said why dont you fuck off back to connemara where you came from then he said in no uncertain terms that he was going to take my business out and either take over or do the same to aer lingus
574893 i took it to mean that this is the situation and that this is the aim in other words if you cant stand the heat then get out of the kitchen and i think that was just his way of putting it
574894 i wasnt surprised by his comments he has made ruder remarks in his time but i just think that if this is the image of the irish business person abroad because he is a world class airline manager then thats certainly not a good thing
574895 what really hurt me was the way he pretended to play the fiddle the connemara remark didnt damage or hurt me but the fiddle thing was crazy
574896 i was just asking him what his strategy was what was he was trying to do what was his beef with aer arann and he told me he doesnt have beef with aer arann
574897 i said michael youve 700 routes ive only 40 but youre focusing on my key 40 routes i said to him its about you competing with me rather than me competing with you and then thats when he started pretending to play the fiddle he did that on two or three occasions during the meeting i got very frustrated but i didnt say anything to him i realised it was probably a mistake for me to go and meet the guy there was no point on arguing with him
574898 i came up one stairs to meet with him and afterwards i was walking down the stairs and he said no ill walk you out
574899 i felt that was the reason because i had said to him ill go out this way ill go out this way the way i came in and he replied ah no no no well go out this other way and he walked me the long way around through the office
574900 he uses a lot of bullying tactics towards aer arann but im not worried about it worrying is not a productive pastime ive a tsunami hitting me and thats ryanair and i have to do what i have to do to protect my business and survive this tsunami
574901 but all thats not withstanding that we are in extremely difficult and challenging times we are changing our business model to look at doing more third party work for example in relation to
574902 its just very unfortunate that a fellow irishman is trying to close me down the future is looking tough and there are some very challenging times ahead a lot of things have gone against us fuel is the big thing and i dont know what will happen with the economy well have to just wait and see but i believe aer arann is reasonably solid in the current climate and we are looking forward to maintaining our position as one of the top european airlines
574903 i was taken aback but you have to have a tough skin in this business i want michael oleary to know that you can take the man out of connemara but you cant take the connemara out of the man and i aint giving up easily
574904 i dont want it to get personal between myself and him i dont want to throw stuff at him in the media im not interested in a media war with michael oleary
574905 i think its important to say that in relation to the success that michael oleary has achieved with ryanair its unparalleled
574906 i think he has created a huge success out of the airline and i very much admire that and i wish him and the team in ryanair well and even more continued success
574907 i have huge respect for what michael oleary has achieved but i think he needs to realise that ryanair could be a lot more successful if their style was more ethical and not simply a my way or the highway approach you dont make money by screwing everyone around you
574908 f k off back to connemara where you came from
574909 padraig o ceidighs claim that he called a meeting with michael oleary in recent months is entirely untrue
574910 michael oleary has had no request from padraig o ceidigh for a meeting in recent months and nor has any such meeting been called or taken place during the last seven months of 2008
574911 michael oleary is disappointed by these latest false claims by padraig o ceidigh which are sadly consistent with the false claims padraig o ceidigh recently made to irish entrepreneur magazine
574912 throw away the lights the definitions and say of what you see in the dark
574913 i dont care what you are or what you do you are so very important to me and i dont want to lose that
574914 a big chunk of ice fell down and took a lot of the fixed lines with it
574915 can not move any further they halted before the traverse or before the bottleneck
574916 gerard is one of the strongest climbers on earth the most dangerous part is getting back down and we wont take it that he is down until he is right back at base camp
574917 it didnt bother me at all if it would have hed probably be in a stretcher and id probably be out of the game
574918 ive been on a stretcher before and technically hes been out of the game for three years in my mind
574919 that just shows how mentally weak he is new york beat him down
574920 its done and over with i cant live in the past
574921 the balls in his hand if he feels the need to do something then thats the way its going to be but im going in thinking its just another game trying to win a lots happened since then its one of those things where is it in the back of my mind sure but you know what im going out there to help my team win
574922 there are definitely concerns about the state college team as no one wants to see a club play like they are right now
574923 but i think there are a number of factors in play here
574924 our starters are all younger pitchers who have struggled against more advanced college bats
574925 typically you win in the minors with a good bullpen and we have struggled in that area too
574926 whos afraid of the old fuse box the old fuse box the old fuse box
574927 its only after weve lost everything that were free to do anything
574928 it describes that no matter what no matter where you actually are you are never alone because even when not a single person is around you the dark half of your mind is still there he is still very much there he is with you and he can whisper the darkest things that you would never want to consider nor think
574929 whats good for you might not be good for others
574930 low vitamin b 12 levels dont just occur in older people say researchers at the usda jean mayer human nutrition research center on aging at tufts university in boston and contrary to current wisdom meat poultry and seafood may not be good sources of the vitamin
574931 katherine tucker and colleagues measured blood levels and food or supplement sources of vitamin b 12 in roughly 3 000 men and women aged 26 to 83 whose health has been tracked since 1971 as part of the framingham offspring study
574932 a surprising 39 percent of the participants had blood levels below 350 pg ml the level at which neurological signs of vitamin b 12 deficiency or high homocysteine levels sometimes occur

574935 t plus one minute 40 seconds vehicle is headed downrange with a velocity of 1 050 meters per second and an altitude of 35 kilometers
574936 we are hearing from the launch control center that there has been an anomaly on the vehicle
574937 we dont have any information about what that anomaly is at this time we will of course be doing an assessment of the situation and providing information as soon as it becomes available check back to the website www spacex com for the latest information
574938 i know how much you want this sesha and i want to be able to give this opportunity to you but your mother
574939 i promise papa ill never ask you for anything ever again
574940 why does that not surprise me you always did have your head up in the clouds
574941 one of the weyrs has contacted us seeking a healer for one of their dragons
574942 yes she hates them but even she must offer aid to those in need of our skills you know that she wont go herself though shes sending father
574943 i am sure father will think it would be great experience for me
574944 and its not just so you can see the dragons again
574945 i do not think i know how to get home from here
574946 dont worry about it you just tell me where you need to go and ill drive ya s better than trying to walk it this time of day anyway
574947 leonard but only my momma calls me that you just call me leo
574948 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics
574949 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
574950 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
574951 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games
574952 it is a new low for the international community to see all these state leaders going to beijing without saying anything about the repressive environment in which the games are being held
574953 thousands of people including petitioners who have gone to beijing seeking justice from the government have been swept up in efforts to clean up the city before the games
574954 they said they were hired by the hospital and surveillance will last for the next four months it is said the olympics are approaching so they worry about us petitioners
574955 the police come to my place waiting outside and i do not know what they want to do with me
574956 because of the olympics approaching people like me nothing more than a rights defenders wife are being specially protected by the government

574960 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
574961 but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote
574962 the president knows that the impact of any new drilling will be insignificant promising savings of only pennies per gallon many years down the road
574963 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
574964 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
574965 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
574966 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
574967 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
574968 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
574969 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
574970 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
574971 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
574972 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
574973 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
574974 in my humble opinion i am none of those things
574975 i am not trying to prevent him from publishing this stupid book but if they publish it there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
574976 the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
574977 unless you are prepared to take these steps i shall issue proceedings against you
574978 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
574979 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
574980 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
574981 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
574982 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
574983 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
574984 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
574985 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
574986 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
574987 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
574988 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
574989 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
574990 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
574991 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
574992 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
574993 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
574994 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
574995 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
574996 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
574997 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
574998 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
574999 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
575000 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
575001 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
575002 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
575003 its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
575004 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
575005 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
575006 why is it that you have not had the ability to speak to the interests or even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community the black community in this country
575007 i thought this movie was supposed to be about extraterrestrials i thought that was what i was supposed to believe in
575008 we were here a few weeks ago and there were a lot of jellyfish we didnt even go in the water it was horrible
575009 but now theyre were getting the frequency of them a lot more weve had some of them that were just so tremendous that we have to come and pick off the beach
575010 during the recent new york city triathlon thousands of competitors were stung by jellyfish in the hudson river
575011 i think the level of jellyfish that we are seeing and the fact that they outnumber the fish that we want to eat is unprecedented
575012 now when jesus was in bethany at the home of simon the leper a woman came to him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume and she poured it on his head as he reclined at the table
575013 why this waste for this perfume might have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor
575014 for to me to live is christ to die is gain
575015 what is life for what do we live for if our life on earth is only temporary
575016 ask urself if it is the hard earned money status prada handbag that u want to carry with u til the last days of ur life or if its knowing u have lived a life worthy of gods grace on us
575017 i can hardly stand it you dont understand sometimes why things like this happen to kids
575018 my prayers and thoughts go out to the family and what theyre going through its hard for us but so much harder for their family
575019 because it doesnt have a swimming pool or central air
575020 the ad is a bit ironic given that mccain has been the most pop culture savvy republican candidate in quite some time
575021 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
575022 its still on its side in the ditch it has to be 100 percent stable for movement its not a quick process we have to make sure everything is stable first

575025 the incident took place at 9 15 pm saturday when 50 labourers were returning home to mansi in khagaria district
575026 we have to do this together both pakistan and india
575027 kind of specificity and information we have about the kabul blasts
575028 the prime minister was relatively frank about expressing his concerns on recent events which have had an impact on our relationship and the process of dialogue
575029 how to deal with recent events and how we could move the relationship forward
575030 theyve controlled the problem and treated it and now they are making sure that everything is working appropriately
575031 its not a good thing for business but its good for us
575032 i think thats admirable immigrants are able to do all of this without any official support if it was in madeira they would be knocking at the governments door for a subsidy
575033 im confirming something that ive seen wherever there are immigrants from madeira around the world which is the ability to do things
575034 theyre perfectly integrated in the community at large im just confirming what i already knew theres a spiritual connection to the homeland people are happy and celebrating that connection
575035 from one of the poorest regions in portugal to one of the most advanced
575036 hes a cute little fella he doesnt throw very hard and he doesnt have very good stuff
575037 it was probably a good idea that they did throw him out hes good hittin
575038 i would say if i was there it would not have happened
575039 id have to think pretty hard about going to cooperstown next year
575040 but in this trade market we were unable to accomplish them
575041 we have the best run differential in the american league we think we have a chance to be the best club in the american league
575042 i think we have to go back to being a team and go out and perform up to our expectations
575043 i think weve been underperforming for a lot of different reasons but we have the talent here to go out and win a lot of games the rest of the way and get where we want to go
575044 if this was the general managers way of doing it our front office guys way of doing it making our ballclub better then so be it
575045 i think were starting to get to back to where our bullpen has kind of taken the initiative of what our role is and what our job is to go out there and preserve ballgames
575046 theres a way to go about winning and we talked about that today we understand our long term goals for the season and i think we understand how we need to try and obtain those goals
575047 the biggest part is staying in the present and concern yourself with what you can control when you do that and weve done that better here than any place ive ever seen we just needed a little reminder
575048 what i think really brought us together was our common passion for dance
575049 the goal was to try and bring talented people to the area to share their experiences
575050 so far ive gotten great feedback everyone had a lot of fun learning new styles
575051 ooma anticipates that many users will choose to keep one regular land line hooked up and oomas scheme takes full advantage of that fact
575052 some of the bridges that will be targeted for improvements
575053 masshighway has advertised over 86 million in bridge projects in the srpedd region the past two years and our region has done well in comparison to other parts of the state in spite of the shortage of funds
575054 we have a strong group of 18 teams of inspectors supplemented with six different consultant contractors as needed
575055 bridge inspection teams examine and analyze every element of a bridge specifically the deck superstructure and substructure assigning each a condition rating on a scale of zero to 9
575056 its not about all the numbers its about making sure people are safe
575057 if there are any issues were concerned about we will work on it or well close the bridge
575058 under the footprint program weve had since 92 weve been able to replace a lot of structures that have become structurally deficient
575059 in that footprint program we put back something that the functional equivalent of what was there
575060 facing funding challenges we spent our limited funds to repair the parts of those bridges in most critical need of repair at that time we will continue to maintain and inspect those bridges to ensure their safety
575061 the accelerated bridge repair program is about reducing the number of structurally deficient bridges at an accelerated pace getting bridges off the list faster than theyre being added
575062 the emphasis here is preventing a bridge from becoming structurally deficient and fixing the ones that are structurally deficient with the accelerated bridge repair program we want to do that on a faster timeline
575063 were ready to hit the ground running to get a priority list worked up and get started on repairs and replacements
575064 it does not raise additional resources to address the extraordinary backlog of projects that we have neglected for decades
575065 the srpedd commission is not in favor of funding the entire 3 billion bond issue with gans and existing gas tax revenue
575066 from 2014 to 2030 the payments on the 3 billion bond bill will strip the commonwealth of construction funding needed to continue the effort with increased revenue we can catch up with our bridge maintenance responsibilities with a consistent and steady long term effort rather than a single burst of spending that lasts only eight years
575067 if they bond all the money they propose to be bonding the long term solution of the governor wont pan out because theyre not raising additional revenue
575068 with no extra revenue theyre just putting us in more debt as difficult as its going to be the state and federal governments need to provide new transportation resources
575069 srpedd feels that it is important that the commonwealths metropolitan planning organizations and regional planning agencies with their detailed knowledge of of their respetive regions are able to provide input and be involved in the process of selecting the bridges to be repaired under the program
575070 masshighway has been reviewing bridge lists with the regional planning agencies regularly since last summer
575071 we get a lot of impact from the community we frequently have two candidate bridges in the same area and we want to know from the people who live there which one should be done first
575072 we dont have an advisory role on what bridges are going to get done every year
575073 they masshighway just tell us which ones to put in our yearly program
575074 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
575075 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
575076 i love making buttons and shirts and playing drums i mean i learned how to play drums completely
575077 aku tak mengatakan maaf aku juga mengiriminya beberapa informasi aku mengiriminya sebuah surat dari peta yang isinya bagaimana buruknya pengaruh industri daging pada lingkungan

575079 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
575080 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections
575081 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
575082 difficult to negotiate an accord when unemployment is on the rise and the economy is weakening
575083 a 40 percent decline in price would have put most developing countries into bankruptcy the issue was one of very survival
575084 i hope that if obama gets elected there will be a new commitment to multilateralism
575085 i hope that obama will realise how important multilateralism is and will resume the talks on a more reasonable basis
575086 by having a lot of issues raised in the same forum it is easier to find a compromise
575087 the agreements already in place protect against the most serious problems
575088 just remember you dont need a license to hunt to shot gun your hunting partner
575089 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
575090 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
575091 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
575092 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
575093 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
575094 today we have absolutely no concerns about the organisation no regrets come the 9th of august the opening day of competition the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
575095 im not going to make an apology for something which the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china its the chinese authorities that are running the internet let me be very clear the ioc is in favour of the broadest availability of internet for you the media people that is the bottom line
575096 secondly there has been no deal whatsoever at any time between the ioc leadership at different levels and the organisers to say we agree with your procedure and we agree with your pattern
575097 if we allow political propaganda its the end of the harmony of the olympic village and the end of the harmony of the games
575098 the bus i took was very crowded many people come here to watch the fireworks we are so excited i came a long way here and maybe i can only watch the fireworks for just a couple of minutes but i still feel it worthwhile and i am very happy
575099 the governor is at this point racking up some accomplishments some legislation hes been pushing for its a nice pay off for him
575100 i want to express appreciation to cecil b demille for organizing this
575101 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
575102 we have to stop rallies and marches or anything that leads to mass gatherings
575103 what they say hamas is doing in gaza they are doing here
575104 at some point relying on miracles is not going to be the best way to manage our system
575105 i would pray we dont have to have another disaster to bring about the right attention to this i see very little political will there
575106 the minneapolis incident obviously caused people to stand up and take notice but i think it got dwarfed by the bad economic news
575107 whos to blame congress the american people for putting up with it
575108 structural deficiency ultimately determines whether a bridge will stand or fall
575109 if you look at the full picture of bridges and the task that transportation professionals have
575110 we need to take them down not leave it to mother nature
575111 the federal government has basically ignored infrastructure at every level
575112 it is not acceptable for us to have concrete falling off a bridge
575113 im confident that by showing respect to the people to the olympics it will put me in a position to continue to have frank and candid discussions
575114 this is an enormous show of face gesture of face from the president to actually go to the olympics
575115 this is chinas international coming out party in many respects the olympics so its an enormous thing
575116 if this man is going as the leader of the free world to one of the most notorious rights abusing regimes in the world and he spends the whole afternoon watching water polo what does that say about where the united states priorities lie

575121 it appeared the lady was coming out of the parking lot and she was hit broadside by a pickup truck
575122 julians interpretation of her revelations has drawn intense modern interest for she presents a view of go d this is personal and unique brimming with optimism and couched in simple and direct language
575123 before she began to compose the shorter text julian already knew all of the vulgate especially she can be seen to be deeply familiar with all four gospels the pauline and johannine epistles and hebrews the psalms the sapiential books and deutero isaias we can
575124 nonetheless it is obvious that she never doubted the truth of her revelations and she was confident that somehow the infinite love and power of god would be able to make all things well
575125 rejoicing in what i saw and wishing as much as i dared to see more it that were gods will or to see for a longer time what i had already seen
575126 god the blessed trinity who is everlasting being just as he is eternal from without beginning just so was it his eternal purpose to create human nature
575127 i saw and understood these three properties the property of fatherhood and the property of motherhood and the property o f the lordship in one god
575128 and our substance is in our father god almighty and our substance is in our mother god of all wisdom and our substance is in our lord god the holy spirit all goodness for our substance is whole in each person of the trinity who is one god
575129 our father wills our mother works and our good lord the holy spirit confirms
575130 she comes across these centuries as a great christian woman who has much to teach us and whose message reminds us of the beauty and joy that are inseparable from the christian faith
575131 is the glass half empty half full or twice the size it needs to be
575132 to be very clear on this matter in the beginning i was not told what it was
575133 imagine a mexican family bringing money that is damaged and the government calling it a drug deal
575134 that is one of the things we are extra concerned about this process being used to launder money from illegal activities
575135 thats one of our factors that we use to make a case suspicious
575136 i told them i suspect this is where its from but i didnt know
575137 they take you to your word like youre supposed to remember every single thing every single time
575138 given that the money is coming north from mexico that both conflicting and cockamamie stories have been told about its origins and that all the stories of how it got to be found are fantastical i strongly suspect that the felhaber currency is the proceeds of illegal bulk narcotics sales
575139 and you dont fu in live here and this is a non smoking house now get the fu out of here
575140 well grandma i know you dont agree with gay marriage and i respect that but did you know that over the last eight years weve actually created policies that hurt the elderly and working people you may agree with your friends at church but i know a lot of people hurting and we need a change
575141 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
575142 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
575143 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
575144 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
575145 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
575146 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
575147 i was excited to have avocet travel and clarence o smith associated with bella italia a travel club that is a celebration of black women and sisterhood
575148 to have a man that was once connected to a wonderful magazine like essence to administer our tour seemed like a perfect union
575149 i was also excited that we were supporting an african american business i never dreamt that today myself and 59 other black women who have worked so hard to scrape up money to pay for this tour would have all our hopes and dreams for the vacation of a lifetime threatened because avocet spent the money that was not theirs to spend not only was our money spent but also the monies earmarked for a fund to help send foster children and their mentors on international tours through the icare foundation
575150 my first job was for a tool company but i got fired when they found out i was under age i next became a truck driver but i didnt really drive anyone anyplace until i got famous and drove the girls crazy who am i

575153 his dream became a reality and it has truly flourished today because of steves unending drive and determination this basketball complex stands as a safe haven for area youth it is a privilege to recognize steve as our hometown hero
575154 people eat with their eyes they go through the line and they just load up and then sit down
575155 we thought it would increase the mess and the amount of cleanup to be done by dining hall staff
575156 if the kids have to very carefully portion out what they are going to eat they wont overload their trays and waste so much food
575157 i was looking for a career where i could help people and also work with animals
575158 this is absolutely perfect i feel like im making a difference
575159 i like animals especially dogs i look forward to seeing chaloop because he is a beautiful dog
575160 i love dogs and i thoroughly enjoy the pet therapy program at autumn glen
575161 christy and her dog have successfully completed the pet therapy certificate program and now their mission is to visit the elderly to help bring comfort and joy into their lives
575162 our residents respond so favorably to these sessions as do the animals it truly is therapy for the soul
575163 she was always so sweet and so supportive she was so encouraging to kids using the library
575164 im doing a research project now on african american history in guilford and guess whos helping me research it shes over at the temporary library and shes digging out all kinds of books for me to get information and everything
575165 many contributions she has made to our quality of life in guilford
575166 next year well have her 101st in the renovated library at 67 park st
575167 shes a lovely person and shes a very dedicated and professional librarian
575168 she will research something until she gets the answer she probably helped five generations of guilford citizens as they used the library from 1933 til now
575169 our church goes back to 1639 so you know she has found this stuff shes saved the stuff shes preserved the stuff shes catalogued the stuff and shes indexed it three different ways shes usually still in once a week to do work on all our historical things
575170 the bottom line is shes great and everyone loves her
575171 she does have a twinkle in her eye and shes a very special lady
575172 you get up and wake up in the morning its just like any other day
575173 sometimes its a rock but you really do get to know the feeling
575174 weve been pretty forgiving were giving people the benefit of the doubt they dont know we have a new program and they need a permit
575175 you go out there on any given day youve got all sorts of people from westport bridgeport stamford thomaston enfield people from the valley shelton they come from all over to come down here to go clamming
575176 if you like it you could be very wealthy or impoverished and do it
575177 they may not even be aware they have to go through a permitting process thats more a likelihood
575178 you talk to some other guys they dont want to spend a dime
575179 in the 30 years ive been doing this i never had one time ever where there was a shortage
575180 thats why i choose to sing the blues mama said son you better sing the blues
575181 i love onset i love the day i love the blues
575182 i get to hang out with all my friends all my blues buddies
575183 i more or less stayed in the house and played my heart out
575184 her voice is incredible roomful of blues i got a couple of their cds
575185 theyll miss out if they dont come early and stay for the whole thing
575186 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
575187 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
575188 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
575189 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
575190 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
575191 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
575192 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
575193 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
575194 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
575195 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
575196 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
575197 we face serious issues in this election and have real differences
575198 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars i will however compare our two visions for our economic future
575199 this is someone who has been in washington nearly 30 years has a pretty slim record on education and when he has taken a stand its been the wrong one
575200 ever since last winter the public have had to endure an ongoing string of increases in energy prices
575201 but the announcement from british gas has sent a lot of people quite literally over the precipice into fuel poverty people will be too afraid to switch on their heating this winter because they will be scared of the bill
575202 our onebill team has been keeping a close eye on energy prices for months it is their job to work on behalf of our customers to bring their monthly household bills down and they are poised to act
575203 we want people to stop shrugging off the news and struggling on with their existing provider and to come to us and let us help
575204 on average we save customers up to 500 a year which is a massive consideration in the current climate who can afford to pay 500 year more than necessary
575205 moneyway has had a huge increase in people coming to us in recent months with concerns over their finances both wanting advice on getting out of debt and avoiding getting into it by being more savvy with their cash
575206 our teams will be taking to the streets to talk to people about their bills to explain how they could save them money and encourage them to take the plunge and take a stand against the energy providers who seem to be increasing their prices
575207 its just a hand full of the toy manufacturers so i want to think it will get under control but we cant predict the future
575208 as a locally owned and operated business we have always tried to stock alternatives to what you will find next door at fred meyer
575209 spanking and the corporal punishment of children the sexual story
575210 i never was anti spanking or anything i guess it didnt occur to me until i was trying to teach my daughter that its not okay to hit or bite or pinch
575211 it just didnt make sense to me that i could be always telling her its not okay to hit and then go and smack her
575212 but life is so much more fulfilling and meaningful with kids
575213 if i had acted like that id have been spanked
575214 o canal do flamengo no youtube um marco hist rico para o google pois o primeiro a permitir uma intera o com torcedores do esporte favorito dos brasileiros
575215 a partir de hoje teremos a maior torcida do futebol nacional participando do maior site de v deos do mundo
575216 it is not a matter of embracing islam the parents have a right to their children under the law
575217 muslim clerics have threatened the judge that if he allows the girls to go with the christians they will kill him
575218 even when the court allowed the girls to approach their parents amjad alis relatives were standing around them
575219 i do not want to talk with you i dont want to go with you i dont recognize you
575220 please pray that the lord protects their minds and brings them back to us
575221 this year alone since january we have recorded 35 major incidents of atrocities against the christian community
575222 when we talk of major incidents we do not count minor incidents like cases of harassment beatings attacks on church halls and filing false cases against christian workers
575223 the bjp which is used to segregating masses on religious lines and attacking minorities even physically will do so even more and would like to show hindus that they are the only saviors of hinduism and that if they do not protect the hindus they will all become christians or muslims
575224 are a technique to polarize the votes they bjp and affiliates want to threaten the hindu community that christians are going ahead of them
575225 the bjp thinks that by doing this they can consolidate the hindu votes which is not true
575226 the life of christians has become miserable at the hands of miscreants in connivance with the police
575227 there are allegations that when atrocities were committed on christians the police remained mere spectators and in certain cases they did not even register their complaints
575228 getting into bed with strategic media the incorrigible bottom dwellers of torontos outdoor advertising industry
575229 you love sin and live in it and you are going on from bad to worse but all the same i forgive you
575230 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death who shall enable me to live above temptation and to become holy even as god is holy
575231 the clinton supporters told me theyre going to vote for obama but theyre not going to work for him
575232 theyd say ok ok i know hes the nominee just dont expect me to have a house party for him
575233 the women in rural areas the farm wives are not necessarily going to be that accepting of a candidate like sen obama its not so much about his color or at least thats not what theyre saying they just dont feel they know him he does have some more work to do to win them over
575234 this was the longest primary campaign in the history of the democratic party
575235 given the closeness of the outcome the length of the race and the loyalty supporters felt to their candidates when you have that level of investment yes youre going to have disappointment when youre on the losing side
575236 women as a voting bloc hold this election in their hands we know that a healthy gender gap produces a democratic president
575237 she has suspended her campaign and that is a distinction with a difference
575238 is not over she didnt end it i have not heard from her or the campaign that it is over and you could interpret that in a lot of different ways you never know
575239 ive been in politics a long time and its a good old boys club no doubt about that but she was an inspiration ms
575240 this has been the most personal of any of the campaigns ive ever been in and it was a big disappointment when she lost
575241 i saw the handwriting on the wall as soon as the media started to beat the hell out of her
575242 but for a lot of people im talking to its up in the air
575243 when the talk drifted to the campaign and the women i sat with professional college educated women were saying the one chance in their lifetime to see a woman president had passed
575244 our internal polls show he has the most difficulty with women over 65 and white men
575245 and frankly it confuses me that some people are still debating whether a woman should be the nominee its over i say and obama is their best choice
575246 my hunch is that in the fall it wont be women per se but blue collar workers who will be more of a problem for obama for a variety of reasons
575247 its her time a womans time than it was about some of the themes raised by clinton during the primary
575248 for the voters who fell into the category of the bitter gate comment overall thats a bigger problem than winning back college educated women
575249 i usually say something pretty trite like oh disagreement is the democratic way but you cant cut through that kind of anger very easily and have a rational conversation with someone in that mode so i just say call us down at obama headquarters if you have any questions
575250 but seriously are these people going to really jump ship and vote for john mccain i really doubt it
575251 he told the us we had 10 days to get over it well women arent over it
575252 i will tell you that women are far angrier than i expected it actually surprises me that women have resisted moving on for as long as they have but i think they just feel that in their lifetime they will never see this kind of momentum for this kind of candidate again
575253 das liegt an den winzern jeder von ihnen ist ein individualist sie sorgen mit ihrer kreativit t f r vielf ltigkeit
575254 dieses jahr werden 1 2 millionen flaschen junker abgef llt

575261 mientras tanto los 11 jueces comenzaron ayer las deliberaciones para dictar sentencia en el caso m s importante de los ltimos a os en la vida pol tica de este pa s los peri dicos se hac an eco ayer de declaraciones de erdogan este fin de semana en las que reconoc a haber cometido algunos errores que tienen que ver con el proceso de ilegalizaci n oktay uygun catedr tico de derecho p blico en la universidad de estambul recordaba ayer que el partido de la virtud ya fue ilegalizado por el constitucional s lo por haber anunciado que pensaba levantar la prohibici n de usar el velo en los edificios p blicos mientras que el de erdogan ha llegado a aprobarlo en el parlamento yusuf kanli uno de los columnistas mas le dos tiene pocas dudas sobre la decisi n de los jueces aunque yo estoy en contra de la prohibici n de partidos que no se hayan mezclado con la violencia
575262 turqu a ha entrado en una semana crucial para su futuro con el eco del terrible atentado del domingo por la noche en estambul que caus casi veinte muertos y m s de un centenar de heridos muchos de ellos muy graves es dif cil saber si algo as puede intervenir decisivamente en la situaci n pol tica marcada por la inminente sentencia del tribunal constitucional contra el partido del primer ministro tayip sic erdogan pero lo que est cada vez m s claro es que si los jueces decidieran ilegalizar al akp partido de la justicia y el desarrollo no es previsible que eso sorprenda a nadie ni que provoque grandes reacciones de apoyo al l der islamista subrayado y negrita del autor del post la econom a no va tan bien como en los ltimos a os y se considera que en caso de grandes tribulaciones como frente a estos atentados terroristas los turcos suelen volver su mirada hacia las omnipresentes fuerzas armadas ayer en las mezquitas de estambul donde se celebraron los funerales hab a francotiradores en lo alto de los minaretes en vez de muecines llamando a la oraci n
575263 no hace falta ning n tipo de ingrediente para aumentar el catastrofismo entre los turcos la econom a vuelve a ir medianamente sic mal sobre todo porque es un pa s sensible a las bruscas subidas de los alimentos b sicos y el petr leo con las consecuencias correspondientes en la vida cotidiana cuando se anuncie la decisi n de los jueces no parece que vaya a haber grandes manifestaciones de apoyo a erdogan subrayado y negrita del autor del post a pesar de que hace ahora un a o obtuvo un resultado r cord en las elecciones con un 47 por ciento de los votos y eso es lo que se cree que va a pasar en todo caso elecciones anticipadas la prueba es que los diputados empezando por los del akp preparan una ley que garantiza sus pensiones con menos de un a o de mandato
575264 they said it was safe and we didnt think twice about it
575265 it was loud but it was the prettiest show you ever saw
575266 its hard to believe it happened in a place like that but it was just beautiful absolutely beautiful then after a while it ended and we all went to sleep
575267 i didnt feel like i was any better than anybody else
575268 if other people were going i figured i needed to go too
575269 we dated a while and decided we needed to get married
575270 it was hard going in the service with a new wife
575271 but lots of other men were doing it and i didnt want people to wonder about me
575272 that ship was so big that when we stood next to it on the dock you couldnt see both ends of it at the same time
575273 but i picked it up pretty quick and its a good thing because you didnt want that kitchen to shut down
575274 the australians called it mutton but it was basically goat
575275 it wasnt that bad but it wasnt what we were used to
575276 he told them he was just trying to get that horse meat to sit still long enough to cut it
575277 those other guys turned green and ran out of there so quick you cant believe it we got a kick out of that
575278 but some still wanted to fight and we took care of them
575279 i know they buried lots of enemy soldiers hiding in those caves but the rest kept coming
575280 we jumped up and hollered a little then somebody said start the movie and that was it
575281 some of us werent so sure we were going to make it
575282 these closures are a necessary part of the ongoing project to relieve congestion along the interstate in coweta county
575283 treat them the same as any other enforcement when their lights are on
575284 slow down pay attention and do not follow too closely
575285 only get out of your vehicle and get quickly over that concrete barrier wall if you are absolutely 100 percent sure you are safe to get out of your vehicle
575286 we may not get to you in the normal way but well get to you
575287 think about my wife and kids i want to go home to them
575288 it kept shaking just a little too long and it just took a couple of seconds to realize what was going on
575289 we experienced one in florida a couple of years ago and so we knew the situation
575290 people didnt realize what was going on because most were tourists
575291 our children are aware that they live on a fault that is constantly going and nobodys really concerned
575292 you see the projected path and you have time to buy food and batteries and board up the house but with a quake it just happens
575293 with an earthquake theres nothing you can do about it
575294 and if you run outside youre going to get injured by falling debris
575295 but the government in california is prepared for it i think
575296 we want you to join us to get on the streets of edinburgh to text us or call us
575297 well i could say i did it i mean i was halfway across town when they happened and people saw me running around saving hostages when those people were dying but we can make it work ill valiantly sacrifice myself for this city
575298 creo que la federaci n tiene que observar un poquito que a estas alturas arrancar un campeonato es una locura el calor es impresionante el desgaste de los jugadores es muy f cil para los de pantalones largos que est n en su casa con aire acondicionado y los jugadores mat ndose con m s de 40 grados de calor
575299 no se puede jugar bien al futbol porque es algo f sico no solamente t cnico no se puede jugar a estas temperaturas
575300 los horarios hay que preverlos o alargar un poquito m s el campeonato tranquilamente el campeonato puede empezar un poquito m s tarde o disponer horarios de noche no se le puede exigir al jugador m s de lo que hace porque al jugador no s lo lo afecta en lo f sico sino en lo mental sales fastidioso cansado mont n de cosas
575301 calores como ste en septiembre octubre no creo al momento va a estar dif cil pero voy a insistir
575302 el desgaste en el primer tiempo se sinti en algunos jugadores el caso de ochoa de arellano los jugadores entre comillas m s t cticos que tenemos est bamos en el minuto veinte veinticinco fundidos
575303 hay que dosificar m s hay que ganar pero en noventa minutos quisieron ganar en el primer tiempo aniquilarlos y en el segundo tiempo ya est bamos fundidos
575304 uno sale a atacar y atacar ochoa tiene que correr 60 metros ah viene el desgaste de arellano de ochoa
575305 obvio que a nadie le gusta empezar perdiendo el partido de local nos doli bastante y ahora igual salimos dolidos porque no era un partido para perder pero as se dan las cosas y no hay que desesperarse hay que tener paciencia y buscar el triunfo
575306 yo creo que no fue superior monterrey en ning n momento pero el marcador fue as y eso es lo que indica entonces que te puedo decir
575307 nos ha faltado el gol y el punch arriba para poder cambiar los partidos en el primero nos llegaron una vez y perdimos uno a cero ahora una llegada en el primer tiempo y otra en el segundo un autogol entonces no es lo que normalmente pasa en los partidos
575308 pero a veces no te alcanza el merecer creo que hay que hacerlo en la cancha y de pronto no hemos corrido con fortuna y con la contundencia necesaria para poder manejar los partidos siempre hemos ido en contra y eso te saca de planes
575309 falta mover algunas cositas y en cualquier momento puede cambiar la suerte porque el equipo no juega mal el equipo trabaja y no es que le est n pasando por encima o que el equipo no est caminando no es as y vamos a esperar
575310 muy contento apenas vamos iniciando y faltan muchas cosas por delante por hacer
575311 siento que el equipo va bien va tomando su nivel se jug muy bien hoy a pesar de que hubo mucho calor y muy contento por la victoria
575312 es muy complicado y muy cansado y mucho desgaste pero as es el futbol mexicano
575313 el partido pasado los goles que recibimos fueron por descuidos propios hoy el equipo estuvo muy bien parado atr s estuvimos s lidos y eso es lo que tenemos que darle al equipo seguridad que adelante los goles llegan solos
575314 contento por eso desde el torneo planeamos hacer eso colgar ceros hoy se nos dio y contentos m s por el triunfo por los tres puntos y nos vamos muy contentos del estadio
575315 era importante ganar de local hoy gracias a dios pudimos hacerlo y esperemos que podamos seguir as
575316 no fue tan f cil un equipo que se ech atr s esperando un error de nosotros gracias a dios no lo cometimos y las oportunidades que tuvimos las supimos aprovechar
575317 sinceramente el calor estaba bastante fuerte creo que se debe pensar un poquito en el cambio del horario de juego porque es un problema no s lo para los jugadores que vienen del otro equipo sino para nosotros tambi n
575318 como l jonathan orozco todos ser n observados no especialmente vine a ver a jonathan en general a los dos equipos pero mientras est n participando y est n jugando ser n observados por el cuerpo t cnico del se or eriksson
575319 siempre ver un partido de futbol es interesante siempre se saca algo rescatable
575320 desde que l eriksson asumi el cargo estamos en esa cuesti n de tener la mejor y la mayor informaci n tanto a nivel nacional y ver a los equipos con los que toca eliminarnos en este caso primeramente con honduras y posteriormente con jamaica que ya tuve oportunidad de estar en dallas viendo el salvador jamaica
575321 pr ximamente habr un partido entre honduras y bolivia y tambi n se checar todo y por el momento se lleva buena informaci n de lo que es honduras para poder enfrentarlo de la mejor manera y poder sacar el mejor resultado que es ganar
575322 no hay rival peque o es el grupo m s parejo de los tres yo apelo a la capacidad y a la calidad de los jugadores que est n jugando fuera del pa s y los que est n en m xico sin subestimar al rival partiendo de ese punto habr m s posibilidades de obtener el triunfo
575323 esta es la tercera eliminatoria que me toca participar la primera fue con el se or aguirre la segunda con el se or lavolpe que fue entrenador m o jug el puesto m xico siempre ha sido cuna de buenos porteros y en este caso no es la excepci n
575324 just wanted to let you know that kathi russ and i loved the wizards they worked out perfectly im sure well be using you again
575325 i am only three times my sons age my father is 40 years more than twice my age together the three of us are a mere 1240 years old
575326 there were no student demonstrations over the previous increases of 300 last year and 200 the year before
575327 the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great
575328 that is why i have banned the import of these cats immediately
575329 india is one of the biggest aid donors to afghanistan
575330 from a geopolitical and aid stand the issue for india will be about how to improve security as ties grow closer
575331 i am not expecting any dramatic shift in relations relations are as close as they can be
575332 unless i get that invite ill be watching on tv
575333 i dont think its going to happen itd be nice if it did it would seem like the right thing to do
575334 but i think that passing the baton would have been a phenomenal idea
575335 after every games i have said i am going to retire
575336 but the way i am feeling right now i reckon i can do another one
575337 the team in general is very strong and there is no reason why they wont get the results they are looking for
575338 six or seven years ago there were very few chinese boats in finals
575339 now they are competing physically they are a very big team and a very fast team
575340 i took pictures of something they didnt like and they removed me deciding what i can and cannot document i dont see a clearer definition of censorship
575341 specifically mr miller provided our enemy with an after action report on the effectiveness of their attack and on the response procedures of u s and iraqi forces
575342 i dont think the uniformed military has really bought into the whole embed program
575343 during the invasion it got a lot of whoopee were kicking their butts type of tv coverage
575344 in disembedding mr miller the marines are using a catch all phrase which could be applied to just about anything a journalist does
575345 he said it was unsafe i know its unsafe theres a war going on it was unsafe when i got to iraq in 2003 but the military did not stop us from working now they are stopping us from working
575346 we were within hours of basra when they told me i had to go back i was told that general kelly did not want any western eyes down there
575347 there is leeway for commanders to make judgment calls which is part of what commanders do
575348 mr millers complete lack of respect to these marines their friends and families is shameful
575349 how do we explain to their children or families these disturbing pictures just days after it happened
575350 the fact that the images i took of the suicide bombing which are just photographs of something that happens every day all across the country the fact that these photos have been so incredibly shocking to people says that whatever they are doing to limit this type of photo getting out it is working
575351 i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
575352 not a week in we can do a lot better getting the ball down field
575353 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
575354 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical
575355 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
575356 for someone whos been in washington nearly 30 years hes got a pretty slim record on education and when he has taken a stand its been the wrong one
575357 im happy to put my record and ideas up against his any day
575358 i dont come out of central casting he said listing his youth name birth in hawaii and childhood in indonesia as things voters might not be used to
575359 what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from what my values are
575360 so what i think has been an approach of the mccain campaign is to say hes risky
575361 they are very good at negative campaigns they are not so good at governing
575362 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama who has opposed every element of john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling affordable nuclear energy and gas tax relief for hardworking families
575363 there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bipartisan group i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions
575364 but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect
575365 youre the foreigner there look at the slitty eyes black hair
575366 if any human being is put under siege like that they may well react in a way they wouldnt do
575367 could you imagine yourself being subjected to the abuse and the pushing that he was subjected to and be confident that you yourself would not react
575368 remember not everyone relies on racism to vent their rage
575369 i dont know how i would have responded should such a thing have happened to me

575375 nobody in the history of the world has ever even conceived of making this much less actually made it
575376 there are but 155 years left at which time the world will come to an end
575377 the sign which convinces me that our lord is hastening the end of the world is the preaching of the gospel recently in so many lands
575378 i spent seven years in your royal court arguing the case with so many persons of such authority and learned in all the arts and in the end they concluded that all was idle nonsense yet the outcome will be the fulfillment of what our redeemer jesus christ said that all that was written by him and by the prophets to be fulfilled
575379 the holy scriptures testify that this world will come to an end st augustine says that the end of this world will occur in the seventh millennium following the creation
575380 i have already said that for the execution of the enterprise of the indies neither reason nor mathematics nor world maps were profitable to me rather the prophecy of isaiah was fulfilled

575416 the people here like what the schools provide and we cant endanger that
575417 if this is the land of opportunity then we as a state and as a society have an obligation to create those opportunities for everyone as best we can

575447 i think this position is bunk the fact that the dod is asking certain questions in a certain way and will be interested in the findings does not mean the dod controls the research or that the science is compromised it doesnt mean that social scientists will be militarized or are unable to be critical of policies based on certain empirical fallacies it does mean that those who want the money will have to demonstrate the relevance of their research designs to the kinds of questions the dod wants answered but thats no different from any other nsf rfp what it also means significantly is that the dod at least wants to send the signal that it is actually prepared to consider the results in light of recent history i think this is a great leap forward

575470 maybe you think that pondering the imponderables will help you out of the mess
575471 our actions that we take and even the ones we dont take describe us and how we ve been formed from all of our experiences in the end they do help tell a story of who we are we use them as a guide on how we should live our life and it differs from person to person
575472 maybe you think that pondering the imponderables will help you out of the mess i disagree respectfully i think rumination will lead to depression and ennui

575536 so were telling one big story in season 3 and putting the torchwood crew under a huge amount of pressure and just seeing how they cope with their numbers depleted
575537 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
575538 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
575539 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
575540 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
575541 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead

575552 why 60s ideology failed in its ultimate motive and why we have a better shot at it now
575553 to suppose universal laws of nature capable of being apprehended by the mind and yet having no reason for their special forms but standing inexplicable and irrational is hardly a justifiable position
575554 wave particle duality is perhaps the most notable concept of the quantum world and by extension the philosophical basis of modern thought it is the defining characteristic of elementary physical entities such as electrons protons neutrons atoms and molecules which exist on the one hand in states which evolve like waves when they are not observed and evolve like particles when observed the key is the observation in its wave like state the physical entity is typically extended in space but then contracts abruptly to localized events or point like particles when an observation is made the emphasis on the abruptly is to emphasize that there is no evolvement from one state to another but an instantaneous manifestation of a wave that also has particle properties
575555 philosophically socrates has said that the unexamined life is not worth living this makes more than perfect sense in that when electrons are unexamined unobserved that is they not quite real not part of reality aristotle believed that matter without form was not quite real form brings matter into reality this idea explains why in many ancient practices e g wikka fundamental part of the ritual is to draw or layout a geometry as a means of creating reality in a manner particularly desired
575556 on the other hand when an observation is made the wave like state changes abruptly discontinuously and unpredictably in a quantum jump at the macro level the process is seemingly ruled by chance alone and thus there is the potential for a true choice being made furthermore no predictions are possible as to how the electron will actually transform from the possible to the actual for example in radioactive decay of nuclei all samples will decay deterministically with a half life the time for half the sample to have decayed from one isotope element to another but it is never known if a particular single atom will decay at a particular time thus all atoms in the sample must be aware of the other atoms and which ones will be decaying when

575558 to have to take it all now for what the treacherous years were all the while making for and meaning is too tragic for any words
575559 i was always embarrassed by the words sacred glorious and sacrifice and the expression in vain we had heard them sometimes standing in the rain almost out of earshot so that only the shouted words came through and had read them on proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over other proclamations now for a long time and i had seen nothing sacred and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it there were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and these with the names of places were all you could say and have them mean anything abstract words such as glory honor courage or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages the numbers of roads the names of rivers the numbers of regiments and the dates

575583 llevamos bastante tiempo detr s de una fuente gamma no identificada que sin duda es la m s misteriosa de todo el cielo desde su descubrimiento en 2002 ha resistido todos los intentos de identificaci n por parte de varios equipos internacionales lo que ahora hemos podido cartografiar nos ha permitido observar que en una zona donde aparentemente no hab a objetos relevantes hayan aparecido multitud tales como galaxias con chorros bipolares regiones extendidas que radian debido a part culas cargadas en campos magn ticos e incluso estrellas peculiares que pueden ser los responsables de la emisi n de esos rayos gamma
575584 la situaci n es an loga a la ventaja que tendr a un explorador que se adentrara en territorio desconocido pero teniendo un buen mapa de antemano
575585 lo que hemos descubierto por primera vez es que la naturaleza de la materia oscura fue crucial para la formaci n de las primeras estrellas
575586 en la materia oscura fr a las part culas se mueven muy lentamente pero en la materia oscura tibia son muy r pidas
575587 hallamos que si la materia oscura est compuesta de estas part culas r pidas entonces las primeras estrellas se formaron en largos y angostos filamentos

575589 por el contrario lo que ocurre en la materia oscura fr a es muy muy distinto
575590 all las primeras estrellas se formaron como peque os bultos de materia oscura una estrella por bulto emergieron unas estrellas de gran masa unas 100 veces la masa del sol
575591 como eran tan masivas esas estrellas murieron en forma temprana no las encontrar amos hoy por hoy en la v a l ctea
575592 for several months weve found ourselves in the middle of a vicious national media firestorm
575593 the problem is that in the marketplace of ideas a k a the media they do not understand the bible view many of the attacks on us stem from this unfortunate fact
575594 for the moment i am happy to report to you that the storm has passed but i do emphasize for the moment
575595 u ltimately neither i nor any other person can know the mind of god concerning hurricane katrina i should not have suggested otherwise no matter what the cause of the storm my heart goes out to all who suffered in this terrible tragedy

575641 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
575642 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
575643 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
575644 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
575645 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
575646 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
575647 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
575648 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
575649 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
575650 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
575651 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
575652 vi ska g ra det h r i r tt ordning
575653 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
575654 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
575655 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
575656 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
575657 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
575658 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
575659 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
575660 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
575661 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
575662 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
575663 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
575664 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
575665 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
575666 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
575667 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
575668 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
575669 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
575670 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
575671 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
575672 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
575673 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
575674 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
575675 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
575676 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
575677 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
575678 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
575679 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
575680 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
575681 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
575682 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
575683 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
575684 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
575685 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
575686 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
575687 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
575688 we are now officially saying new york is in a recession
575689 i dont care but sometimes i hear my voice and its been here silent all these years
575690 ive got double the usual number of orders since the conferenced started this means our company will probably have a surplus at the end of the year and will allow us to continue strong into the next quarter
575691 i like the idea of having a baseball betting conference in our town but cant sleep at night with all them creating a rucus
575692 it wasnt so bad last year but last night i didnt get to bed until 3 am with all the shananigans going on
575693 im so thankful that many baseball betting industry heavyweights took time out to come and talk to us ive learned a lot of new things found out industry news and was able to network successfully with others who have jobs similar to mine
575694 people are buying this baseball betting stuff like hotcakes im thrilled about the success of these products
575695 im really impressed by the presentation essery lacio did about up and coming baseball betting businesses the reasoning was solid plenty of detail was provided and some of the conclusions were very provocative
575696 ive been working in the baseball betting field for years now and just expanded my operations to the internet sales have doubled in no time
575697 there are five essential points in this baseball betting study that are key
575698 i hald ento thaze while youre en the bus mate when you git off fer lodging
575699 i should have used more firepower and shot every witness and every bystander so i wouldnt get caught thats what ill do next time
575700 a corrupt 50 million contract for a thunderbirds air show
575701 i dont want the state to take a role in telling us what to do
575702 my job in district 214 is try to do the best i can for this community
575703 the people here like what the schools provide and we cant endanger that
575704 if this is the land of opportunity then we as a state and as a society have an obligation to create those opportunities for everyone as best we can
575705 would a different kind of tax be as reliable i think its still pretty unclear
575706 but at the same time we never have enough i would like to see schools all over the state funded better but im not sure at this point how wed go about it
575707 i think there would be a way to make it work without hurting the kids out here in the suburbs but wed have to put aside politics to get there
575708 as a statewide system were only as strong as our weakest link
575709 if were failing to educate children somewhere whether its st charles or chicago or anywhere in the state and we have to remediate them down the line in the prison system or elsewhere thats not a good way of doing things
575710 i am very aware and grateful for what rcl has done for my daughter and know what they do for the other clients i want to give back by helping out so that other disabled people can have the same type of help that my daughter has received
575711 most of their clients are people that would fall through the cracks if it werent for rcl because they dont fit the criteria for permanent residential living
575712 to offer adults with developmental and or physical disabilities opportunities to achieve greater self esteem dignity and participation in all aspects of community life through affordable housing options individualized skill instruction and necessary support services
575713 a person who eats sleeps and drinks rcl she is totally dedicated to the needs of our clients many of whom do not have families and to our volunteers many of whom are also clients we are a young organization we need more volunteers and we also need people who are willing to act as mentors for our clients

575717 theyre also familiar with the casual air of condescension that often emanates from the countrys political and media class and when they start to think that a presidential candidate or his party is putting on those airs they run from him in droves

575725 most experts are in agreement that its inevitable that we will become totally infested over time
575726 when that will happen i cant say its pretty grim
575727 it got here by accident and its taking advantage of the food source here
575728 this isnt the first time this kind of thing happened
575729 these things happen and its not coincidental that theyre all invasive pests that cause these things

575743 in a house where someone is dying of cancer you learn quickly to develop the silent scream
575744 we are very honest and blunt with one another if something isnt going to work wed tell each other but i felt really strongly about it she had a message and a story
575745 this is about healing and about the process of how you heal
575746 it is one persons journey of feeling and healing and getting back to life and using the experience of everyday life to express that
575747 i wish there was a way to call up there
575748 i wouldnt be sitting across from you right now if i didnt feel my mom had a hand in what i was doing

575758 hell be suspended for the first two games what he did was wrong we take it very serious and hes being punished severely for it
575759 it was really surreal at first i just thought as a baby they go under a lamp and thats what i thought would happen just take her to the hospital under some lights and everything would be normal
575760 that was the hardest part that she had a liver disease and we were on a time line and we didnt know exactly what disease it was
575761 we thought that would be ok and wed be one of the lucky ones that it would work and we didnt need a liver transplant
575762 our faith carried us through that everything would be ok
575763 the pain of me loosing my daughter thats something that would never go away but the physical pain it will go away

575765 this came out of an investigation that was done by the auditor that came up i guess the speaker and the president was notified about some of these findings and i guess the board

575767 its an issue between the hta board of directors and rex johnson we have no comment
575768 this was a huge error in judgment on my part and i am willing to abide by what the board decides
575769 it could be warranted i am hoping that the board understands that everyone of us needs a plan we want to know whats going on and how they are going to respond
575770 he has been an exemplary public servant for a very long period of time especially in this climate now when we see our economy slowing and tourism is still the major economic engine
575771 now that it is open to the public i think that rex should have his due process and that the board should deliberate as a whole body and make the determination as to whats the in the best interest of the state

575784 ms couillard may have put herself in jeopardy of having contravened a provision of the security of information act
575785 its a report done at the request of mr bernier for the benefit of mr bernier so im not surprised that the interpretations of these people went in that direction
575786 it has to be acknowledged that the incident itself was injurious to tarnishing canadas good reputation within nato circles for safeguarding classified information
575787 there was no occasion or reason for mr bernier to open his briefcase and he does not have any recollection of opening it during his stay at ms couillards
575788 the fact that they didnt interview ms couillard means that the report is frankly useless
575789 what they are seemingly trying to do here is to put the blame almost entirely on mme couillard

575804 back in the 70s and 80s there was a tactical response group but of course they were never kitted out to this extreme
575805 there would have been perhaps an improvised army helmet an old type ballistic vest and a remington 870 pump action shotgun not much else
575806 far more dangerous place than it was 20 years ago
575807 what we are wearing is a direct reflection of society today i have seen an escalation in violence towards police and a loss of respect for law enforcement in general
575808 we get called to public disturbances brawls sieges riots protests and demonstrations but we are fully prepared for any other high risk scenario that could possibly come our way
575809 if its a situation like a redfern or a macquarie fields riot the last thing youre thinking about is the additional weight its never a consideration youre totally focused
575810 if they are heading out in the full kit its based upon the risk of the threat confronting us at the time
575811 we had significant intelligence that there were people intent on causing violence and damage

575817 pourquoi ne pourrai je pas faire des remplacements comme vendeuse ou occuper tout autre emploi
575818 we would pick what we could send back paper adjustments and then they would have to make adjustments and send that information back to us the entire process was essentially manual
575819 as far as that system knew every item in our warehouse had one location where it was stored but in reality we would have that item in two or three places things were just getting scattered and we had no real control or visibility into our inventory
575820 we had a lot of big deep locations that would hold twelve pallets we had gone over to a system called bailment where the vendors actually own what is in our warehouse so a lot of them started doing vendor managed inventory where they were keeping track of how much was in our warehouse the process became a little closer to just in time jit where they would have just a couple of weeks supply the issue was that these big deep locations were meant to hold a couple months worth instead of a couple of weeks so we had a lot of space that was assigned to an item that wasnt being utilized
575821 our product line was in the beginning of an expansion period that still continues to this day
575822 we were reaching the point where we were going to start shipping orders incomplete because we were not able to get items to the pick locations in time to meet the shipments
575823 we were spending a lot of time looking for things there was a pretty high cost i had two to three employees that were spending all of their time looking for the stuff and other people were picking up their work so the work level had increased dramatically for everybody but we werent seeing any increased productivity and in fact we were losing opportunity
575824 after looking at the various products on the market robocom was the only vendor that had exactly what we were looking for and they provided us with answers to all of our questions rims was a really good fit for our needs
575825 we completed the implementation in half the time of robocoms previous shortest install it took just 16 weeks from start to acceptance and it was really much shorter than that because there were four weeks at the end where we were up and running and doing some little debugging once we switched over to live testing we never went back user adoption has been very successful within days everyone was using the system and we were immediately seeing efficiency improvements
575826 as soon as an item is received on the floor our legacy system knows and it has been added to that inventory so we have immediate visibility
575827 as we pick it then creates more replenishment not for the orders but to keep minimum stock levels at each of the pick locations a crucial step for maintaining our efficiency levels and meeting customer demand
575828 everything that is done with our distribution center is done with rims
575829 if we move a product from one spot on the floor to another we scan it from one location to another so all of our receipts all of our product movement all of our order fulfillment they are all done with rims
575830 previously we shipped about 1 8 million cases per year and this year we are projecting we will do about 2 8 million we can attribute that dramatic change to the fact that we are running a more efficient business there is no way we could be getting that much out the door if we werent using rims
575831 we are shipping a million more cases a year and at the same time also receiving a million more so that is two million more cases that we are actually managing to only add eight employees over six years while realizing that kind of growth is phenomenal
575832 i can go into a screen in rims and i can call up an item and i can look and see how many cases we have in each location how much movement there is planned whether it is just re warehouse movement or picks to fulfill an order i can look at the receiving floor and see how many pallets are there waiting to be stored i can look at individual orders for today tomorrow if an agent calls with a question about an order i can immediately look it up and give them the information they need the system gives me everything i need at my fingertips there is no more guessing or hunting for inventory we now have total control over our warehouse
575833 we gained a 33 efficiency increase meaning we are able to store 33 more despite losing 25 of our physical storage space
575834 rims is flexible enough that all of our additional physical changes have been very easily accommodated by rims to give us that visibility
575835 we have some deliveries that arent being made until 4 00 or 5 00 in the evening because we only ship out of one door
575836 we have 1100 cases an hour we are able to ship out the door but the more cases we have it just makes for that much longer of a day so we are looking at adding sortation to our conveyer system
575837 robocom has put us in contact with some vendors and they are helping us try to solve this issue and meet our goals that is the benefit of working with robocom they have become a true partner for the long haul i feel very lucky that we found robocom they are such a good fit i am very thankful that things have worked out as nicely as they have
575838 previously we shipped about 1 8 million cases per year and this year we are projecting we will do about 2 8 million we can attribute that dramatic change to the fact that we are running a more efficient business there is no way we could be getting that much out the door if we werent using rims
575839 we are shipping a million more cases a year and at the same time also receiving a million more so that is two million more cases that we are actually managing to only add eight employees over six years while realizing that kind of growth is phenomenal

575906 the beijing olympics is an opportunity once in a hundred years but when i am in the competition i will think of it as nothing more than an ordinary competition
575907 but one lesson ive learned is to keep it simple
575908 oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory that your hand be with me that you would keep me from evil that i may not cause pain
575909 the increase in knowledge is forcing people to specialize as a result the distance between fields of specialization has become so vast that specialists in different areas are rarely able to influence each other
575910 during the past year alta manufacturing had thirty percent more on the job accidents than nearby panoply industries where the work shifts are one hour shorter than ours experts believe that a significant contributing factor in many on the job accidents is fatigue and sleep deprivation among workers therefore to reduce the number of on the job accidents at alta and thereby increase productivity we should shorten each of our three work shifts by one hour so that our employees will get adequate amounts of sleep
575911 most experts are in agreement that its inevitable that we will become totally infested over time
575912 when that will happen i cant say its pretty grim
575913 it got here by accident and its taking advantage of the food source here
575914 this isnt the first time this kind of thing happened
575915 these things happen and its not coincidental that theyre all invasive pests that cause these things
575916 ash is a very popular tree because it has a lot of qualities that make it a good tree for landscaping
575917 there is no saving the tree once you start seeing symptoms its kind of too late
575918 i dont want the state to take a role in telling us what to do
575919 my job in district 214 is try to do the best i can for this community
575920 the people here like what the schools provide and we cant endanger that
575921 if this is the land of opportunity then we as a state and as a society have an obligation to create those opportunities for everyone as best we can
575922 would a different kind of tax be as reliable i think its still pretty unclear
575923 but at the same time we never have enough i would like to see schools all over the state funded better but im not sure at this point how wed go about it
575924 i think there would be a way to make it work without hurting the kids out here in the suburbs but wed have to put aside politics to get there
575925 as a statewide system were only as strong as our weakest link
575926 if were failing to educate children somewhere whether its st charles or chicago or anywhere in the state and we have to remediate them down the line in the prison system or elsewhere thats not a good way of doing things
575927 the investigation is still ongoing and it should reach a conclusion in the next couple of days
575928 die gegend ist eine kriegszone wir verlangen dort eine waffenruhe damit wir sie freilassen k nnen

575930 behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world
575931 how can i do this great wickedness and sin against god
575932 how to get the biggest band for 10 billion bucks
575933 it just goes to show what can be done when the boating public the marine industry and its representatives in congress row together in a bipartisan way

575935 when you come to the border hold your card up to your window and on the border patrol screen up will pop your name your picture the fact that you are a u s citizen and the number of your card theyll peek in to see if youre the same person and speed you on your way
575936 if you live in a border community and you regularly go back and forth across the border whether its many times a week or many times a month or several times a year the passport card makes sense
575937 oh so youre doing this to overcome your fear of heights
575938 we just thought it was a blast up in alaska
575939 and we started thinking boy wouldnt it be cool to have something like this in ohio
575940 it was all built last winter with six to eight guys working in the trees six days a week
575941 while youre not going to see parrots or monkeys like you might on a canopy tour in costa rica the hocking river valley offers similar thrills and spectacular views and its located right in americas heartland
575942 its easy to forget about the beautiful deciduous forests right in our own backyard
575943 i love the game and its good to see my friends
575944 weve always had lots of great blue herons around especially on the island just south of the plant
575945 but this osprey nest has caused quite a stir i find it amazing they built a nest on a coal barge unloader because it really vibrates when being used
575946 they flew by grabbed a branch with their talons and snapped it off in flight
575947 jogging strollers are good but it gets to be difficult
575948 you use more energy because usually youre holding onto the stroller with one hand so youre only able to use one of your arms to pump you dont get the same flow when youre running with one arm
575949 its definitely heavy but i think its the best workout i could get and its great because i have my children with me
575950 i dont know that everything is going to go back the way it was completely
575951 but i just feel happier when im outside exercising and getting fresh air and i think it makes mila happier too
575952 i dont know how much shes going to love being in the stroller for long periods of time because now shes walking
575953 this kids been walking two days and shes already running
575954 i think she was just hot and miserable in that stupid snowsuit
575955 i plan to run a 5k every month for as long as possible
575956 that circle has expanded to about a five hour drive from a three hour drive
575957 even if it was 10 meters it would be important
575958 id agree that the current state of schema management in storm is not that great i e it is non existent however i believe that schema generation as found in django is not the right solution a migration framework is what is needed for long lived applications e g like ruby on rails

575960 the chart above shows historical sea level data derived from 23 tide gauge measurements the chart on the right shows the average sea level since 1993 derived from global satellite measurements updated here monthly sea level rise is associated with the thermal expansion of sea water due to climate warming and widespread melting of land ice
575961 a semi empirical approach to projecting future sea level rise
575962 sedimentary rocks contain the largest mass of organic carbon on earth but these reservoirs are not well integrated into modern carbon budgets
575963 since we need to know the budget of the natural carbon cycle in order to determine human climate impacts this information will lead to more accurate climate modeling
575964 this was the most surprising finding in the study since these bacteria are adapted to digest organic matter from things like leaves and acorns which is similar to carbohydrates consumed by humans
575965 the presence of microorganisms capable of using kerogen may have significant implications for the global scale cycling of carbon and oxygen
575966 we have found outcrops of the new albany shale which is usually black that have turned a light brown color as bacteria consume carbon where the overlying soil meets the weathered rock
575967 we cant possibly sell the idea of green taxes to voters during a downturn
575968 the question is whether the party will keep its nerve about doing things that will be uncomfortable for consumers at the moment the jury is out
575969 other than those two record temperatures it was a pretty unspectacular month as far as weather was concerned
575970 global warming increases the probabilities of floods and strong hurricanes and that is all that you can say
575971 the intensity has not really been excessive on a short term scale
575972 climate shift to unprecedentedly dry weather along with diversion of water for irrigation has converted this former reservoir in chinas minqin county into desert
575973 your problem is not global warming your problem is that youre nuts
575974 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
575975 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
575976 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
575977 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
575978 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
575979 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

575996 weve got to be strong enough mentally to overcome and bounce back i have confidence
575997 i dont know if i could go out there and try to give up 14 hits buehrle said after his era jumped from 3
575998 it seemed like i was making my pitches and they were hitting them and at times i was missing my spots and they were hitting them pretty hard it was just one of those days today
575999 dont get me wrong i was pretty beat out there buehrle said
576000 but both teams had to deal with it i like pitching in hot weather but today was pretty ridiculous this is one of those days where you wanted to have a quick game and get the guys back in the dugout because it was so hot out there
576001 falling behind in the count a lot of basehits i didnt do anything good today
576002 weve got a better club but if were not pitching i dont care how many juniors were going to bring here weve got to start pitching better if were going to win a lot of people think its out there in the bullpen but youve got to drive the ball before you can putt it
576003 everything starts with the starters you sit there and the starters dont go long then youve got to go to the bullpen in baseball if you dont pitch youre not going to win
576004 its tough to battle back but these guys all nine innings they didnt give up buehrle said
576005 they kept battling back and made it a close game
576006 i dont know why ive got the feeling guillen said
576007 with the lineup we have i think paulies going to come out and start swinging the bat well last night i got that feeling
576008 everybody was so excited for him everybodys feeling for him and everybody wants him to do good
576009 im just trying to help the team win that day konerko said

576011 i want to keep paulie fresh and make sure we dont forget about him like i said earlier paulies a big part of the ballclub and hopefully having junior he doesnt have to carry the load we have people who can help him hopefully it works out you never know whats going to happen
576012 i dont want to put guys on the shelf and forget about them guilen said

576022 50 hedge fund mangers who made a combined 29 billion is one of my favorite barack obama campaign stories

576027 i am looking forward to coming in here and helping this team as much as i can i want to get into that end zone and help this team get some more touchdowns
576028 it doesnt necessarily have to be right in the middle but at some point hes going to run through the middle of the field and catch the ball near it or on it in traffic and make plays for us if hes going to be a premier receiver in the national football league
576029 hes got the willingness and hes never shown us that he doesnt hes working awfully hard at it
576030 i like his attitude i like his approach to the game
576031 hes very confident he has like quiet confidence he definitely wants to come in here and score some touchdowns and help us out
576032 it was just something that i had to get through
576033 i am happy to be here as part of the buffalo bills organization and contribute this season

576035 my friend joy florczak is a wonderful caddie and said sometimes thats a good omen but it kind of followed me out there
576036 i was looking for my swing on the front nine i was very uncomfortable
576037 just a little bit not where i get down on myself just where i tell myself to get it together
576038 lucky for me that it turned around i was very fortunate it was a hard fought battle and lisa was really striking the ball well
576039 youve always got to keep the next shot ahead of you its been exciting for me
576040 i just love the backside on this course my game came back together
576041 it was exciting it was okay until the last hole i thought i gave up some opportunities
576042 im not a real long hitter so its really important for me to be straight
576043 my chipping and pitching were great my putting was a little suspect but we worked through that and got over it
576044 its always been a goal but when i reached 45 or 46 my goal was i wanted to win this thing before i turn 50 well we all know that ive turned 50 but i dont care this is something to emigrate its my first win in the district its sweet no matter what it is
576045 maggie played very steady didnt make many errors it was a good match

576047 when you face these kinds of global problems you need as prime minister someone who is respected on the international stage
576048 someone whose hard work and ability over the last 11 years has made britain better off
576049 thats why ive no doubt that gordon brown is the right person for the job
576050 i think gordon brown understands where the problems are coming from better than anybody else in british politics and what we are going to do about them
576051 political mountain to climb in order to win the next election
576052 multitude of small policies are more suited to a sunday afternoon stroll

576064 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
576065 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
576066 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
576067 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
576068 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
576069 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
576070 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
576071 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
576072 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
576073 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
576074 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people

576078 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
576079 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
576080 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
576081 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
576082 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
576083 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
576084 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members

576216 our lord wants us to be in the world and to love the world but without being worldly our lord wants us to remain in this world which is now so mixed up and where the clamor of lust and disobedience and purposeless rebellion can be heard to teach people to live with joy dont be afraid of the paganized world our lord has in fact chosen us to be leaven salt and light in this world dont be worried the world wont harm you unless you want it to no enemy of our soul can do anything if we dont consent and we wont consent with the grace of god and the protection of our mother in heaven
576217 this is a lonely place and the day is now over send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves
576218 they need not go away you give them something to eat

576225 one thing you can say about printmaking is that its one of the most democratic forms of art making if you want to buy a painting you can buy an artist signed print from an edition of 100 its a lot more accessible to a lot more people a signed print means the artist proofed it and they approved it
576226 its limitless what you can do at ccp from traditional to unusual printmaking i havent yet scratched the surface of the many classes and teachers that are there
576227 someone is always around to help and be open to what im doing
576228 he came out from behind a door and the audience gave him a standing ovation
576229 everyone was so supportive and friendly i started editioning my wood cut prints in 2000 and im now working on large scale wood cuts primarily
576230 i had very little printmaking experience and tony and chris have helped me get whats inside my head and out and onto six to nine foot pieces
576231 you could say that ccp is the public print facility that has the most to offer between new york and boston it pulls in hundreds of people a year
576232 we have an outreach here for classes after school and we approach students the same way as we do famous artists
576233 we do tons and tons of outreach to teens teens working here recently collaborated with a production of julius caesar by shakespeare on the sound using linoleum cuts to make banners they decided exactly what they wanted and hung the banners during the play
576234 for the first time in september the cottage will house international printmaker vladimire zuev from the ural mountains in siberia
576235 he will be there for two weeks and will work with area high school students and ccp members
576236 we take about 20 folks to the print fair at the armory
576237 we also have a walk and talk program where for six exhibitions a year an artist talks about their work its all a lot of fun
576238 this play celebrates the connection of two people who seem disparate
576239 she seems to tell him we come from the same place you and i the trick is she manages to make that point in a very subtle way and still delivers on the notion of a romantic thriller and surprises us at every turn
576240 we got the opportunity to get to the soul of these characters without building the distance that comes with the details of staging a period piece
576241 there is a contemporary hook where you feel the souls of two people brought together by happenstance
576242 even though tryst is written as a period piece i dont see that it is too dependent on the period
576243 put all those trappings aside and what you have what you find is how these people find each other and how they express themselves to each other
576244 the dichotomy they have going the problems of adelaide of low self esteem trap her in a way
576245 the perceived weaknesses of adelaide rooted in poor self esteem seem to trap her
576246 in a sense during the first part of the play i see the audience should be a step ahead
576247 nothing is a revelation we know whats coming he is a standard con man after all also the action is taking place inside their minds idealized versions of what we see
576248 during the second part when they are in the room together the anticipation breaks down so nothing turns out the way either expected here they are a step ahead of the narrative
576249 i hope i have the audience thinking shes more than what they think
576250 just when they think theyre in on it theyre not
576251 it is a litmus test for compassion in the audience for two wounded people how do audience members respond thats what theater is
576252 would give president bush the authority to round up american citizens as enemy combatants potentially stripping them of their civil liberties
576253 the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great
576254 that is why i have banned the import of these cats immediately

576256 i sincerely hope really bad things happen to you in proportion to the poison you spread on the net unless you repent and id still spit on you
576257 how does it feel to be the best player never to have won a wgc
576258 i didnt give too many away its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole golf tournament i need to play a solid round tomorrow
576259 youve just got to make a bunch of birdies he shot 10 under on friday obviously it could be done
576260 it was my first time having a lead i didnt really approach it the right way im a different player now then i was then just with the control of my game
576261 that one i looked past the finish line too early this one im looking at the first shot on the first hole and thats as far as im going to go
576262 i didnt think i was going to get it to the green i only flew my drive 200 yards it must have rolled another 150
576263 everything has just been real solid its nice to have control of my golf ball you know tiger woods gets it a lot but to have control its really fun and i am just having a lot of fun just playing golf right now
576264 i thought it was going to be the worst birthday ever after three holes
576265 i felt like my tournament had just ended right there
576266 most of the guys i dated were captivated by my heart but they had different ways of trying to get to me tony understands me
576267 he appreciates my talent hes the first person ive spiritually connected with
576268 hell say jessica 75 of the comments about your new single are favorable
576269 i didnt try anything to change my life other than dating different types of guys and conforming to their worlds i thought i had to be artsier more intellectual
576270 lord make haste to help me lord make speed to save me
576271 i know that make haste to help me part thats a nice alliterative rejoinder make speed to save me all day long eh
576272 a situation came up with my family and i need weekends off to go see them
576273 lord make haste to help me lord make speed to save me
576274 glory to god in the highest and peace on earth to men of good will
576275 when was the last time youve seen one of these
576276 they gave pledges that we would be able to report without restrictions that we would be able to travel anywhere in china and uplink anywhere in china the same conditions as had applied in previous olympic games and patently that is not happening
576277 nobody stopped them or asked them to leave during their shooting
576278 move in the direction to give you the widest access possible
576279 were putting together good at bats winning solves a lot
576280 it seems like the guys are turning the page and having fun
576281 you can see different approaches in the dugout how guys are just going up there having fun swinging the bat playing hard
576282 its so nice to score early and put up a crooked number and then do it again and spread it out give ourselves some breathing room
576283 we have quietly been working on sustainability issues at duke for about a decade
576284 its going to be a yearly rating were hoping to rate more schools
576285 i can guarantee he will be the first name on the team sheet
576286 hes fitted right in with the guys and hes got confidence hes got a little bit of arrogance which i think you need as a striker
576287 hes got all of the ingredients i dont want to put too much pressure on him but weve definitely got something to work with
576288 im a forward and i get paid to score goals the fans are expecting a lot out of me and i welcome that pressure good players thrive on pressure
576289 i think im a good finisher i get behind the defence and hopefully i can bring a bit of experience to the forward line
576290 weve got a 6 7 4 record and ive been on teams who have only won 10 games in a season and got into the playoffs were in good shape and can still make the post season
576291 its difficult being without four key players but the injection of chad barrett coming in has given everyone a lift
576292 doing whatever necessary to make you the healthiest member of the body of christ
576293 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
576294 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections
576295 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
576296 a 40 percent decline in price would have put most developing countries into bankruptcy the issue was one of very survival
576297 i hope that if obama gets elected there will be a new commitment to multilateralism
576298 i hope that obama will realise how important multilateralism is and will resume the talks on a more reasonable basis
576299 by having a lot of issues raised in the same forum it is easier to find a compromise

576303 after ruling out other diseases and clinical conditions that could cause gastro intestinal disorders and after interpreting the babys growth chart for consistent development i have found that manual spinal adjustments bring about a significant reduction in an infants crying followed by better sleeping patterns and an improvement in posture
576304 chiropractic provides a maintenance program for ones nervous system that allows the human body to operate at peak efficiently
576305 if the body is free of nerve interference it promotes health providing chiropractic to an infant and continuing through adulthood is the true definition of health care taking steps to ensure health instead of waiting for pain or illness
576306 there are three types of stress that impact how our bodies perform psychological stress is commonly enhanced by money problems struggling relationships or issues at work our ability to deal with those problems has a positive impact on our bodies physical stress is remedied by how we care for our bodies through exercise etc the children described in the study battled bio chemical stress fueled by what they put into their bodies the food and medicines we intake directly affect how we function

576310 childhood asthma is a prevalent in the united states with nine million people under the age of 18 suffering from this debilitating lung ailment four times as many as 20 years ago
576311 for some this leads to a lifetime of suffering or for those less fortunate death there are approximately 5 000 deaths annually in the u s that are linked to asthma after reading about dr fedorchuks research i wanted to do more for those in my community who fight respiratory ailments
576312 the use of technology identifies areas of disturbance in the nervous system that could be caused by stress trauma or toxins asthmatics have more frequent incidents of misalignment of the upper and lower thoracic region which is the area of the shoulders and below

576314 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
576315 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
576316 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
576317 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
576318 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
576319 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
576320 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
576321 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
576322 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
576323 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
576324 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
576325 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
576326 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
576327 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
576328 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
576329 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
576330 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
576331 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
576332 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
576333 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
576334 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
576335 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
576336 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
576337 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
576338 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
576339 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
576340 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
576341 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
576342 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
576343 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
576344 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
576345 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
576346 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
576347 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
576348 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
576349 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
576350 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
576351 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
576352 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
576353 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
576354 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
576355 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
576356 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
576357 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
576358 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
576359 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
576360 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
576361 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
576362 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
576363 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
576364 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
576365 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
576366 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
576367 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
576368 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
576369 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
576370 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
576371 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
576372 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
576373 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
576374 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
576375 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
576376 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
576377 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
576378 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
576379 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
576380 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
576381 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
576382 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
576383 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
576384 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
576385 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
576386 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
576387 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
576388 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
576389 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
576390 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
576391 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
576392 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
576393 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
576394 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
576395 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
576396 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
576397 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
576398 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
576399 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
576400 who are open to doing something on the production side
576401 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
576402 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
576403 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
576404 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

576415 i brought them home strapped to the puddingmobile like a vietnamese farmer
576416 they were terrified but it was good preparation for their next challenge surviving life with the rooster
576417 then eventually one of them just said fuck it im getting on with life and she started to explore a little peck around her the other two stayed huddled its amazing these animals dont know anything and yet their personalities are distinct
576418 he started to peck in small circles like he was showing them what to do and eventually they got it though theyd never seen an adult before they relaxed they even started pecking his beak in some kind of feeding behavior and he let them he was looking out for them
576419 i thought here we go the blood bath has begun the chick was screaming and the other two were freaked but then he let her go and she wasnt hurt it looked something like a cat shaking her kittens
576420 in a couple of months theyll be mature but who knows if he has the foresight to see them for the bodacious pullets they could turn into if he leaves them alone
576421 where three babies get dumped on some single guy and hes clueless and he grumbles but in his own way he looks after them
576422 yeah but its the busy of a badly run restaurant kitchen
576423 lot of activity lot of bumping into each other but not much is getting done
576424 third prize patty pan squash olivia kohler age 7 santa cruz
576425 similar donkeys and llamas leave their droppings in the same spot every day
576426 hes three years old hes not going to grow any more im totally used to taking care of him
576427 when i was about 5 i really liked spongebob squarepants and i started getting his stuff now i have 23 things my favorite is the krusty krab model luis sandoval age 7 watsonville
576428 shed taken to roosting in a tree after a raccoon attack in the coop probably a coyote got her lot of them up there in the mountains
576429 in the wild it would make sense for him to keep attacking the dominant rooster will eventually get old and feeble but for now he needs to have some fear of me or well never be able to feed the chickens
576430 last night i opened a cabernet and sat watching the chickens scratch around by the house she feels considerable entitlement to hand feeding of treats like pinhead oatmeal so often jumps up on the table and glares at me until i put out this time though she was distracted picking at the wine bottle and so on a lark i tipped my glass toward her and with only brief hesitation she put her beak in there emerged shaking her head then straight back in lapping it up after a minute i took the glass away but im sure she would have licked it dry as it was her beard and cheeks were soaked with wine and she looked lit and dishevelled like any young englishwoman at the pub
576431 privacy policy and user agreement fact is most of these companies require you to pay a small shipping handling charge then stick your credit card with charges every month afterward between 29
576432 which is weird because it hasnt been normal for a while and i wasnt expecting it to it felt completely normal
576433 felt like a real finger not like it was jammed
576434 you catch the ball 30 yards downfield hes all of a sudden right there trying to strip it out
576435 not quite as much as i used to because when youre calling every play its hard to run down the field and get back because youre holding things up
576436 i was definitely excited when al got hired because i knew the expectations offensively was going to go here
576437 from meetings to walk throughs all that stuff will pick up because his thing is the way you practice is the way youre going to play
576438 unlike that 99 super bowl championship team were not good enough to just line up on sunday and lets go we have to practice those habits to get to that point where were dominant its almost like hes nursing a new baby
576439 you have to make sure you come to practice focused and ready to go every day
576440 we have a new protection new formations new plays every day
576441 my first coaching job was sophomore football coach at gunn high school in palo alto calif
576442 we tell the receivers what to do by numbers and the backs what to do by words and the offensive linemen what to do by schemes
576443 as part of that on every play every player is told what to do either in digit form or in word form and because of that you have a tremendous ability to expand exponentially the number of things that you do
576444 if a receiver can count from one to nine it doesnt matter what everybody else is doing he knows the route tree
576445 really i could teach you in 15 minutes you could come out here as the x receiver and you could probably run 90 percent of the pass plays and end up in the right spot
576446 he has to be a real bright guy in terms of analyzing the progressions and the system and the protections and all the things he has to learn
576447 dan fouts could come in here today and take team work
576448 he probably is at one end of dons offense joe gibbs is probably at the other end
576449 i felt like i made almost all my pitches you always say you wont get beat by the solo home run but i did today its not a good feeling
576450 every mistake ive thrown to him hes hit it out of the ballpark
576451 i went into the game not wanting ryan howard to beat me and he kind of beat me it doesnt matter how you throw the ball if you lose 2 1 i couldve made a couple better pitches and we couldve been all right
576452 anytime youve got a guy like this where almost the entire team hasnt faced him especially if hes on its going to be tough
576453 i think we were a little too defensive the first half of the game cardinals manager tony la russa said
576454 typically youre going to beat a guy like that on 10 11 or 12 hits glaus said
576455 hes not going to walk guys hes not going to get behind he threw more swing and miss pitches today the slider was different it was something i hadnt seen before
576456 he had a different off speed pitch and he had different speeds on his fastball usually hes more of a four seam fastball guy tonight he threw everything
576457 i thought hed give us a better chance to get a bunt down
576458 if its lefthander schumaker against lefthander you know hes going to bunt weve got a couple other options with izturis
576459 actually letting him out of practice about 15 minutes early
576460 when i went to put on his tie he had buttoned up the shirt one off
576461 i always had trouble getting into first gear especially on hills
576462 if you can see the look on his face it is just so purely happy
576463 i think it is about time someone else takes the responsibility and i am happy to pass the baton on to someone i know that i am sure that i inspired
576464 there is nothing bad about that it is only positive
576465 i would expect in beijing that you are going to see him win by margins and set times that have never been done before
576466 i hope he does it but i think the odds are against him
576467 there are always upsets in sports and my guess is theres going to be an upset in beijing
576468 you not only do your best time and break his old world record you are still looking at his feet
576469 it makes it really difficult for his competitors to think they can stop this momentum
576470 theres always that risk of someone false starting or the team that tries to get them in the finals doesnt get there
576471 so many things had to go right with my story to happen and that there is something that had to go wrong with someone else
576472 i really felt like they were taking bricks off of my back and the load was getting easier
576473 if he doesnt do it then it was meant not to be
576474 mizzou finished fifth nationally in total offense ninth in passing offense and eighth in scoring offense a year ago
576475 we got overshadowed by the offense but thats to be expected as long as you win the ballgame
576476 we have a system thats been pretty good to us but we can do more with the types of coverages and blitzes
576477 last year we started out real general because we didnt have the experience and then we expanded on it they did a good job with the principles of the defense now we want to put a lot on their plate early in two a days and see what they can handle
576478 experience helps but were going to be looking at every single rep in practice making sure guys are playing with a competitive edge and tough physically were going to micromanage the effort and the intensity
576479 obviously he had a lot of sacks for us and tackles for loss he anchored down the line but jaron played a lot last year he worked his butt off during spring ball and he has an outstanding attitude
576480 once they get into pads i think theyre going to be fine
576481 coach eberflus looks at what hes got and knows how to draw things up if hes got a safety that can blitz or a linebacker that can drop back in coverage he knows what hes got
576482 if we let chase throw on us all day it breaks us but if we stop them it makes us it comes down to competition
576483 our offense has got their back our guys and our team we dont look at it that way were a big family
576484 its a new world order they are trying to create

576494 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
576495 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
576496 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
576497 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
576498 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
576499 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
576500 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
576501 were talking about having a shot at him by week four week five certainly for our bye week which comes in week seven
576502 were going to get him for the last 10 games of our regular season and hopefully we earn our way beyond that
576503 i havent seen stars in this city in such a long time

576505 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about

576518 when water gets warm 75 80 degrees bass can be anywhere but i generally start shallow
576519 theyll often be sitting within 3 feet of shore the big fish will hold amazingly tight to shore in warm weather its a great ambush point for them
576520 property you couldnt give away 20 years ago is now going for millions
576521 a lot of people stay up here on weekends but id say just 5 percent of them fish most of them like the wildlife they like looking at the water
576522 but the water quality isnt as good ive never gotten bass of any real size there

576525 you can see how the grass strains the sediment how much clearer it is where the weeds are

576527 walleyes like it a little deeper when water gets warm
576528 they like the heavier riffles in 2 3 4 feet of water where theres rocks that break down the current and give them ambush points
576529 for the size of the water it doesnt get much pressure you can be out here on a weekday and not see another boat
576530 the middle allegheny is one of the last remaining examples of the kind of rivers that once existed in the ohio basin and are now gone
576531 in particular it provides habitat for rare mussels and rare fishes that have been extirpated from a lot of their original ranges across multiple states
576532 ive had 100 fish days out here and ive caught smallies down to 37 degree water temperatures which is pretty much pushing the limit
576533 it can be easier to read especially in summer when features jump out at you
576534 it can also be more challenging theres a lot of water a lot of options and its dynamic always changing

576550 incompatible with essential values of the french community particularly the principle of equality of the sexes
576551 i t is not a religious insignia but the insignia of a totalitarian political project that promotes inequality between the sexes and is totally lacking in democracy

576559 time will tell there is always room for improvement and that will come to pass i am now focusing on the olympics

576561 the young generation of chinese gymnasts are really capable with very high starting scores on degree of difficulties but it is also a risk
576562 the gymnastics is all about on site performance so their biggest rivals will not be the americans but themselves
576563 competing on home soil will surely be an advantage no matter where i compete i will keep a calm mood to reduce mistakes and bring out my abilities
576564 every little bit helps especially when it comes to clothes
576565 a 5 t shirt one year ago costs you 25 dollars now
576566 every bit of money i have goes in my gas tank
576567 it helps because the prices are just a flat rate

576606 las retenciones que contin an siendo confiscatorias y las restricciones tales como los registros de exportaci n los plazos de embarques los precios ndices entre otros impiden el normal desenvolvimiento del comercio exterior
576607 el campo contribuy a devolverle el protagonismo a las instituciones fundamentales de la rep blica

576612 es muy dif cil saber lo que va a hacer alguien con la mente que parece que tiene de juana el s bado saldr a la calle y a partir de ese momento estar en libertad lo que no quiere decir que pueda hacer todo lo que tenga pensado hacer porque es evidente que hay cosas que no le vamos a dejar hacer como faltar el respeto a las v ctimas
576613 este individuo como a todos los ciudadanos al presidente del gobierno le genera una sensaci n perfectamente entendible de desprecio
576614 nos hicimos la idea de que los chicos tambi n hab an sido asesinados pero al enterarnos fue el golpe m s fuerte de nuestras vidas no entiendo no me entra en la cabeza c mo puede haber tanto salvajismo

576618 el f tbol es una actividad que considero superior porque debe ser la nica donde el hombre no usa las manos eso le da una originalidad incre ble

576629 volver a a hacer todas y cada una de las cosas que hice
576630 porque por primera vez las instituciones de la democracia nos hemos puesto a discutir una ley que tocaba la redistribuci n del ingreso en la argentina
576631 nunca se vio desde la recuperaci n de la democracia hasta ahora un nivel de virulencia de lock out patronal y cortes de rutas
576632 la discusi n no tiene que ver con que estemos unidos o desunidos sino con qu modelo econ mico nos vamos a desarrollar
576633 es financiado por un grupo de bancos y la empresa alstom y creo que va a ser importante
576634 fue a mi criterio manejado pol tica o medi ticamente no quiero cargar las tintas sobre conspiraciones sino que hay intereses pol ticos y econ micos que se entrecruzan en procesos democr ticos y la argentina no est exenta
576635 dios m o creo que un secretario de comercio no define cambios per se por qu hay que satanizar a los funcionarios en todo caso me parece demasiado reduccionista el criterio de responsabilizar a un funcionario a los funcionarios hay que juzgarlos por su gesti n de acuerdo con las instrucciones que emanan de la presidenta
576636 que por ejemplo hoy sea candidato a presidente de los estados unidos un hombre de color como el senador obama alguien que me ha sorprendido por su personalidad su discurso su forma de enfocar las cosas

576641 im in a great frame of mind why wouldnt i be im with a new team a great bunch of guys im looking forward to getting this season on the road and actually looking forward to going into next week and try to put everything together as a team and as an offense
576642 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
576643 we hospitalize in hopes that youll die but if you pay the price we will save your life

576646 zelfs een stolk in een rolstoel is nog de beste speler van ons team
576647 het kampioenschap blijkt toch een te opportunistische gedachte te zijn geweest

576676 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
576677 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

576690 what do you mean cobb bagged twelve birds and didnt miss
576691 i see no reason in the world why we shouldnt compete with colored athletes as long as they conduct themselves with politeness and gentility let me say also that no white man has the right to be less of a gentleman than a colored man in my book that goes not only for baseball but in all walks of life
576692 i like them negro race personally when i was little i had a colored mammy i played with colored children
576693 we came out of the theatre and mr cobb like a father was waiting on the other side of the road
576694 as we were getting into the car mr cobb overheard the owner of a nearby restaurant explaining to a man dressed in shabby clothes how to get to the linwood hospital a veterans hospital mr cobb interrupts and says son ill take you there
576695 the man stood on the running board of mr cobbs la salle coupe and they were talking back and forth and this man was a veteran of world war i when they pulled up to the gate at the linwood hospital i saw mr cobb hand this man a 20 bill herschel was looking off at somewhere else but i saw what mr cobb done it was incidents like this that never made it to the press
576696 so far chandler has lived up to everything that i thought he could do as a commissioner to me every one of his decisions have been fair
576697 youve ask me about this cobb educational fund and now im going to have to answer it i do not wish to be eulogized for what i have done im proud of it yes this educational fund has given me the greatest possible happiness and pleasure and maybe when im gone well have some real great men developed out of the cobb educational foundation
576698 negroes had done and were doing a good deal for the up building of the state and i am in favor of allowing them money for education
576699 even if it would have been a gal ah would have named her the same
576700 i wasnt exactly against the tigers but i still had to be for mr ty
576701 but i cant sit and allow people to say such negative remarks such as cobb was a racist without at least trying to educate the public on the absolute truth
576702 i like them personally when i was little i had a colored mammy i played with colored children
576703 when you view a cluster in google news theres a new option to filter sources you can restrict news articles to blogs and to local news sites that are relevant to your query the filters are a good way to find opinionated articles and more up to date information from local sites
576704 i believe separating blogs and news will clarify the objective and subjective information
576705 in the next 10 years the whole world of media communications and advertising are going to be turned upside down my opinion here are the premises i have number one there will be no media consumption left in 10 years that is not delivered over an ip network there will be no newspapers no magazines that are delivered in paper form everything gets delivered in an electronic form 10 years yeah if its 14 or if its 8 its immaterial to my fundamental point if we want tv to be more interactive youll deliver it over an ip network i mean its sort of funny today my son will stay up all night basically playing xbox live with friends that are in various parts of the world and yet i cant sit there in front of the tv and have the same kind of a social interaction around my favorite basketball game or golf match its just because one of these things is delivered over an ip network and the other is not

576709 when you get in youre dead tired you cant stand up
576710 then you start having three four drinks so it doesnt take much
576711 not that students dont know how to have fun no matter what their academic standing
576712 but weve definitely gotten away from that college party school mantra
576713 there is a lot of really good opportunity in virginia
576714 floridas leading the nation in job loss we have record foreclosures and where is charlie crist
576715 i think we should be in a post racial environment

576723 if you or i had any intention of defrauding the government of a couple of million dollars wed be thrown in jail
576724 why arent the executives facing such charges for having defrauded the government of billions of dollars
576725 the first thing i would do would be to re work all our trade policies and make them fair to the american worker and their families
576726 i have been observing the federal government from the outside watching the breathtaking incompetence and indifference in our political leadership
576727 the ad is a bit ironic given that mccain has been the most pop culture savvy republican candidate in quite some time
576728 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
576729 its still on its side in the ditch it has to be 100 percent stable for movement its not a quick process we have to make sure everything is stable first
576730 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
576731 will the film series evermore known as indy lite hold up when compared directly to a revived indiana jones
576732 next time i say weve been in tougher spots than this i mean this
576733 i know where you live and i went to school with your daughters
576734 basically people that are finding the market common are finding us so its definitely been good for us
576735 periodically we get a lot of hard rock parks employees and periodically bands
576736 once the families get done at the hard rock park theyre not staying in this area
576737 its hard to get them to actually open up wallets
576738 both projects have drawn some very favorable media attention to the area in large part because they did not mimic what the region already had to offer
576739 in the case of hard rock park i expect that will amount to several million dollars worth of free publicity
576740 thatll probably at least double the traffic on the road in front of me
576741 the market common was just a tremendous asset in order to get that deal done once we open up early next year i think our residents will probably be up there all the time
576742 i think we have to look at things longer term than just the next year or two with the quality of the development outside of this blip i think the prospects are very strong
576743 were seeing people cutting their vacations from seven days to five days to three days spending less money
576744 this year will be relatively flat across the board because of gas prices and the economy
576745 this was a tough year for the hard rock park to open up unfortunately poor timing
576746 we wish them well and we hope they do hit their projections but boy oh boy
576747 what we always said was that the park could hold up to 30 000 people a day
576748 were not allowed to give projections we didnt say that the park will do 30 000 per day
576749 once completed during peak season the park will entertain more than 30 000 guests per day
576750 its not usually that crowded the most weve had to wait is about 15 minutes and i kind of like it that way
576751 im sure they would like it to be more but were never bogged down with a bunch of lines
576752 i dont know what else youd find in myrtle beach that would cost you 50
576753 a lot of those people who come to myrtle beach they come with their families theyre looking for a bargain wherever they can get it
576754 they still want to be entertained they still want to do things and especially now knowing that the options are more expensive options when they want to do something theyre going to go to family kingdom theyre going to go to wild water amp wheels where you can have a great time and spend less than half you would at hard rock park
576755 i was going to find a way to make it happen
576756 people its really funny they cant make their car payments but theyll go to the baseball game they have to have their entertainment
576757 its almost akin to if you will what retailers do at thanksgiving to christmas if the thanksgiving sale doesnt get off to a booming start
576758 they need to figure out exactly how to market themselves where to do that and to what groups of people
576759 once they get all of that stuff squared away i think they can do very well in this area by and large theyve got a nice product out there
576760 you cant spend 400 million on a park and not have a very aggressive marketing strategy you cant do it
576761 were learning how to tell the public what we are
576762 christina applegate was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer
576763 benefiting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening
576764 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery no further statement will be issued at this time
576765 in the event that apple changes any part of the service or discontinues the service which apple may do at its election you acknowledge that you may no longer be able to use products to the same extent and that apple shall have no liability to you
576766 tennant says he doesnt want to sound unsympathetic but reminds digital music buyers that cd owners dont demand a refund from stores when they lose their discs as for backing up songs to a cd people should just accept the loss of quality because the only other alternative is to lose the music entirely he said
576767 its been a tough week as far as dealing with the pain
576768 im kind of excited just to get that taken care of after meeting with the doctor and everything i feel really confident that i should have a 100 percent recovery
576769 it had been bothering me and then it just got real bad to the point where it was intolerable
576770 i dont think any doubt that in 06 and 07 hes a healthy winning productive player
576771 its reasonable to say that between the hernia and this its amazing hes been able to do anything his toughness is off the chart
576772 if youre working for the short term you go sign somebody in november and thats what you sell from november till april 1
576773 if that is part of a more viable longer term plan then it makes sense but if its only short term to try to motivate people to buy season tickets for one more year thats probably not something that were interested in doing
576774 if we move the fences in is that sort of a backhanded excuse for the fact that we didnt do such and such offensively this year the fences dont have anything to do with a 235 batting average
576775 on the other hand if we brought the fences in would it be more or less entertaining at petco thats what i care about is there a comparative advantage or disadvantage competitively both of those things are a consideration weve tinkered once were not going to blow up petco weve got some constraints weve got concrete walls there are some things were not going to do
576776 what we have to establish in the minds of people is that look this is a good organization weve got a good plan and ive got confidence in them for the long haul
576777 any time you have a year like this that confidence takes a hit
576778 you have a lot more young guys at this point in the season than weve ever had since weve moved into the new ballpark
576779 i would expect them to get two or three veteran guys they dont have to be huge pieces just veteran guys and veteran presence to take some of the edge off of younger players help alleviate those growing pains

576781 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
576782 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
576783 this is a good recipe for leftover turkey and ham
576784 pick up those peaches cook them and make fruit pies
576785 its tree ripened peaches boiled down to taste then fried in peanut oil

576789 some farmers make the mistake of just paying family members a salary
576790 customers know what to expect its a small town mom and pop business that jack and diane started themselves they put blood sweat and tears into making it a success
576791 i understand why theyre called the worlds best fried pies
576792 other pies cant compare with the flaky crust and just right filling
576793 i loved being in news it made me a better journalist but ive always had a passion for sports
576794 its our way of saying thank you to the community for supporting the college
576795 every year they get another piece of yard work done theyve moved rocks cleaned flower beds moved lumber raked leaves
576796 id like to make a gradual incline here its too steep to mow
576797 its fun and its good to give back to the community
576798 they brought rakes and theyre using a snow shovel to scoop leaves theyre really helping people
576799 ive already thought of what i want them to do next year if were still around
576800 this is something so simple to us but it helps them a lot
576801 i think we forget in a college town that there is a community outside us this is a good way to help
576802 we just threw out there the concept of a one day service day we thought volunteer service was a noble effort and this was a way where students could connect with the community
576803 we started calling it the big event because we didnt know what else to call it
576804 we started out that first year with the same motivation as students have today but goodness gracious its grown
576805 its so gratifying to see how the big event has become an institution at texas a amp m its of incredible importance
576806 the students put shelving together and i needed a door for my gluten free room to seal it off and they did that
576807 they were fun to have around and we got a lot done

576816 we will make sure that kingsnorth power station has the very best available technologies in place so that we can make sure that we can produce power for one and a half million homes in the cleanest and most efficient way possible
576817 we will also make sure that it is carbon capture ready so we can add the technology as soon as it is ready both on a technical and commercial level
576818 in the face of all that we know about climate change its just absolute madness that we go down the path of burning more coal which is the dirtiest most inefficient fossil fuel there is
576819 we still believe that the overwhelming majority of people who are coming along to protest are lawful individuals
576820 what i will say to anybody who is thinking of breaking the law is that we have the capability of doing something about it

576834 it is the serbs and the orthodox who are not respected thanks to milosevic and his apartheid and ethnic cleansing regime
576835 giving us maps of iliria which included kosovo half of macedonia a good portion of montenegro and of course albania
576836 yugoslav tanks and troops took up positions today in a province in the south to put down anti government riots by albanian separatists the separatists want to unite with albania the small and selfisolated communist country on the adriatic
576837 the nationalists have a two point platform first to establish what they call an ethnically clean albanian republic and then the merger with albania to form a greater albania
576838 there is no religious state or religious majority the local troubles are ethnic not religious catholics are very deeply respected
576839 the end of the national question in kosovo is the beginning of the religious one as new challenges to the social and clerical order arise from radical islam
576840 catholic albanians and evangelical groups have faced continued intimidation and harassment
576841 a common feature of many attacks was the underlying intention to force minorities to leave and or to ensure their silence through fear this strategy was effective
576842 such suspicion was fuelled by the fact that catholic albanian villages suffered relatively little damage during the conflict
576843 i felt ashamed after what happened in 2004 we were under some pressure as well
576844 because he was so excited about his new dog a rottweiler like so many in america have when the kla came in with nato he was killed just for not being a good albanian
576845 especially the atheist groups are gradually getting inclined towards islam because of extensive propaganda and activities of the islamist ngos
576846 kosovo has finally declared its independence after a long and determined struggle by its people as we rejoice in this happy result we declare our solidarity with and support to our brothers and sisters there
576847 the islamic umma nation wishes them success in the new battle awaiting them which is the building of a strong and prosperous state capable of satisfying its people there is no doubt that the independence of kosovo will be an asset to the muslim world and further enhance joint islamic action
576848 happily claiming that a vastly majority muslim state has been carved out of serbia a european christian country

576870 the all blacks built pressure and didnt allow us to build any pressure the all blacks were very good on the tackle line and as a consequence we werent able to get into the game
576871 they profited from some of that pressure they built and it was one of those days when you get a sense nothing is going to work
576872 it is not one we look back on and reflect on with a lot of pride
576873 it reflected the way the game went the all blacks grew an arm and a leg and were prepared to have a crack
576874 i thought they the wallabies played bloody well last week and we played well this week thats about it
576875 the next contest is going to be massive both teams will have equal edge we had the edge today every dog has his day and it happened to be our day today
576876 they the wallabies never got any front foot ball some of the tackles put in really knocked them off their feet
576877 it comes down to a simple choice for all of us if you like the direction the country is going you should vote for mccain
576878 but if you want a candidate who rejects those policies but has a vision then obamas your guy
576879 ultimately i felt inspired by him and i dont think anyone in our generation has had that experience
576880 im not out here trying to change anybody but i feel he will do a better job leading the country and changing the course were on which has been disastrous
576881 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about
576882 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
576883 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities

576891 we tout ourselves as dinner theater with a dance floor
576892 adelaida should begin preparing supper but instead she lingers at her kitchen window watching vultures she thinks they are terrifying beautiful their sinewy wings forming silhouettes against a rust colored sky but it isnt simply their form she admires it is also the way they pick bones clean their nourishment means anothers death thoughts of death startle her and she thinks of rafa somewhere below the hovering scavengers rafa is ending his shift in the zona 4 rafa dear rafa how could a garbage collector get into so much trouble it all started with the sindicato and the man with burnt skin
576893 going out with chris was never knowing when he might disappear for days on end when he might beg her to sit up all night stuffing envelopes or when he might rap on her window with bleeding knuckles and a black eye she thought he was crazy but she loved him for his ideals for his compassion for the way he could light up a room full of people and the way he yelped for joy when he made love to her she had no particular vision of their future together but she couldnt imagine being without him or finding any other man as electrifying falling pregnant at the beginning of her final year had never been any part of her plan
576894 ive needed some time to appreciate the way our characters complement each other since i never intended to stay with barry much longer than the birth of our child
576895 i decided to postpone leaving him since then its been two years
576896 this morning my husband went on the internet and printed out detailed plans for building a tree house
576897 new womans ten year old granddaughter carrie ventures towards us from the other room she raises her glass of red kool aid heres to jesus christmas is for christ and we should all be grateful well what kind of toast is that lighten up already says father with a mellifluous smile he cranks anne murray rises from his chair and says to me how bout a dance

576900 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about
576901 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
576902 it will be hard it will tough we know the degree of entrenched disadvantage which exists in so many of these communities indigenous
576903 vamos expulsar todas as pessoas do sul que permane am na rea tur stica do monte kumgang e que consideremos desnecess rias
576904 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
576905 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
576906 quero destacar a firme convic o de quem fala ela e do presidente lula de que a integra o importante na vis o dos dois pa ses
576907 o assunto em doha era o que colocavam os pa ses desenvolvidos nessa negocia o e o que os pa ses emergentes colocavam mas n o era um bom neg cio para os pa ses emergentes e especificamente para a rep blica argentina com um desenvolvimento industrial inferior diferente do que tem o brasil
576908 hoje por suas pol ticas constantes o brasil tem uma empresa como a embraer e n s n o temos nada por isso temos que aplicar medidas que sejam permanentes no tempo
576909 a import ncia da argentina como um pa s altamente competitivo
576910 recentemente o presidente da fiesp federa o das ind strias do estado de s o paulo paulo skaf disse numa entrevista a um jornal argentino que a argentina hoje muito mais competitiva que o brasil na hora de se investir

576915 were the ioc we can bring human rights improvements and unrestricted internet to china
576916 this indicates a significant rise in the level of violence and the type of and frequency of actions theyre willing to take
576917 to us its pretty unconscionable that anyone would see this as a reasonable tactic to get your message out
576918 intends to negotiate in good faith to achieve timely and fair contracts for verizon union represented employees our expectation is to negotiate new contracts that will continue to provide leading wage and benefit packages
576919 we try to be reasonable with our costs we have kids meals and snack bar food which is affordable as well as specials throughout the summer
576920 our family sunday special for 11 per person for four or more is really popular
576921 anyone that wants to save some money should buy their tickets online before they come not only are the tickets cheaper but you dont have to stand in a long line at the ticket window
576922 a four pack of tickets online is only 99 95

576924 parents and grandparents that do not ride rides dont have to pay for admission like at other parks

576931 in the sessions we have taught school teachers and principals about various security aspects which are to be implemented immediately and also the idea is to make them aware on any kind of terrorist activities and possible threats
576932 we are implementing the advisory issued by the police commissionerate and tightening security in and around schools in the wake of the ahmedabad serial blasts and bombs recovered from surat city
576933 the way security systems have been placed in schools like ours those should be implemented in schools all across to ensure that we dont lose lives in the hands of terrorists and we can fight their challenges
576934 i was also attacked once it couldnt take me but my daughter was taken
576935 leopards could be captured and released but where do you release there are no forests left or habitat for leopards and the animal is highly adaptable more closely they stay to human habitation they can get easy prey
576936 if youve been to the decordova during the day you must come during the evening
576937 it becomes an even more magical place in the evening
576938 visitors can follow paths around the grounds our slopes are pretty gentle id suggest people wear flat shoes
576939 scada systems are vulnerable to emp insult the large numbers and widespread reliance on such systems by all of the nations critical infrastructures represent a systemic threat to their continued operation following an emp event additionally the necessity to reboot repair or replace large numbers of geographically widely dispersed systems will considerably impede the nations recovery from such an assault
576940 should the electrical power system be lost for any substantial period of time the commission believes that the consequences are likely to be catastrophic to civilian society machines will stop transportation and communication will be severely restricted heating cooling and lighting will cease food and water supplies will be interrupted and many people may die
576941 automobiles were subjected to emp environments under both engine turned off and engine turned on conditions no effects were subsequently observed in those automobiles that were not turned on during emp exposure the most serious effect observed on running automobiles was that the motors in three cars stopped at field strengths of approximately 30 kv m or above in an actual emp exposure these vehicles would glide to a stop and require the driver to restart them electronics in the dashboard of one automobile were damaged and required repair other effects were relatively minor twenty five automobiles exhibited malfunctions that could be considered only a nuisance e g blinking dashboard lights and did not require driver intervention to correct eight of the 37 cars tested did not exhibit any anomalous response
576942 wir wissen heute alles ber das higgs teilchen nur nicht ob es berhaupt existiert
576943 es bleibt uns nichts anders brig als einfach auf das unerwartete zu warten
576944 wir sind guter hoffnung dass wir diese methode der kriminologie noch verbessern k nnen
576945 die meisten morde passieren in wohnungsn he des t ters aber nicht in einem areal direkt um die wohnung herum wo die taten selten begangen werden weil die gefahr der entdeckung durch bekannte und nachbarn besonders gro ist
576946 hummeln haben ein simples gehirn und wie sie auf blumen reagieren ist leichter zu verstehen als die komplexen gedanken eines kriminellen
576947 this is their financial system they had demanded paper money federally insured bank deposits and a heavy governmental hand in the distribution of credit and now they have them the populist party might have lost the elections in the hard times of the 1890s but it won the future they got their government controlled money the federal reserve opened for business in 1914 and their government directed credit fannie mae and freddie mac in 1971 they got their pure paper dollar so today the fed can print all the dollars it deems expedient and the unwell federal mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac combine to dominate the business of mortgage origination
576948 we say in our platform that we believe that the right to coin money and issue money is a function of government those who are opposed to this proposition tell us that the issue of paper money is a function of the bank and that the government ought to go out of the banking business i stand with jefferson and tell them as he did that the issue of money is a function of the government and that the banks should go out of the governing business w hen we have restored the money of the constitution all other necessary reforms will be possible and until that is done there is no reform that can be accomplished
576949 the right of the government to issue money is not surrendered to the banks the control over the money so issued is not relinquished by the government
576950 the federal reserve board can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation and in either case it will possess inside information as to financial conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change either up or down
576951 this is the strangest most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any government that ever existed
576952 some people think that the federal reserve banks are united states government institutions
576953 these twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully and disloyally foisted upon this country by the bankers who came here from europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our american institutions
576954 the number of advances wasnt increasing exponentially i hadnt seen as many as i had expected not in any particular area just generally
576955 that the average individual innovator is having a smaller and smaller impact
576956 i am in two minds about this biologists have abandoned the idea of progress we just are where we are but humanity is so far in advance of anything that has gone before that it seems to be a qualitative leap
576957 and i increasingly am persuaded that it is then we will have the technology to deal with it
576958 torture is a matter that has always been unacceptable beyond discussion lets not pretend those days are passed we now have ticking bomb terrorists and its an empirical fact that every civilised democracy would use torture in those circumstances
576959 terrorism is a major step backwards in civilisation hitler was a major step backwards sometimes we have to step backwards too to combat such things but progress happens in other areas a generation now growing up may have to accept more security measures and less privacy but in other areas like sexual conduct we are making progress i dont think overall we are making a step back
576960 the implications are mind blowing civilisation faces the sharpest and perhaps most violent dislocation in recent history
576961 market based panic will within a few days drive prices skyward
576962 and the market will become paralysed at prices too high for the wheels of commerce and daily living
576963 when i first concluded that our greatest scientific achievements will soon be forgotten and our most cherished monuments will crumble to dust
576964 the following thought experiment frames the problem before us and the essential needs a planetary system of living economies must address
576965 one morning all six billion wake up with a new awareness their planet is actually a living space ship with a biologically based life support system so overstressed that it is on the verge of collapse
576966 a few decide to arm themselves kill off as many of their rivals as possible and attempt to secure what they can for themselves
576967 there is desperate need for a solution that works for all
576968 the essentials come quickly to mind there must be an immediate reordering of priorities the use of every resource must be optimized to assure the health and physical security of every person with minimal waste the life support system must be restored to full function as quickly as possible everything must be recycled with no release of toxics into the environment there will be no luxuries for the few until the basic needs of all are adequately met
576969 the stone age didnt end because of a shortage of stones
576970 all of a sudden it isnt morning in america its dusk on planet earth
576971 things are getting better and better and worse and worse faster and faster
576972 courage is not the absence of fear but rather the judgment that something else is more important than ones fear the timid presume that it is the lack of fear that allows the brave to act when the timid do not but to take action when one is not afraid is easy to refrain when afraid is also easy to take action regardless of fear is brave
576973 when i was young and free and my imagination had no limits i dreamed of changing the world as i grew older and wiser i discovered the world would not change so i shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country
576974 as i grew into my twilight years in one last desperate attempt i settled for changing only my family those closest to me but alas they would have none of it
576975 and now as i lie on my deathbed i suddenly realize if i had only changed myself first then by example i would have changed my family
576976 from their inspiration and encouragement i would then have been able to better my country and who knows i may have even changed the world
576977 i hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph
576978 if i knew you were coming id have baked a cake just got some shoe polish painted my face
576979 wat do u think abt ur result wat do u think abt ur performance
576980 are you telling me that if i dont come and see you every day i am not being a good daughter
576981 i have the feeling that you are upset because is that right
576982 i understand that you feel differently but let me explain why we chose to do this and so
576983 im sorry you feel that way i hope it wont be a big problem between us
576984 like i said before bob and i decided that this year we would
576985 are you saying that i am not being responsible when
576986 there is no point in trying to talk to you
576987 i think i would like more children i wouldnt want to adopt though i think i have two years left to have a child naturally if i want to
576988 with washington state with cal state fullerton texas a amp m and xavier we have four basketball teams in the non conference schedule that obviously went deep into the ncaa tournament
576989 we have a trip to utah that year in and year out is one of premier programs in the mountain west conference
576990 for our basketball team with the philosophy change this season and the numerous injuries to key players like garrett temple one of the things for me as a new coach is that i didnt over schedule
576991 my philosophy as it regards to scheduling is that the most important game is going to be the first game we play against jackson state for us to compete at a high level every opponent on our schedule regardless of who we play when we play or where we play it is important we compete at a high level and look at every opponent the same way
576992 the system does bring extra responsibilities with it but fulfilling those extra responsibilities is well rewarded
576993 but tb started to become an issue in herefordshire so now we breed the replacements here
576994 we wean the calves here and then at between seven and 12 weeks they are sent up to herefordshire
576995 until recently we were in a bluetongue protection zone and the herefordshire farm was in a surveillance zone it meant we had to keep them a little longer than we would normally do
576996 adopting the same finishing system for all the calves is the most efficient way of doing things
576997 we use as much home grown grass and maize forage as possible
576998 ive sold stock elsewhere in the past and had no feedback once they have left the farm with waitrose you get a feeling that they are really involved and want to improve stock for the mutual benefit of them and us
576999 when the market was poor we were paid a higher price
577000 this loyalty means we are very willing to work with waitrose to deliver the quality beef its customers demand
577001 we are looking to develop these relationships because we see the pressure on the supply of quality cattle increasing
577002 cap reform is really starting to bite and there are signs of a decline in the suckler herd

577004 it appeared that he had fallen or slipped and the gun discharged
577005 im not sure what he was planning to do either relocate the turtle or dispatch it

577007 a wonderful guy a very well respected and well liked police officer if we ever needed a canine even though he was with bensalem he would always come out and try to help us
577008 were all heartbroken for his family he had his retirement to look forward to and had a beautiful piece of property that he loved
577009 really its the kind of thing you expect kids to do its very unusual to see adults behaving in as ridiculous a manner

577037 amongst various other loyalist members of the homosexual ring were john mckeague who ran the loyalist paramilitary organisation the red hand commandos which was involved in many sectarian killings

577049 after having spent six months in solitary confinement in a cell with unbrakeable glass feeling extremely vulnerable without clothes knowing that anyone could look through the magnified peephole on the door at any time and they did too
577050 there was no recreation during that time in the cell i was locked up 24 hours a day for the whole of the six months yet i wasnt a criminal i just didnt get on with my parents so i took them to court for mental and physical cruelty
577051 of course they won cos they could afford a solicitor i couldnt and i would proven uncontrollable and given the choice of going to live with one of my sisters who were married or to go in the home i didnt think it fair on my sisters cos they all had young families so i chose the home
577052 the six months in solitary was my introduction to haut de la garenne the only contact i had with the outside world in that time was with a member of staff who insisted in supervising my showers and bathroom visits

577063 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight

577071 the next question seems to be can a municipality buy land fair market value from itself with cpa funds
577072 ahhh you are a crafty one the hypo here would be a case where the tm uses unrestricted funds to buy non cpa eligible property swaps it with the private owner for cpa eligible property and then is reimbursed with cpa funds for the original purchase price basically selling this parcel to the cpa on its face it seems like a transparent circumvention of the prohibition stated by josh above but im still curious to hear the authoritative answer to the question can the town buy land from itself
577073 its important for the lender to understand what the issues are and try and determine solutions that make sense banks dont want real estate
577074 if a borrower realizes there is some change in their financial situation the first thing to do is go talk to the lender
577075 the sooner a lender can be involved the more options we have to work with the borrower
577076 we have more flexibility than if they are 60 90 days behind
577077 in the past two months ive spoken to about 20 people but a lot of them waited too late to call
577078 most were dealing with the adjustable rate mortgages where they just cant pay the mortgage

577116 by my 50th birthday my mother my sister my best friend of 40 years my father and my ex husband were missed and missing from my life the last 37 days for each person was as different as their personalities they taught me things that continue to resonate through my life however my mothers death was the one that would help me to decide how to spend my last 37 days or whatever multiple of that number that my days may hold she died 24 years ago at age 57 of ovarian cancer but my decision was made just last year she died in october before her retirement in june she planned to travel and build a home on some property that desire lines led her to buy some years earlier the travel she dreamed of ended up being to chemotherapy sessions and the property without a house was recently sold she grew up with sarcasm and indifference but treated her own children with the love and respect that i believe she had longed for as a child when informed that i was to become a grandmother i was elated twenty seven years in education had me dreaming of endless summers instead of the dreaded return to work in september i dreamed of meeting friends for coffee long indulgent walks and reading terrific blogs to my hearts content mostly though i longed to somehow get back a little of the time that cancer had stolen from mom i wanted a small victory for us both if you will i retired at 57 the same age as my mother when she died i am leahs grandmother and am following moms example about how to respect a child and love them enormously without ever suffocating them i dont know if my 37 days have started but i do know that i have had more than 37 days of joy and time with friends and family since i left work i love that my verbs have changed i used to meet talk budget order catalog and straighten now i walk explore giggle nurture and dance silly dances three days a week with a sweet short person bliss pure bliss
577117 we can adopt our own indigenous solutions which are less expensive and are 100 sure of preventing the spread of this deadly disease i find it very baffling how we could throw away what worked and embrace ideas from elsewhere then we watched as rates of infection soared again to claim lives
577118 for every african who gains access to hiv treatment six become newly infected
577119 to treat one aids patient with life prolonging anti retroviral drugs costs more than 1 000 a year our successful abc campaign cost just 29 cents per person each year
577120 viciously homophobic countries like jamaica pakistan saudi arabia uganda iraq and nigeria
577121 tyrannies should not be rewarded no us aid for anti gay regimes
577122 debates in and among those who want to be biblical
577123 even the anglican mainstream website wants to claim that the abolitionists were really biblical
577124 we havent talked about the gospel we havent talked about salvation
577125 the toothpaste has been squeezed out of the tube and we are not able to put it back again
577126 ik werkte in andel bij de wilheminasluis de sluismeester kwam uit wemeldinge en n van de sluismeesters die naar het volkerak verhuisde kwam ook uit wemeldinge toen is dat balletje gaan rollen en werd me gevraagd is dat niets voor jou ik heb gesolliciteerd maar dat was meer voor de vorm
577127 de havenmeester van het wilhelminakanaal waar ik bij de sluis werkte kende mensen van rijkswaterstaat die naar het volkerak gingen ik kreeg ook de vraag niets voor jou
577128 we waren hier nog nooit geweest veel tijd om na te denken hadden we niet want mijn vrouw was in verwachting en in september uitgerekend
577129 ik had nog nooit van helwijk gehoord toen mijn vader hoorde dat ik hier ging werken bleek hij de omgeving uitstekend te kennen in 1939 was hij hier gemobiliseerd hij herkende veel
577130 o nee er was een lagere school een kleuterschooltje dat ook dienst deed als consultatiebureau jonge moeders hoefden helwijk niet eens uit later kwam er ook een winkeltje dat is inmiddels weer verdwenen
577131 het was niet echt een openbare telefoon maar je kon er altijd terecht ging de teller op nul en na het bellen kon je afrekenen
577132 het wijkje waar we nu nog wonen is altijd gezellig geweest de saamhorigheid onder de rijkswaterstaters was groot bij mooi weer was het buurten en je kon altijd op elkaar rekenen
577133 ik weet het nog goed om 09 00 uur ik stond op noord west de waterpolitie lag in het hellegat om de schepen tegen te houden het hellegat was toen nog open en de schippers hadden geen zin om voor de sluis te wachten s nachts probeerden ze zonder licht door het hellegat te varen
577134 op het wilhelminakanaal waar ik werkte kwamen per dag hooguit 35 schepen langs om geschut te worden dan hadden we al een drukke dag bij het volkerak hadden we er regelmatig 750 liggen twintig schepen voor iedere schut was geen uitzondering nu liggen er hooguit twee drie grote schepen in de sluis
577135 kinderen en een vrouw zien verdrinken vergeet je nooit meer drie ehboers die op de sluis werkten hebben eens een schipper gered kregen ze van de toenmalige burgemeester reinders een oorkonde
577136 vanaf het begin werd voor het sluispersoneel een groot sinterklaasfeest gehouden werd er op 5 december een sluis dichtgegooid de deur ging alleen open voor het schip waarop sinterklaas stond als het schip de sluis binnen was ging de deur weer dicht wijlen jan van antwerpen van de sigarenwinkel uit willemstad was jarenlang sinterklaas hij ging ook alle boten langs die voor de sluis lagen leuk voor de schipperskinderen die toen nog gewoon aan boord waren
577137 daar was toch ook aan gedacht het was hard werken absoluut niet altijd even gemakkelijk en vergeet de vrouwen niet die zaten vaak alleen thuis maar het was ook een mooie tijd als je in die begintijd bij de sluis kwam werken had je meteen een woning toch niet zo slecht helwijk is inderdaad klein gebleven en niet uitgegroeid tot het stadje dat planologen voor ogen hadden absoluut niet erg zo is het goed
577138 when a man begins to understand himself he begins to live
577139 if you were to play russian roulette it would land on the chamber with a bullet but missfire and blow your hand off

577142 well i could have made it to the yard if you hadnt pulled me over but i just ran out of my 14 and i hadnt touched my logbook since 1030 that morning
577143 hey wanna come over to the truckstop and pick me up and bring me back at 6 in the morning he said sure
577144 la confianza humana es hermosa pero muy sensible a la derrota
577145 there are things the active duty army doesnt want to do and im very offended by it
577146 using the national guard brigades in ad hoc organizations structured specifically for the mission is seen by our soldiers as making them fillers rather than trained cohesive units
577147 it sends the signal to them that they are second rate soldiers and units
577148 ideally the brigade will have the opportunity to shape that
577149 its not the ideal mission its not what the brigade has trained to do but the brigade is the best thing the army has
577150 its going to be much harder on the young guys who have no idea what theyll be going into
577151 theyre not going to be doing anything they were trained to do
577152 we will see a continued rising number of marriage and family casualties of the war
577153 i think everybody is worried about the continual deployment of the guard
577154 i think sometimes were asking too much of these kids and their families
577155 i love latitude its in the stars but longitude its about time time and clocks and all the rest of that have always been a fascination for me
577156 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet

577167 every child can learn notalways the same way or on the same day
577168 five years from today youre going to be the same person making the same money except for the books you read and the people you meet
577169 key positions you have embraced that we believe are essential to sustaining this movement
577170 no sensible person ought to call evolutionary biology darwinism and no sensible person does
577171 he fell about as far as you can and he wants to prove to the world that hes not only innocent but that hes back
577172 he was the smartest banker i ever knew he could make companies golden
577173 but he controlled all aspects of the equity issuance business and this is where he ran into trouble
577174 e mail is the first place prosecutors look to try and discover what somebodys intent was
577175 its been a gold mine for prosecutors for a decade
577176 quattrone created and oversaw at csfb an anomalous reporting and supervisory structure in which traditional lines of demarcation among the various functions of a securities firm were obliterated
577177 he beat the legal rap but on wall street all you really have is your reputation and he took a hit to his
577178 hes going to have to dig himself out of that and maybe he will and maybe he wont
577179 as you might imagine right now things are a bit hectic with all the things a startup has to get done
577180 its about proving that our way of doing things is best
577181 i dont think you can blame one person for the bubble
577182 but the excesses might not have been as extreme were it not for frank quattrone
577183 before he had a well oiled machine with a bulge bracket behind him
577184 now people can say no to him its going to be very difficult for frank to reclaim his past glory
577185 in certain instances csfbs marketing or pitch materials implicitly promised that a company would receive favorable research if it agreed to use csfb for its investment banking business
577186 the industry should petition to remove the spitzer initiatives because ultimately they hurt the competitiveness of our country by denying small companies access to research analysts
577187 all he did was to take two research analysts who might have told untruths and turn it into an industrywide witch hunt which basically shut down sell side research for companies like many in this audience that are trying to change the world
577188 hes one of the guys who built this valley and he won a lot of friends

577190 klub sepak bola adalah pengalaman traumatik bagiku hey kamu kulit coklat hey orang kulit coklat bodoh dan miskin pribumi inlander petani hey kamu lupa pakai sepatu meski anak bule yang masih kecil pun sudah tahu meludahi kami inilah hal pertama yang diajarkan oleh orang tua mereka setelah tidak lagi memakai popok
577191 tempe itu sejenis makanan yang murah yang dibuat dari kedelai yang dijamurkan negara dengan mental tempe berarti negara yang lemah lembek itulah yang sedang kami alami sekarang orang orang belanda selalu dan terus menerus mengatakan ataupun menganggap kami sebagai bangsa dengan otak kapuk oleh karena itu kami menjadi pengecut dan tidak percaya diri takut untuk duduk takut untuk berdiri sebab apapun yang kami lakukan selalu dianggap salah kami menjadi orang orang yang mempunyai hati yang kerdil dan gampang di konstruksikan diombang ambingkan
577192 penanaman terus menerus pemerintah hindia belanda kepada kami bahwa kami inferior berhasil meyakinkan kami akan hal itu senjata yang mereka pakai adalah dengan meyakinkan kami bahwa kami bodoh dan menananamkan bahwa ras kami adalah ras yang rendah dan hina itulah senjata yang dipakai oleh penjajah

577194 im not the man they think i am at home oh no no no im a rocket man rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone
577195 i just think you find yourself in a lot of weird situations
577196 when you know a friend is there you do not go to see him then hes gone and you blast your conscience to shreds that you did not see him
577197 the hebrew word timshel thou mayest that gives a choice it might be the most important word in the world that says the way is open that throws it right back on a man for if thou mayest it is also true that thou mayest not thou mayest makes a man great that gives him stature with the gods for in his weakness and his filth he has still the great choice he can choose his course and fight it through and win
577198 yes memory without that time would be unarmed against us
577199 kata orang agama akan menjaga kita dari perbuatan dosa namun berapa banyak dosa yang telah diperbuat atas nama agama agama dimaksudkan sebagai rahmat bagi semua umat manusia untuk menjadi tali penghubung antara semua ciptaannya kita semua bersaudara bukan karena satu keturunan tapi karena satu tuhan yang berkuasa di atas sana oh tuhan kadang aku berpikir bahwa agama lebih baik tidak ada saja karena justru agamalah penyebab perselisihan perpecahan dan pertumpahan darah dan bukan menjadi tali pemersatu umat manusia aku sering bertanya pada diriku sendiri apakah agama merupakan sebuah rahmat kalau prakteknya malah seperti ini
577200 ada setan yang lebih jahat daripada minuman keras opium oh mengerikan keganasan opium sungguh tak bisa diuraikan dengan kata kata opium adalah sebuah penyakit di jawa ya opium lebih ganas dari pada penyakit itu sendiri penyakit pasti bisa sembuh namun opium kejahatan opium bisa menyebar dan melebar kemana mana dan tak pernah tak akan pernah bisa ditangani dengan satu peraturan pemerintah semakin banyak penggunanya semakin menjadi besarlah bisnis ini bisnis opium adalah bisnis yang paling menjanjikan bagi pemerintah belanda meraka untung tapi rakyat buntung apakah rakyat menjadi baik atau tidak mereka peduli apa banyak yang bilang opium itu tidak merugikan oh mungkin mereka buta tidak merugikan bagaimana pembunuhan pembakaran perampokan apalagi kalau bukan akibat langsung dari opium
577201 gamelan kaca yang ada di pendopo itu bisa bercerita padamu lebih banyak daripadaku mereka melantunkan lagu kesayangan kami hm bukan sebuah lagu bukan pula sebuah melodi hanya suara suara dan getaran getaran lembut berpadu dan mengalir begitu saja tapi disaat yang sama terdengar begitu menentramkan sukma mengalir begitu syahdunya bukan bukan itu itu bukan suara dari kaca tembaga atau kayu itu adalah suara jiwa jiwa manusia yang sedang berbicara kepada kami kadang gundah kadang meratap dan jarang sekali tertawa bahagia dan jiwaku terbang terbawa desiran suara suara itu suara gamelan kelangit biru melewati awan tipis menerpa sinar gemintang bunyi gong bergaung keras membawaku kelembah gulita kejurang yang dalam melewati belantara yang takterjamah manusia dan jiwaku gemetar ketakutan kesakitan dan perih
577202 dan masih juga sejumlah orang belanda mengumpati hindia sebagai ladang kera yang mengerikan aku naik pitam jika mendengar orang mengatakan hindia yang miskin orang mudah sekali lupa kalau negeri kera yang miskin ini telah mengisi penuh kantong kosong mereka dengan emas saat mereka pulang ke patria setelah beberapa lama saja tinggal disini
577203 shes a very tough opponent she proved that this week
577204 she beat some very good players but its another match i just want to focus on myself playing my game being aggressive and lets see whos going to be stronger sunday
577205 its still one match im so excited about this about my game and that im in the final of a tier i for the first time i will try to play my best sunday
577206 i feel like i belong in the top 20 and maybe i can still be better
577207 im really happy to be there because my goal for this year was to start in the top 50 and now i will get to the top 20 for me its like a dream
577208 shes playing like the number one player in the world
577209 if i would be like top five i would have maybe 200 points between us but its still a big difference in the points at the moment im not focusing on that because its still really far away if it will get closer then i might think about it
577210 it really helped me that it started raining because i was able to go in the locker room and talk to my coach
577211 it wasnt easy to talk to my coach because he was really mad then i realized that if i start to play my game to put more pressure on her to step in the court then i have a chance to play against her and to win this match
577212 do you think its fair to change a semifinal when you already played one set on it and it goes to another court
577213 exactly thats not fair we played on court 1 for me thats not fair
577214 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
577215 tim spent his life travelling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle and you could hear him laughing a mile away it didnt matter what kind of day you were having because when you heard his laugh you couldnt help but join in
577216 the outpouring of well wishes from complete strangers has been overwhelming
577217 we are suffering our loss this is obviously a most difficult time for us all
577218 eye has not seen nor ear heard nor have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for those who love him
577219 fathers do not exasperate your children that they may not lose heart
577220 the problem is not that pastors dont know about five fold ministry the problem is that many know but they dont care
577221 he will show you what to do and how and when to do it
577222 john you dont know the abuses ive taken you dont know the nights ive cried to god or the demanding prophetic people who have camped on my step or upset my church you dont know what it is like
577223 prophet is fun and games well it isnt that is one reason i am posting on this blog and building a forum for hidden prophets
577224 weve had some preliminary discussions with police about the concept
577225 victoria police is constantly considering options to combat public drunkenness and disorderly behaviour

577227 we will make sure that kingsnorth power station has the very best available technologies in place so that we can make sure that we can produce power for one and a half million homes in the cleanest and most efficient way possible
577228 we will also make sure that it is carbon capture ready so we can add the technology as soon as it is ready both on a technical and commercial level
577229 in the face of all that we know about climate change its just absolute madness that we go down the path of burning more coal which is the dirtiest most inefficient fossil fuel there is
577230 we still believe that the overwhelming majority of people who are coming along to protest are lawful individuals
577231 what i will say to anybody who is thinking of breaking the law is that we have the capability of doing something about it

577236 kalo bunda bilang dengan pengorbanan sekecil mungkin dan bisa menghasilkan sebesar mungkin kondisi keluarga kita tidak akan separah ini
577237 you pretend to be communicating when youre actually stifling communication
577238 a phone conversation is like wildfire you dont know where its going to go
577239 were slaves to our devices blackberries and phones reachable 24 7
577240 i dont want to get into hey whats going on how you doing
577241 i just get to the point like ill meet you at 3
577242 i just say i wont be coming in im under the weather by the time he hears voice mail its already noon
577243 in brightest day in blackest night no evil shall escape my sight let those who worship evils might beware my power green lanterns light
577244 we will make sure that kingsnorth power station has the very best available technologies in place so that we can make sure that we can produce power for one and a half million homes in the cleanest and most efficient way possible
577245 we will also make sure that it is carbon capture ready so we can add the technology as soon as it is ready both on a technical and commercial level
577246 in the face of all that we know about climate change its just absolute madness that we go down the path of burning more coal which is the dirtiest most inefficient fossil fuel there is
577247 we still believe that the overwhelming majority of people who are coming along to protest are lawful individuals
577248 what i will say to anybody who is thinking of breaking the law is that we have the capability of doing something about it
577249 is this what we want in our pristine valleys of clayoquot sound
577250 i would say no i would absolutely say no so i think we have to oppose all of these projects
577251 i never go to europe i never go to the queen and tell her how to be in her territory what gives the right of any other society to come here and say that to me and my chiefs
577252 give us a chance to do what we need to do on our own
577253 this is a clearcut like the old fashioned clearcuts that everybody knew would destroy watersheds would lead to erosion would lead to the siltation in our oceans in our rivers
577254 those precious places like clayoquot sound are getting fewer and fewer
577255 people say to me why would you trust first nations
577256 i think its a healthy thing to see environmental groups involved and speaking out and negotiating whether its with a first nations government a federal government a provincial government or even a government of another country
577257 we want a place where ideas are spoken about and we collectively try to get to a good place thats why the prospect of disagreeing with a first nations government doesnt concern me im not freaked out at all i think this is a healthy situation
577258 the allegiance of first nations and environmental organizations over the past 25 to 30 years has frankly been a bit of an uneasy one
577259 you know it hasnt always been one where there is an absolute congruent goal i think what that relationship has been historically based on is a common agenda of seeking environmental justice and social justice
577260 its probably up to academics to peel apart whether environmentalists have piggybacked on a set of communities that have had no power and now that they have power the worm has sort of turned
577261 there is something changing theres definitely a power shift thats occurred
577262 but i dont think thats the death knell for environmentalism and i dont think it means there arent agendas in common between environmentalists and first nations
577263 its this conflict between economic development that is sound and has a future and the short term destructive approach
577264 i honestly didnt support the science panel report because i read it as soon as it came out and i dont think the environmentalists read the whole thing there were holes in there big enough to drive 1 000 logging trucks through and were seeing the result of that now
577265 there is a split within the native communities everyone isnt on the same page
577266 it takes a lot in a native community for people to stand up and go against their leadership
577267 things are going to hell right now this biosphere thing is not working its been hijacked by development interests
577268 people have to look into their hearts to make it really work
577269 its not about political manoeuvring or ego or crusading its about making a connection with the land itself the way the old people did communicating with the land and creating a long term vision if it cant happen here its hard to say where or how it could ever happen
577270 there are seven different categories in which someone can be nominated
577271 if an individual fits the criteria they can certainly be considered
577272 there are many many individuals who have had a tremendous impact in elgin or in the world in these categories and we believe they should be recognized
577273 we will recognize them for now on a special web site page that will be created but eventually we would like to recognize them on a larger scale
577274 the investigation is still ongoing and it should reach a conclusion in the next couple of days
577275 genevas historic center is a source of pride to residents and an attractive walkable commercial district to visitors historic preservation has always played an important role in maintaining the citys authentic sense of place this discussion is critical in determining the future of historic preservation in geneva
577276 we wanted to get the national night out celebration back into the neighborhoods because we thought it was important for people to get out and get to know each other and the people on their blocks
577277 its important for us to know that individual neighbors can rely on each other
577278 most experts are in agreement that its inevitable that we will become totally infested over time
577279 when that will happen i cant say its pretty grim
577280 it got here by accident and its taking advantage of the food source here
577281 this isnt the first time this kind of thing happened
577282 these things happen and its not coincidental that theyre all invasive pests that cause these things
577283 ash is a very popular tree because it has a lot of qualities that make it a good tree for landscaping
577284 there is no saving the tree once you start seeing symptoms its kind of too late
577285 the point was that it is hard to get into our neighborhood
577286 if you are going north on state a visitor would guess that they could turn on west chicago but you cant so you continue on to west highland and then get stuck there waiting creating a backup of cars behind you
577287 there have been many complaints over the years they are just physically limited outdated intersections
577288 when it was originally put in service there were some problems
577289 it was raining at 3 a m that day but it a little after 8 a m it stopped
577290 they like this truck because theres a bed in it
577291 you see a lot of trucks on the road but not everyone has the chance for the hands on theres a lot of joy here you dont even hear any kids crying there are no frowns all smiles
577292 theres a pipe that runs along the ladder that can pump 2 000 gallons of water every minute
577293 it gives people a chance to see the rigs and it gives us a chance to be out in the community
577294 i dont want the state to take a role in telling us what to do
577295 my job in district 214 is try to do the best i can for this community
577296 the people here like what the schools provide and we cant endanger that
577297 if this is the land of opportunity then we as a state and as a society have an obligation to create those opportunities for everyone as best we can
577298 would a different kind of tax be as reliable i think its still pretty unclear
577299 but at the same time we never have enough i would like to see schools all over the state funded better but im not sure at this point how wed go about it
577300 i think there would be a way to make it work without hurting the kids out here in the suburbs but wed have to put aside politics to get there
577301 as a statewide system were only as strong as our weakest link
577302 if were failing to educate children somewhere whether its st charles or chicago or anywhere in the state and we have to remediate them down the line in the prison system or elsewhere thats not a good way of doing things
577303 sometimes sports on tv can feel exclusionary when you cant keep pace with the stats
577304 and as a viewer im like yeah but is she crying after winning the gold medal are her mom and dad there
577305 thats part of what i actually want to know when im sitting at home
577306 i come about this in the most round way possible
577307 i actually met my husband through work because he was a sportscaster and while he isnt doing that any longer he always has maintained an interest in sports the tv always is turned to sports so ive watched everything
577308 i also have two children who are really active in sports much more than i ever was so ive come to develop a genuine love of sports not as an athlete but as a viewer and part of the discussion i first had with cbc about this was i wanted to bring the perspective of a viewer to my role as a host of the games
577309 theres so much talk right now about china but the political component of the olympics obviously goes back decades and decades and probably will continue for years to come it has become part of the games that you need to go into these things with your eyes wide open and having a news background probably is something ill find myself relying on
577310 certainly there is an awareness here that we dont have the games for vancouver 2010 and london 2012
577311 but as opposed to lets go out with a whimper its more like lets go out with a bang
577312 what can i say just growin up in vancouver which is research in and of itself
577313 i thought that was a french inhale but apparently thats through the nose ive heard it called a ghost face lets just call it the rogen inhale from now on try it with your friends
577314 and we started talking ideas and he said im gonna do this movie knocked up with seth but after that you guys should do a movie together
577315 im like damn hes way more famous than me well ultimately have to do what he wants but we had a table read and he was just a thousand times funnier as saul
577316 i always thought he was really funny and was kinda shocked that after freaks and geeks he took that more serious turn career wise
577317 a loose notion of what about a weed action movie and me and evan thought that could be rad basically we started thinking we could make a weed movie and action movie with a friendship story to it and it would be our favourite movie ever
577318 we really wanted to key on the action part we were big fans of lethal weapon scripter shane blacks movies when we were young me and evan die hard and pulp fiction and reservoir dogs the kind of movies where comedy and violence worked together real well and it was a great time franco cracked his face open danny mcbride who plays the middleman to a drug kingpin cracked the back of his head open i punched amber heard who plays dales teenaged girlfriend in the face just to get her in the mood
577319 welcome to the set it was a lot of fun
577320 it was an unusual male female fight scene then we had a shot where we said lets just wrestle and see what happens and i kinda went for it i didnt think i bit it that hard but she said there were teeth marks and i think one of her cousins was after me
577321 honestly the more we got into it the more we got excited about blowing stuff up and having shootouts and that stuff costs money when youve got a car chase and they give you a day to do it and you say we need like a week and you compromise and do it in four it was all these negotiative financial things but the studio was really supportive of these guys and it was before superbad and knocked up had come out
577322 we actually showed them some scenes from pineapple so we could say look we can write action scenes
577323 i didnt like it franco didnt have a hard time with it but franco will smoke anything
577324 in high school i certainly smoked a fair amount of marijuana got in trouble for it
577325 the very first day of shooting we got in a little moped accident
577326 it was my fault even through blake was my backup person
577327 santorini is a very special island so beautiful and spectacular
577328 the minute i landed there i was like wow i cant believe people dont shoot here more often then as we started scouting i realized there were no cars and everything is steep we had to lug equipment up and down the steps sometimes bringing things on donkeys so it was very challenging to shoot
577329 i didnt like working with my father because it felt so strange
577330 i was yelling at him and ive never yelled at him you cant yell at him because hell just give you a teddy bear hug
577331 they had a man on set that was helping me with the language
577332 and i loved wearing that dress i loved saying the words and being in a different movie altogether within this movie
577333 it was a huge challenge youve got two women filming television and the gilmore girls was still shooting when we started the pre production
577334 as far as the question as whether or not we would have filmed without all four girls who knows we didnt have to do that so luckily we werent faced with that reality i believe we would not have made the movie without all four girls
577335 i guess by hollywood standards maybe one would say that the first film wasnt so successful
577336 it had the most fantastic following it had a life after the theatrical release it was a beautiful film that we were all extremely proud to have made but if you go by the actual business side of things i think nine times out of 10 there wouldnt have been a sequel but my fellow producers and ann really felt like these characters had to live on on the screen

577343 this event is important to target because of our long standing relationship with st jude childrens research hospital and the meaningful work they do

577345 target and variety continue the tradition of entertainers giving back to people in need the dedication and enthusiasm of young hollywood and partners like variety and target enables us to carry on my fathers vision that no child should die in the dawn of life
577346 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases
577347 with a modest financial investment we can improve survival very quickly
577348 that is because these countries have developed twinning programs with st jude and other institutions
577349 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
577350 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
577351 and that investment can come from outside sources as well

577361 spoke of the manner in which the work of the church was advancing in the colonies and dependencies of the british crown a matter in which he said he had much experience if the same had been done for america in days gone by it might have been a greater and a better country than it was now for a hundred years there existed in america an episcopal church without bishops and the church which had government protection was that which was left without any organisation in vain that church pleaded with the government of england for redress archbishops and bishops pressed the matter upon the attention of the crown and year after year the society for the propagation of the gospel made strenuous efforts to remedy the evils but while it was allowed to the roman catholic church to have what bishops she pleased in her discretion the sons and daughters of the church of england were left without the ministrations which were pledged to them at their baptism nothing so much us this strengthened the americans for their struggle against this country nothing induced them more than this to look with interest upon the struggle for independence and to delight in seeing the secular power scattered into fragments until at length it entirely disappeared

577372 it is not to barack obamas advantage to make this a big issue

577375 barack obama has played the race card from the bottom of the deck

577378 its simple these are three of the biggest celebrities in the world thats why they were chosen

577431 a lot of people said what you did was great
577432 i want to win the gold medal yes i want to win the gold medal thats my goal and im not doing this haphazardly im doing everything i can possibly do to be the best im not just satisfied making this team
577433 i want to do a lot of things that no one else has done
577434 people in the wrestling world dont really expect that much from him except himself his coaches and his family
577435 some people think its a fluke and a lot of people wish harry lester was on the team because they feel he had a better chance to medal than jake does
577436 but jake wants to prove to people that hes for real
577437 i was like no were going to make it doggone it
577438 i was thinking jake can play soccer but theres no wrestling
577439 you see the coach walk away and the kids just followed him they loved him
577440 i said i dont know who they are and i dont know where they are but we wanted that for jake
577441 jake is the only one in school history who has done that as an eighth grader
577442 my initial reason to go was to congratulate him but within the same sentence i said we need you to come back to anoka and help the community i got this kid i think hes a brandon paulson
577443 ive never had somebody go through my entire collection 15 to 20 years of video and he wanted more
577444 i never had a kid just want so much i told jake dont burn out but he had such a passion and love for wrestling
577445 he was really tough and abrasive and yelled at jake to do things
577446 he said if i work with jake and hes willing to listen hell never lose another match at the state tournament again
577447 you have to think theres probably no one else in the world doing this right now this is what it takes to be the best
577448 if anyone had a chance to beat harry lester it was one of the other veterans but an 18 year old kid coming out of high school
577449 were expecting him to medal because we believe hes good enough to do that
577450 as long as he keeps his head on straight and not get caught up in the atmosphere then hes going to turn some heads
577451 the u s created the deadlock on an issue which was not trade but related to livelihood of farmers i can negotiate commerce but i cannot negotiate livelihood security
577452 it is disheartening to know that the talks collapsed over the issue of a reasonable trigger point needed to safeguard the livelihood concerns of millions of subsistence farmers in developing countries even the 10 percent import surge proposal from india and other countries was very liberal
577453 i am happy that developing countries could not be divided or pushed around but i am not that happy that the talks failed
577454 in the wto each one of the 153 member countries has a vote that does not depend on the size of the country or the volume of its international trade this ensures that the writ of the large and the powerful does not prevail and is hence good for small developing countries
577455 as food prices go up further in the u s and in europe many poor countries including quite a few in africa that are dependent on food imports would get hurt very badly leading to more poverty social tension and political turmoil
577456 why have representatives of only 30 countries been mainly involved in the geneva talks what about the interests of the remaining 123 countries the wto negotiations have become a joke
577457 whereas the rich act as bullies the emerging developing countries are not exactly holy cows who are doing a lot to improve livelihood conditions for their subsistence farmers
577458 the ability of trade to dampen country specific macroeconomic problems for example due to high food prices will be greatly reduced

577463 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
577464 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
577465 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
577466 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
577467 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
577468 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
577469 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
577470 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
577471 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
577472 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
577473 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
577474 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
577475 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
577476 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
577477 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
577478 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
577479 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
577480 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
577481 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
577482 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
577483 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
577484 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
577485 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
577486 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
577487 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
577488 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
577489 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
577490 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
577491 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen

577495 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
577496 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
577497 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
577498 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
577499 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
577500 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
577501 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
577502 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
577503 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
577504 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
577505 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
577506 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
577507 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
577508 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
577509 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
577510 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
577511 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
577512 were constantly looking at what polling places were looking at are they sufficient in size are they meeting the needs of the population
577513 the dorms arent open so no one shows up to vote

577516 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
577517 the first time she was diagnosed i was a very young girl
577518 it was devastating for my mother to lose one of her breasts and have to go through all that
577519 it is a very personal cancer for the women it affects this is about womens womanhood its one of the aspects of our femininity
577520 signing luol has always been a priority for this organization
577521 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
577522 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
577523 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
577524 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
577525 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
577526 we face serious issues in this election and have real differences
577527 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars i will however compare our two visions for our economic future
577528 the world faces a global climate emergency it is now clear that only action by both developed and developing countries can prevent the from deepening
577529 the aim is to limit global temperature increases to two degrees above pre industrial levels
577530 the time is right for the countrys private sector to show leadership by partnering with government to develop a solutions driven and adaptation response
577531 the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of mitigating the effects of climate change
577532 our emissions per capita are higher than many other developing countries south africas emissions per capita are also high due to our coal based energy system

577537 it was tough being stuck in our own zone for the last ten or fifteen minutes but credit to the guys for sticking in there and making it happen
577538 we always knew it was going to be tougher game its the final everyone notches it up a couple of levels
577539 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
577540 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
577541 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
577542 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
577543 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
577544 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
577545 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
577546 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
577547 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
577548 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
577549 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
577550 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
577551 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
577552 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
577553 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
577554 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
577555 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
577556 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
577557 mel oliver come in cap youre crossing the bottom of a ship coming at you
577558 we just took his tow the barge is right in front of us and were running it over
577559 todos saben que por m s que digan que a maradona la llave no se le dio si se le acerc y la dejaron tirada ser problema del cuerpo t cnico tomar la decisi n vivamos el d a a d a que es necesario
577560 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
577561 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
577562 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
577563 we arent in sudan are we because were not allowed to go to sudan
577564 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
577565 we arent in sudan are we because were not allowed to go to sudan
577566 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
577567 we arent in sudan are we because were not allowed to go to sudan
577568 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
577569 we arent in sudan are we because were not allowed to go to sudan
577570 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
577571 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
577572 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
577573 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
577574 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
577575 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
577576 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
577577 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
577578 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
577579 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
577580 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
577581 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
577582 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
577583 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
577584 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
577585 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
577586 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
577587 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
577588 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
577589 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
577590 regardless of what jersey im wearing its the same game ive played my entire life
577591 it was the last thing on my mind which is usually the case when you hit a home run
577592 its certainly great to see a ball leave the ballpark but he hasnt sold out his swing to home runs
577593 hes covering the plate and i think thats just a byproduct of a lot of good swings
577594 putting up nine will help though it gives somebody a little breathing room
577595 when he did throw strikes they werent at the right locations theres no doubt he struggled tonight
577596 might get some type of injection in a couple of days
577597 the way brad ziegler is throwing i could potentially use anybody in any situation right now
577598 i dont want to say that huston street is no longer the closer it might be more how well the other two guys are doing
577599 when you face these kinds of global problems you need as prime minister someone who is respected on the international stage
577600 someone whose hard work and ability over the last 11 years has made britain better off
577601 thats why ive no doubt that gordon brown is the right person for the job
577602 i think gordon brown understands where the problems are coming from better than anybody else in british politics and what we are going to do about them
577603 political mountain to climb in order to win the next election
577604 multitude of small policies are more suited to a sunday afternoon stroll
577605 we must come forward with bold and ambitious policies that begin to change the terms of political debate by putting labour on the front foot and the tories on the defensive
577606 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
577607 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
577608 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
577609 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
577610 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
577611 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
577612 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
577613 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
577614 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
577615 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
577616 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
577617 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
577618 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
577619 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
577620 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
577621 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
577622 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
577623 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
577624 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
577625 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
577626 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
577627 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
577628 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
577629 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
577630 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
577631 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
577632 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day
577633 but obviously if parker is 20 under john rollins has to shoot 10 under if parker is even par so it does put a stretch on everyone including me
577634 but parkers never won before so you never know he might shoot a couple over and around this golf course anything can happen you can hit good shots and get a bad bounce and be really in trouble
577635 it was my first time having a lead and i didnt really approach it the right way and learned a lot from it
577636 that one i looked past the finish line too early and this one im looking forward to the first shot on the first hole tomorrow and thats as far as im going to go
577637 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
577638 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day
577639 but obviously if parker is 20 under john rollins has to shoot 10 under if parker is even par so it does put a stretch on everyone including me
577640 but parkers never won before so you never know he might shoot a couple over and around this golf course anything can happen you can hit good shots and get a bad bounce and be really in trouble
577641 it was my first time having a lead and i didnt really approach it the right way and learned a lot from it
577642 that one i looked past the finish line too early and this one im looking forward to the first shot on the first hole tomorrow and thats as far as im going to go
577643 i thought it was going to be the worst birthday ever after the first three holes
577644 i was surprised how good the scoring was because standing on the range you felt like the golf course was going to play pretty tough since we didnt get the rain overnight as expected and it felt like it was going to dry out as the day went on
577645 i wanted to come out quick and birdie birdie birdie was obviously great but i played pretty solid all day
577646 it could have been a better round than that but youve got to take what it gives you a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference
577647 im excited that im tied for the lead going into the final round
577648 i think itll be a fun shootout theres four guys right there and then theres a big grouping four shots back
577649 so i think that were all in good position i feel like ive played well the first three rounds and im looking forward to a nice shootout tomorrow
577650 i was surprised how good the scoring was because standing on the range you felt like the golf course was going to play pretty tough since we didnt get the rain overnight as expected and it felt like it was going to dry out as the day went on
577651 i wanted to come out quick and birdie birdie birdie was obviously great but i played pretty solid all day
577652 it could have been a better round than that but youve got to take what it gives you a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference
577653 im excited that im tied for the lead going into the final round
577654 i think itll be a fun shootout theres four guys right there and then theres a big grouping four shots back
577655 so i think that were all in good position i feel like ive played well the first three rounds and im looking forward to a nice shootout tomorrow
577656 triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political
577657 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
577658 to thank those nurses those doctors to see patients that were there to bring a bit of greetings from home and profound thanks
577659 its literally not true i was there and obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him
577660 we saw troops everywhere we went we went out of our way to see those troops

577669 lo primordial es que la nueva ley reconozca que las frecuencias radioel ctricas nos pertenecen a todos y que el estado debe administrarlas asegurando la igualdad de oportunidades es imprescindible que diferentes sectores sociales puedan acceder a la titularidad de emisoras de radio y televisi n para garantizar la pluralidad de perspectivas en los modos de producci n de los medios y sus contenidos
577670 al legislarse no se puede ignorar la mercantilizaci n y concentraci n monop lica que hoy tiene el sector si la nueva ley no establece restricciones y no promueve la propiedad y gesti n p blica y social de emisoras de radio y televisi n ser muy dif cil avanzar en el proceso de democratizaci n de las comunicaciones la igualdad que hoy no existe no podr alcanzarse sin una normativa que asegure que los sectores relegados en la radiodifusi n puedan desarrollarse competitivamente
577671 la modificaci n de la ley de radiodifusi n viene siendo eje de debates en muchos mbitos desde la recuperaci n de la democracia no es una discusi n que arranca ahora sino que hay muchos insumos elaborados por universidades sindicatos organismos de derechos humanos asociaciones de medios comunitarios la discusi n hay que plantearla haciendo foco en la defensa y el respeto irrestricto de la libertad de expresi n y de prensa pero sin ignorar que no se trata de un derecho de las empresas ni de los periodistas sino de todos los ciudadanos por eso el debate debe darse con una convocatoria amplia a todos los actores de la comunidad durante un plazo adecuado abriendo espacios de consulta para permitir una intervenci n p blica m ltiple que le d amplia legitimidad al tratamiento legislativo
577672 la nueva ley debe hablar de radio y televisi n digital plante mart n becerra doctor en comunicaci n investigador del conicet y de la universidad nacional de quilmes la digitalizaci n va a multiplicar por cuatro o cinco la actual cantidad de canales de tv abierta si el debate se enclaustra en la cuesti n t cnica en si hay que tomar la norma de tv digital europea o la norteamericana la ley va a quedar obsoleta r pidamente y el riesgo es que se descuide qui n se va a quedar con las licencias hay que trabajar sobre los criterios de concesi n van a ser canales gratuitos o de pago yo creo que deben ser gratuitos el 90 por ciento del territorio de argentina tiene uno o dos canales de tv abierta entonces lo que falta es m s televisi n gratuita como est planteada ahora la discusi n entre el grupo clar n y el gobierno parece que para uno se van a vulnerar derechos adquiridos y para el otro se va a ampliar el derecho a la informaci n y no es as el escenario que abre la tv digital permite licuar ese problema el gobierno podr a respetar las licencias actuales siempre que se establezcan normas democr ticas y un criterio federal para otorgar las nuevas licencias esto se podr a llevar a la pr ctica en la medida en que la futura autoridad de aplicaci n el futuro comfer sea una instituci n p blica no gubernamental
577673 ojal est pero tambi n podr a haber una ley espec fica consider mart n becerra creo que deber a haber un sistema de medios p blicos con un directorio con representaci n del poder ejecutivo del congreso las provincias los trabajadores y especialistas en comunicaci n la designaci n del directorio deber a tener que superar algunos requisitos deber a hacerse p blico el curr culum de los candidatos con la posibilidad de impugnarlos y la designaci n deber a requerir la aprobaci n de dos tercios del congreso una mayor a calificada para que no sea representada s lo la primera minor a pol tica los medios p blicos no deber an tener casi publicidad sino financiamiento p blico con reglas no comerciales la bbc por ejemplo tiene un mecanismo muy interesante cada cinco a os presenta una carta que es un plan de actividades el parlamento trata esa propuesta y le otorga financiamiento por otros cinco a os con lo que se evita el constante problema presupuestario y se abre una perspectiva de trabajo a mediano plazo
577674 lo primero que debe tener la nueva ley y esto es un posicionamiento ideol gico es un fuerte contenido antimonop lico porque a mayor concentraci n menor posibilidad de que haya expresiones m ltiples y plurales en los medios de comunicaci n destac alejandro verano el estado deber a tener herramientas para poder regular m s activamente el acceso a la expresi n en la medida en que se abra el acceso a frecuencias de radio y televisi n para las universidades las organizaciones civiles los sindicatos y otros actores sociales se va a combatir en forma directa la concentraci n monop lica permitiendo la expresi n de intereses y opiniones que hoy no tienen posibilidades
577675 se podr an buscar criterios para limitar la discrecionalidad pero es muy dif cil de regular el p e tiene el derecho y la obligaci n de comunicar las acciones de gobierno y de hacerlo del modo que le parezca m s conveniente algunos piensan en un sistema por el cual las pautas de publicidad se distribuir an en funci n del rating pero eso abre la discusi n sobre la credibilidad de las mediciones del rating y si la publicidad del estado s lo se guiara por un criterio de xito comercial se profundizar an las asimetr as favoreciendo a los medios ligados a los grandes anunciantes en detrimento de medios que pueden desarrollar otra clase de proyectos

577689 if the gospel is being preached with power at our churches

577697 no board agency committee commission or council shall give united methodist funds to any gay caucus or group or otherwise use such funds to promote the acceptance of homosexuality
577698 all entities of the church are bound by the provisions of the discipline and no entity or individual member of the church has the right to negate or ignore the discipline
577699 in fact my guess is that if the holy spirit really showed up in power at more of our services teenagers wouldnt need as many drums guitars and lights and video clips to get their attention
577700 why is the worship service such a sacred cow in churches anyway
577701 during the present quarter the pastor due to the following reasons has discontinued the work at eagles nest first there was no competent nucleus around which could be organized and kept going a sunday school second our baptist brethren have ample facilities for supplying the church needs in that territory and third there was at the last three services at that place so much disorder due to drunkeness that your pastor thought a continuation of services would be dangerous to the people who came to worship as no member of the congregation seemed to take any steps to prevent the recurrence of same conduct at the following services and your pastor did not wish to go into the police business
577702 it is biblical that we gather as a family of god for worship

577719 not everyone is so observant that consulting firm i mentioned also found out that we can save time in the rest room by tying this string to the tip of you know what we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands shortening the time spent in the rest room by 76 39 per cent
577720 after you get it out how do you put it back
577721 i dont know about the others but i use en espa ol

577723 documentation identifying the evidence and how it was handled had been neglectfully and erroneously entered misleadingly created and or willingly destroyed which gave a false sense of accuracy to the documents
577724 no evidence was found that suggested det martinez improperly influenced the investigation or intentionally mishandled evidence because of his relationship with reimers niece
577725 checks and balances are now in place to detect any errors if an officer fails to properly pack label or document evidence
577726 i know there are millions of women out there who are looking for a man to share the outdoors with them

577730 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world
577731 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
577732 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
577733 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
577734 air traffic control noticed what they thought was smoke coming from the back of the aircraft
577735 what it turned out to be was a hydraulic leak of hydraulic fluid coming out of the hydraulic system creating a fine spray at the back of the aircraft that looked like smoke
577736 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
577737 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
577738 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
577739 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
577740 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
577741 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
577742 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
577743 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
577744 this kind of worldwide popularity is something we need in the us right now
577745 had we had a little better feel or a little better read on that at every step of the way i would have said hello to him walking down the hall
577746 its a different world for him and i think it should be
577747 and i think that were going to be a benefactor of that
577748 i feel like im the same as ive always been
577749 try to throw the ball to the guy whos open that usually helps
577750 obviously his lifes changed 100 percent but hes the same guy a little bit more guarded maybe but for the most part hes the same guy
577751 at that point in time it was a situation where i felt like i had to have his back
577752 he had been tearing us up since weve been here
577753 i dont think anybody would have thats why its been such a phenomenon
577754 theres no question that having a competitive quarterback does inspire you if youre in my shoes and youre trying to make those decisions
577755 the closer you feel like youre getting then the more youre motivated to go ahead and extend
577756 there is always a little nostalgia in some ways about the process and what it took to get where you are its funny you still have a long way to go
577757 im trying to play im trying to get on the field and get better the exciting thing really about the game is just improvement
577758 theyre a little better than i am theres good reason for that
577759 we can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country
577760 we have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home
577761 as a nation we can have more control over our energy destiny by supplying more of the oil and natural gas well be consuming from resources here at home
577762 girls here dont like to marry men from india as they find them too traditional and girls in india dont wish to move to the us as they are well qualified and have good careers generally people find someone when still in college but if they dont it is hard to find someone or meet the right people when you are working hard at your job here they get to meet around 150 girls over two days
577763 for those who havent found someone we are telling them this is also a way and we are making it easier by bringing similar people together
577764 all this means that the marriage life will be longer

577850 thats how you get rid of blisters you piss on them
577851 weve been looking forward to it since day one of practice coming here to play these guys
577852 its just sometimes we go away from it too much
577853 we should have jumped on them when we had them in the first half
577854 the only way youre going to beat a team of this caliber is to jump on them quick they were flat and we didnt take advantage of that
577855 even though that was happening we should have got those passes completed on those quick slants thats how we couldve beat those quick blitzes but execution didnt happen like we expected it to
577856 for us we have to drive 15 or 20 minutes to anyplace
577857 you need off for what you need off for the fair you have what cows theres cows in niagara county
577858 so we have more of those than people at home
577859 in new york city they have no idea at all they think niagara is a tree place
577860 its surprising but at the same time you expected it its a city kid
577861 new york city is nice to visit its nice to see but id never want to live there i wouldnt be able to
577862 i sacrificed myself for this camp and did my best
577863 he thought i was going to break down but i didnt i went ahead and did my best
577864 his route running is coming along and so are his ball skills
577865 hes made some pretty good catches but obviously what jumps out at you and with everybody is just his speed hes so fast
577866 what i find in our league with our players is if you make it important to them and you make it seem important to them all of a sudden they focus on this a lot more
577867 i think you throw out the positives to them and you say hey this is what we need to do this is what we need to work on
577868 and one of the things me and teddy talked about early on in the spring is that hey your catching the ball fast at the end but from a to b its taking you a little bit of time we need that and i told him that will improve when you start to learn the offense and it has
577869 every day i come out i try to do something different
577870 i try to go in watch film by myself and try to see what im doing wrong the older guys on the defensive side are telling me different things to work on and showing me how to get open showing me when im doing things right and when im doing things wrong
577871 thats what training camp is about its to work together thats all we can do
577872 im not really sure what happened but thats a done issue thats something that obviously people hear stuff im here practicing waiting and i obviously cant wait till the season starts
577873 im in a great frame of mind why wouldnt i be im with a new team a great bunch of guys im looking forward to getting this season on the road and actually looking forward to going into next week and try to put everything together as a team and as an offense
577874 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
577875 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
577876 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
577877 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
577878 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
577879 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
577880 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
577881 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
577882 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
577883 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
577884 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
577885 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
577886 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
577887 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese
577888 we care less about human rights than other countries and more about sovereignty thats bound to create an awkward feeling among other countries
577889 were coming into this year we have a lot less unknowns
577890 were going to play a good football team but i feel a whole lot better about the team were taking in this year with the experience we have than i did a year ago because of the unknowns
577891 we came into the season last year with three new starters that had not played for us
577892 and all of a sudden you look out there and theres a lot of secondary guys that have played a lot of football and i think we got better and better as the year went on last year at our defensive back play
577893 i think theres a good combination of young guys and older guys and size and strength and speed and athleticism that i think it will be much more of a committee situation this year
577894 but during the season chris johnson he caught the hot hand so why not ride it he ended up making a lot of big plays for us
577895 and i feel in better shape its pressure off my knees and my back so thats the real reason i lost it for my health
577896 sometimes as a starter those at bats can kind of be the ones that make or break the game
577897 i wanted to make tough pitches and hopefully make something good happen
577898 theyve got a really good lineup and if you make mistakes they make you pay
577899 unfortunately i made one too many and its kind of a tough one to swallow
577900 i dont know if we want to play the cardinals every day because theyre pretty good but howard seems to play pretty good against them
577901 i think he feels comfortable here hes around his people and hes relaxed
577902 you grew up playing here in front of your family and friends
577903 to be able to do it at the major league level its just like playing back when you were 15
577904 every mistake i throw to him he seems to hit out of the ballpark
577905 im kind of mad at myself i went into that game not wanting ryan howard to beat me and he ended up kind of beating me
577906 ive been pretty much streaky i think most power guys are like that
577907 you always hear that term that they come in bunches but i really only had one good at bat
577908 he kept us off balance moved the ball around the strike zone and just off the strike zone
577909 fasten your seat belts cuz your about to have the ride of your life
577910 the gun go off the race be over he was talking about his own steroid fueled dominance but he could have been describing an average fans view of any 100
577911 this time there is absolutely no pressure on asafa and that might be the best thing for him
577912 why when i tell im busy do you still show up on my doorstep
577913 dont do it its a simple matter of respect when i say no i mean no i dont mean maybe or try it ans see what happens no means no
577914 why did i wait to buy these bermuda shorts they are the most comfortable shorts that ive bought in a long time
577915 drove out the man and at the east of the garden of eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life
577916 sin came into the world through one man and death through sin
577917 only to steal and kill and destroy i came that they may have life and have it abundantly
577918 she wisdom is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her

577924 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
577925 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
577926 when comparing the most advanced mortals in mind and soul condition they are not equal to us in development this makes me wonder what improvement could be made in our condition in order for us to progress should we enter into another mortal body yet strangely we cling to our old belief in reincarnation and congregate together waiting for something that must happen in order for reincarnation to become the destiny of our souls
577927 dont be nihilistic about it dont think its all for naught your heart is the truest form of the self that which is the answer which transcends the question dig take that with you carry it in your pocket let the solar tethers love it from your fabric threads think of it like the threads of fate fragile but so grossly yours and in your possession become your own freemason there may be no absolute truth but there is absolute truth in you
577928 dont you dare leave me alone with all these people
577929 the monitor here says your planes arrived where the heck are you
577930 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
577931 a world renowned and highly decorated scientist who served his country for over 33 years with the department of the army
577932 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
577933 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
577934 but if the f b i was really leaning on him what a tremendous load that was on him
577935 the f b i would be remiss not to look at us especially those of us who worked with anthrax
577936 we were all subjected to lie detector tests we were all interviewed
577937 there are very few people who have their feet in both camps
577938 i would urge the bureau to publish its evidence if it declares the case solved and closed
577939 he fell about as far as you can and he wants to prove to the world that hes not only innocent but that hes back
577940 he was the smartest banker i ever knew he could make companies golden

577949 i dont think you can blame one person for the bubble
577950 but the excesses might not have been as extreme were it not for frank quattrone
577951 before he had a well oiled machine with a bulge bracket behind him
577952 now people can say no to him its going to be very difficult for frank to reclaim his past glory
577953 in certain instances csfbs marketing or pitch materials implicitly promised that a company would receive favorable research if it agreed to use csfb for its investment banking business
577954 the industry should petition to remove the spitzer initiatives because ultimately they hurt the competitiveness of our country by denying small companies access to research analysts
577955 all he did was to take two research analysts who might have told untruths and turn it into an industrywide witch hunt which basically shut down sell side research for companies like many in this audience that are trying to change the world
577956 hes one of the guys who built this valley and he won a lot of friends
577957 we existed on what we could grow in our garden and the kindness of a grocer who extended credit for the meager food we couldnt grow for ourselves
577958 when our shoes wore out to the point of having a large hole in the sole we cut out cardboard to fit and bridged the gap
577959 when you think of maslows hierarchy of needs its food clothing and shelter
577960 during this housing crisis and gas prices going up it affects our food clothing and shelter
577961 i want people to realize were all in this together its affecting every one of us
577962 we as a family are going to be very creative very cool and we want everybodys input if were on the same team
577963 laughter appears to cause the tissue that forms the inner lining of blood vessels the endothelium to dilate or expand in order to increase blood flow
577964 the strongest oak tree of the forest is not the one that is protected from the storm and hidden from the sun its the one that stands in the open where it is compelled to struggle for its existence against the winds and rains and the scorching sun
577965 there was just a gloom that fell over the country
577966 we existed on what we could grow in our graden
577967 the write up sounded like it was a glorified chicken coop
577968 we figured what the heck its a ride we looked at the place fell in love with it and on the way home decided we wanted to buy it
577969 we were in a business where we had no room for storage
577970 it was milling corn wheat and oats for animal feed there was a mill in there where they used to grind flour
577971 great food best beef on a stick period love the sauce it comes
577972 it really hits home when you see a young adult who comes in with congestive heart failure because of their radiation exposure
577973 some survivors of childhood cancer when they become adults dont ever want to see another doctor again
577974 weve tried to reduce late effects but sometimes have gone too far it has become known as killing with kindness
577975 weve tried to cut back on side effects and weve lost some kids
577976 can rapid responders be spared that can we continue to maintain high cure rates
577977 what primary care physician is going to routinely recommend a mammogram for a 25 year old
577978 these young folks want to put the cancer behind them and be like everyone else
577979 but were also telling them youre not normal theyve survived this experience but they have these risks
577980 an adult cardiologist will be familiar with cardiac patients but may not be up to date on heart problems in childhood cancer survivors
577981 weve seen patients who were treated in new york in israel
577982 it is often very challenging to get the medical records their oncologist may no longer be practicing or even alive
577983 sometimes parents dont even tell their children that they had cancer we try to piece the record together as best as we can
577984 we tell parents and patients that just because the most intensive part of treatment is over doesnt mean youre going to feel wonderful psychologically
577985 you have to deal with new problems that you didnt understand early on
577986 how do they find a vocation thats going to be rewarding but will provide them with good pay and benefits that means completing education
577987 what happens to people weve made infertile what happens to them psychologically what happens medically

577989 come here for three or four days ill go off somewhere and you can take care of her and put your theories into practice
577990 the last time we were up all you could talk about was the price of cigarettes
577991 to anoint is to apply perfumed oil it was a common practice among the hebrews the act of anointing was significant of consecration to a holy or sacred use
577992 but you have an anointing from the holy one and all of you know the truth as for you the anointing you received from him remains in you and you do not need anyone to teach you but as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real not counterfeit just as it has taught you remain in him
577993 i tell you the truth anyone who has faith in me will do what i have been doing he will do even greater things than these because i am going to the father
577994 and anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple
577995 he jason is not talking with investigators because it was apparent he was going to be arrested that night november 3 2006
577996 whenever a spouse is murdered under suspicious circumstances one of the first people police are going to look at is the other spouse you have to tell your client that thats to be expected that they ought not be defensive about that
577997 thats just the way it works and partly its because in many many situations it is the spouse who did the crime
577998 for police the assertion of your privilege not to speak with them is tantamount to a confession they assume the client isnt talking because he or she has something to hide and i guess thats a human assumption but its not always the correct assumption
577999 it does throw up a red flag if a spouse does not want to be cooperative with police it looks suspicious
578000 you would think if your spouse was murdered that the person being questioned would want to cooperate and want to get to the bottom of it
578001 if my wife was murdered i would want to do everything in the world to help if youre not guilty you help in every single way youre there youre pounding the pavement youre calling all the time you are there
578002 we do not know because he has refused to talk to us

578010 lifting sanctions and removing north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism flies in the face of history and rewards its brutal dictator for shallow gestures
578011 just as the clinton administration was fooled by the kim jong il regime time will soon tell if the bush administration will fall for the same bait
578012 the administrations call for north korea to be removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list is cause for profound concern
578013 serious verification questions linger and i would have hoped that the administration would have shown more caution and less haste on a matter of this gravity

578022 we like mr obama and we hope he will win the election
578023 this is the election season and everyone wants to sound like a friend of israel
578024 presidential candidate obamas speech may be formulated as follows hunger for the nation remittances as charitable handouts and visits to cuba as propaganda for consumerism and the unsustainable way of life behind it

578045 in a compassionate society people respect one another and take responsibility for the decisions they make in life my hope is to change the culture from one that has said if it feels good do it if youve got a problem blame somebody else to one in which every single american understands that he or she is responsible for the decisions that you make youre responsible for loving your children with all your heart and all your soul youre responsible for being involved with the quality of the education of your children youre responsible for making sure the community in which you live is safe youre responsible for loving your neighbor just like you would like to be loved yourself

578047 now its time for me to focus on developing a 2008 defense bill that serves our troops and our nation
578048 i think the nation respects the mayors leadership after 9 11 and i do too and i think he displayed leadership at a time that americans needed some steady hand and i think that his conduct was very laudatory following 9 11
578049 i dont think it translates necessarily into foreign policy or national security expertise i know of nothing in his background that indicates that he has any experience in it with him or romney

578070 readers from jerome lincoln and gooding counties will receive an expanded time news with weekly sections focusing on those areas
578071 an expansion tacoda is not being shut down but we heard from many of tacodas clients because of the relatively small network it had that it wasnt a very scalable solution on its own
578072 given the fact that publishers must take all advertising com ads to get any behavioral targeting tacoda ads with ad com selling all the ads it sounds like aol has abandoned a large fast growing and very profitable market all in the name of functional alignment with a slower growing legacy business
578073 yes everything is being run through the advertising com server which is why we needed to terminate those previous contracts because weve integrated everything under one p amp l but the targeting technology that is being used is tacodas system
578074 all i can is that there were some people who left there were some we asked to leave but we have the entire tacoda engineering team which is based in fort washington pa and they are the key to tacodas product

578101 the work ethic within the group has been great and we prepared well for this game so i think it just reinforces how tough it is to win away from home and i think we need that heading to south africa

578103 we get a couple of days off now hopefully get the niggles bumps and bruises out of the way and i guess get away from footy because its been pretty full on over the last couple of weeks and get a bit of balance going on

578105 you dont see too many roads without bends in them
578106 to be honest i think we tend to put our own barriers in front of ourselves that arent necessarily there

578117 it was an accumulation of fatigue and sitting on a bike for three weeks which from a posterial and physical point of view is not good for your body
578118 my orthapaedic surgeon told me people have had a lot worse injuries by slipping in their own baths

578135 imagine how your mother will cry when she hears about this
578136 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
578137 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
578138 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
578139 it is in our own self interest to be concerned and certainly from a fiscal standpoint we have an interest in times of financial difficulty we have a fixed amount of money and for every dollar we spend on incarceration we have one dollar less to spend on education and other things this is a challenging public policy question

578143 the mainstream political parties in nepal are beholded to india without indias consistent albeit often tactical support for their objectives nepal would never have democracy in 1990 the dispute between the nepali congress and the communists on foreign policy has essentially been about who has indias ear never on how to eliminate indias influence in nepal or how to cut the kingdoms umbilitical cord with india
578144 intelligence agencies are everywhere around the world but there is no such agency as raw so much criticized
578145 reality is that nepals political parties have failed their country and their people and it would be useless to hope that these political parties can bring stability to nepal so india can only lead to indian support to gyanendra in his efforts to return nepal to stability and a functioning political system because monarchy is the only institution that can prevent the emergence of an unpredictable maoist government in south asia
578146 but overall relation with india has been continuation of past policies

578154 these numbers are a scathing indictment of how profoundly u s and cdc hiv prevention efforts have failed
578155 despite the way the cdc is spinning these new numbers which ahf has been calling for the public release of since last october there is absolutely no good news here without an accurate picture of the epidemic vastly underestimated for the past ten years we have missed countless opportunities to intervene with effective public health strategies the u s must immediately appropriate 200 million in order to test 10 million people over the next three years massive scale up of hiv testing is the only way to bring down these appalling numbers identifying all those who are infected and linking them to treatment is the only way to break the chain of new infections and begin to address the nations runaway epidemic
578156 intensifying market conditions geographical challenges and communication cost have become some of the major drivers of ip telephony deployment within asia pacific

578158 businesses have now started to view the technology not only in terms of cost saving in communication but also from the standpoint of the strategic value it delivers to their operations
578159 ip telephony is not confined within the realm of communication alone but offers scope for integration with other software applications and hardware to achieve productive outcomes

578166 the mission of concord law school has been to expand access to a high quality legal education for students who cannot participate in traditional programs

578184 each of you graduating today is proof of whats possible in your own lives you clearly have the drive and determination to break through barriers and seize opportunities to make a difference for yourselves personally and professionally this graduating class is the embodiment of whats possible when you pursue education
578185 if there is one thing i hope you remember from today its not my words or even those of the others here more eloquent than i but the celebration of this moment of your success your extraordinary accomplishment with your families friends fellow students and teachers may you have many celebrations like this in your life celebrate often and exuberantly and share it with others
578186 the efforts of some very passionate aids activists are paying off in mexico with mercks announcement of significant price cuts on two of its aids drugs stocrin and isentress
578187 though there is still much to be done in the fight for affordable lifesaving aids drugs in mexico and throughout the world including further advocacy focusing on merck we commend merck today for instituting these double digit price reductions in response to activists pleas for lower prices as a means to increase access to antiretroviral treatment throughout mexico we want to ensure that people in need in mexico are not arbitrarily priced out of such lifesaving aids treatments and we will continue to vigorously advocate both government and industry for universal access to antiretroviral treatment
578188 merck will still charge 1 51 usd per patient per day for stocrin in mexico while the drug is available in brazil a country with a similar per capita income for roughly 50 cents per day we have challenged merck before for charging four times as much as they do in other latin american and middle income countries for drugs like stocrin steep pricing effectively makes these drugs all but out of reach for nearly all those living with hiv aids in mexico
578189 over the past year ahf and a growing coalition of aids activists here in mexico have undertaken efforts to make policy makers and the public at large aware of the imbalance in mercks policies regarding the pricing of its aids drugs as compared to how merck prices the same drugs in what are considered least developed countries we also need to continue to push merck on the registration and pricing of the three in one once a day combination therapy atripla to make certain that people in need in mexico and elsewhere have access to this lifesaving regimen

578206 devoted to the history of science and its cultural influences
578207 laboratory specialists could better communicate the key ideas of their research with their publics if they attended carefully to the relationship between form and content in their public interventions
578208 if scientists ignore the arguments to be found there in popular culture they exacerbate a sense of disenfranchisement on the part of the public in regards to science
578209 boy you guys are slow ill meet you ahead at the food court
578210 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
578211 if you have a green party i want to join
578212 regardless of your motivation or agenda in conducting debates i do not intend my campaign schedule to be influenced by a minor party candidate who had to be drafted to run
578213 you and your supporters tout you as the qualified candidate
578214 while there is nothing wrong with your real life experiences and employment as a pizza delivery person and a food market clerk i do not feel it qualifies you to be a prc commissioner you mention repeatedly your advocacy for voting initiatives perhaps you are not aware that the prc does not deal with voting issues perhaps you would consider applying your self professed talents to running for county clerk in 2012
578215 your only qualification seems to be your employment by the title insurance industry which represents an enormous conflict of interest given the prc sets the price of title insurance in new mexico
578216 how can the voters trust you to represent them on rate hearings involving an industry for which you were on the payroll and may still be
578217 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
578218 if you have a green party i want to join
578219 we are hearing from the launch control center that there has been an anomaly on the vehicle
578220 we dont have any information about what that anomaly is at this time
578221 all that mrs simpson miller will be doing is to confirm her intention to continue her work as president of the peoples national party
578222 he has a record of challenging incumbents and there is a record of the outcome
578223 dr phillips is confident of victory based on the strong support he is getting from the delegates and the moral support from scores of jamaicans who believe he could lead the party and the country
578224 that is arrant nonsense and would make a mockery of the leadership race we are very clear of what our intentions are and where our support lies
578225 yes people are investing but the informality of a significant portion of the economy doesnt allow the investment particularly in tourism to create the local linkages that it could
578226 people are informal business operators so they cant consistently deliver the kind of quality in the kinds of quantities that these guys investors want
578227 i dont see it i cant say that peoples consumption is dropping because there is so much happening employment has increased
578228 for the majority of the all inclusive guests they are going to make sure that they have their three meals per day
578229 the restaurants have seen better days in the 80s and 70s
578230 your average rate per room is far greater in the all inclusive it employs more persons of ratio to room so you would have better occupancies and hopefully better income
578231 he is to be interviewed monday and later on he will be charged
578232 utterances were made about getting him into court on monday so i would imagine that if they are saying that then one would expect that
578233 based on the allegations they could not be connected to this matter and it is a breach of these peoples constitutional rights
578234 it is the weekend and they were not able to get in touch with their lawyer until today saturday when i got that information
578235 when our athletes perform at the olympics world championships pan american games and so on they always leave everybody with a positive feeling about jamaica and our accomplishments
578236 this olympics will be no exception people will be taking note of us brand jamaica is known throughout the world because of our sporting achievements
578237 the awesomeness of being before the eyes of four billion people is not something we can pay for the benefits that can accrue from that kind of publicity to destination jamaica is unquantifiable
578238 so i take great pleasure in being associated with this launch
578239 the resuscitation programme of fields is now in place by end of year it will be boosted by 10 per cent
578240 the babys lungs were underdeveloped and about 12 a m this morning saturday he developed complications and died

578243 i felt like i was having menstrual cramps initially but the pain became more severe getting stronger and stronger

578251 these centres or programmes can be hosted in churches community centres or schools they can be funded by civil society government and churches communities that have already established homework centres can simply expand their programmes to include the care of the younger children
578252 the essence of these centres is simply to extend the period of love and care these boys obviously receive from school while shortening the period of time they spend experiencing violence and hardship in their communities

578261 you may think you understand your religion less than you really do

578264 the reality of darkness and coldness and emptiness is so great
578265 that nothing touches my soul did i make a mistake
578266 we need to try a different direction with the pitching staff a different message its not that anything mark and dom said was doing anything wrong with these guys in fact in another situation another group another time i would love to work with these guys again sometimes people and players respond to different voices different messages
578267 we felt we werent seeing the progress we wanted to see
578268 people respond to different people differently we hope that this will be that situation being aggressive having a presence out there and attacking the zone and keeping the ball in play thats part of the message that well continue to send and well see how it goes
578269 i know how it works our pitching hasnt been very good i accept the responsibility hopefully they can get some things straightened out
578270 wire reports indicate that andy hawkins has been named pitching coach of the high a af liate owned by the brett sports group which also owns the rangers short season a club in over the years that ive been writing this newsletter there have been no more than two or three minor league coaches that ive encountered to be as consistently praised by ranger prospects as hawkins who served as pitching coach for low a savannah in 2001 and 2002 low a clinton in 2003 and high a stockton in 2004
578271 these two guys are going to get the same level of respect dom and mark got from everybody here
578272 its a tough league to pitch in and these young kids have growing pains
578273 come see our art upcoming show at the fire house
578274 he said earlier in the year that he expects a perfect game every start and thats the attitude he shows every time you cant teach his drive on the mound

578282 do you believe in buddha i asked him yes i do but not ganesh he replied buddha has helped me realize myself buddha is the only one who could show the way to the masses
578283 so why do you need to keep uttering his name why do you not walk the way and be yourself
578284 is it not true that this fulfills an emotional need within you and if one turns to ganesha or anyone for the same reason why must i call him wrong at the worst he still has to grow just as we all are growing
578285 buddha is the only truth and there is only one person in the world who has called all as buddhas
578286 but there are many who have said you are the purusha you are that you are that soul you are the self you are the being realized by the wise and the men of knowledge the scriptures have proclaimed quiet explicitly tat tvam asi prajnam brahm ayam atma brahm aham brahmasmi
578287 i do not believe in scriptures these are outdated scriptures which do not even have a literary value
578288 when i came to this city i came across these printouts that gave information about the city the eateries the hangouts the places to chill out the people to turn to in case of need for things on hire rentals or miscellaneous information etc some of this information was a bit out dated as some of the phone numbers had changed some of the people had stopped offering the erstwhile services though were still available to help with information and leads it also had your contact
578289 yes i know but i do not offer the services anymore
578290 of course but dont you think had i contacted you you could have made my visit more interesting more useful and productive and maybe provided me with leads as well
578291 do you not think the same can be said about our scriptures as well moreover these words of understanding and works were not printed on a machine printer but had to be recognized by many learned people before being handed over to the brahmacharis to write them as all the work had to be done by hand painstakingly perseveringly so obviously it cannot be sheer nonsense and must have been recognized as useful by many

578303 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
578304 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
578305 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
578306 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
578307 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
578308 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
578309 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
578310 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
578311 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
578312 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
578313 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good

578341 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
578342 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
578343 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
578344 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
578345 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
578346 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
578347 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
578348 it is very disappointing to see the new cabinet list
578349 the new cabinet cannot give thais any hope in dealing with the economic situation

578361 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
578362 o dave theres not much new here other than possibly the catalyst
578363 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
578364 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
578365 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
578366 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
578367 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
578368 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
578369 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
578370 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
578371 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
578372 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
578373 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
578374 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
578375 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
578376 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
578377 i feel happy because for sure to be no 1 is hard work from a long long time ago
578378 the way he was playing we all thought he was not going to lose any time soon
578379 i tried not to think about his winning streak and his new ranking
578380 during all this tournament i didnt play my best much
578381 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge
578382 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
578383 the american people are rightly frustrated by the failure of democratic leaders in congress to enact common sense solutions the development of the oil resources on the outer continental shelf
578384 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
578385 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
578386 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
578387 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
578388 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
578389 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
578390 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
578391 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
578392 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
578393 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
578394 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
578395 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
578396 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
578397 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
578398 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
578399 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
578400 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
578401 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
578402 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
578403 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
578404 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
578405 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
578406 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
578407 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
578408 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
578409 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
578410 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
578411 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
578412 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
578413 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
578414 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
578415 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
578416 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
578417 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
578418 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
578419 were not going to do it with the democrats saying well get around to it someday
578420 if none of us have breaking points none of us have a moral compass
578421 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
578422 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
578423 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
578424 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
578425 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
578426 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
578427 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
578428 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
578429 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
578430 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
578431 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
578432 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
578433 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
578434 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
578435 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
578436 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
578437 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
578438 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
578439 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
578440 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
578441 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
578442 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
578443 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
578444 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
578445 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
578446 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
578447 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
578448 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
578449 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
578450 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
578451 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
578452 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
578453 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
578454 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
578455 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
578456 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
578457 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
578458 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
578459 it is not the arrival but the journey which matters
578460 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
578461 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
578462 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
578463 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
578464 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
578465 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
578466 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
578467 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
578468 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
578469 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
578470 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
578471 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
578472 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
578473 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
578474 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
578475 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
578476 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
578477 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
578478 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
578479 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
578480 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
578481 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
578482 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
578483 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
578484 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
578485 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
578486 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
578487 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
578488 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
578489 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
578490 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
578491 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
578492 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
578493 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
578494 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
578495 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
578496 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
578497 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
578498 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
578499 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
578500 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
578501 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
578502 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
578503 if the vice president says its do able i believe
578504 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
578505 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
578506 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
578507 nos repugna que de juana est en la calle pero creemos en la ley
578508 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
578509 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
578510 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
578511 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
578512 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
578513 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
578514 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
578515 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
578516 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
578517 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
578518 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
578519 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
578520 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
578521 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
578522 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
578523 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
578524 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
578525 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
578526 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
578527 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
578528 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
578529 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
578530 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
578531 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
578532 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
578533 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
578534 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
578535 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
578536 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
578537 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
578538 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
578539 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
578540 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
578541 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
578542 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
578543 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
578544 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
578545 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
578546 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
578547 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
578548 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
578549 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
578550 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
578551 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
578552 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
578553 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
578554 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
578555 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
578556 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
578557 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
578558 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
578559 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
578560 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
578561 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
578562 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
578563 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
578564 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
578565 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
578566 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
578567 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
578568 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
578569 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
578570 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
578571 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
578572 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
578573 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
578574 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
578575 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
578576 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
578577 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
578578 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
578579 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
578580 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
578581 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
578582 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
578583 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
578584 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
578585 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
578586 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
578587 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
578588 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
578589 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
578590 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
578591 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
578592 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
578593 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
578594 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
578595 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
578596 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
578597 the transistor is the most studied device in the world
578598 to make it work as a memory we had to find something different
578599 amd is considering this technology for our highest end microprocessors
578600 however we do believe if successful at that we could see this migrate down to lower cost versions as well
578601 came back with something not just dramatically lower in power but significantly faster and denser
578602 the only disadvantage i saw with the renesas design was the area penalty
578603 we feel gen1 is better than those but its comparable
578604 but gen2 is such a radical step forward particularly in power consumption that it puts it in a unique league
578605 gen2 looks significantly better than anything else that im aware of higher density lower power better performance as well
578606 graphics chips have all the same problems that microprocessors have
578607 but without giving away any details perhaps adoption is likely to be a lot earlier than wed thought
578608 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
578609 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
578610 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
578611 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
578612 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
578613 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
578614 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
578615 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet muhammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
578616 the incident took place at 9 15 pm on saturday when 50 labourers were returning home to mansi in khagaria district
578617 weve had no problems the last two summers now but we need to remain cautious
578618 david missed a lot of time last year but he works as hard as anyone and cares as much as anyone
578619 hes not playing the way he knows he can and hes as upset about it as anyone
578620 when you get to be my age you begin to ask yourself have i lost my mojo
578621 i dont know too many ways to change what i do so i shaved my mustache got a new glove and a tip on throwing my breaking ball from a certain broadcaster who should be in the hall of fame but isnt
578622 guys come up and say who is that out there is it byrd and i quick pitch them and get strike one
578623 morneau is the last batter in the league i want to see up in that situation
578624 i was just happy he didnt hit a grand slam
578625 now i know if i have a bad night ill be back out there the next day with a chance to correct my mistakes

578628 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
578629 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
578630 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
578631 i dont care if kimmer is the jolly green giant or a robot or a fat guy smoking cigars the diet works and that is all i care about
578632 to whoever knows to do good but doesnt do it to that person it is sin
578633 i guess weekly forecast grab the pepto bismol were going to have some fun
578634 tony blair continues to be 100 supportive of gordon brown and the government
578635 junked the tb policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place

578637 a child from a deprived background is 193 times more likely to leave school without a single good gcse than they are to get three as at a level

578643 the thing that makes judaism dangerous to everybody to every race to every nation every idea is that we smash things that arent true we dont believe in the nation state we dont believe in the idea of these individual gods that protect individual groups of people judaism teaches us to see that these are artificial constructions in a sense our detractors have us right in that we are a corrosive force breaking down the false gods of all nations and all peoples because they are not real and that is upsetting to people

578662 i dont like pale imitations and shades of things and i am always wary when people go jazzy because jazz is the best cover up for a lack of talent and the cover up for her which is probably the guilt trip is that she requires vast amounts of drugs to hide the fact that she is fake

578680 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
578681 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
578682 we are still often caught in the bind of thinking of shakespearean tragedy as timeless when in fact it is very much time bound
578683 in other words there is a very specific origin to the way we make sense of literary form that in the early modern period may well have been understood differently this is partly because the early modern concept of the individual was different from modern notions of the individual and his or her relation to social structures
578684 can we remake shakespearean tragedy so that rather than locked in a notion of the timeless it can speak to our time
578685 it is a privilege to host jean howard as this years alice griffin fellow as well as a hood fellow
578686 her work is internationally important and i am sure any reader of shakespeare will be keen to hear her discuss his tragedies and their relation to his time and ours

578692 sure people may have hated him at the time and he did order the deaths of thousands upon thousands innocent iraqis but how can you fault him for these results
578693 they accelerated this as a result of pams death on monday

578699 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
578700 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
578701 kate was way too desperate a woman who clearly cant be on her own without a man in her life at all times
578702 she has no talent im sure paris would tell you that herself
578703 shes got a look that a lot of younger girls liked and copied hilton managed to gain fame because the timing was right for her
578704 a lot of younger women looked up to her shes a very sweet nice girl but thats it then you put a full stop its over so id say paris is infamous
578705 its a dumb thing to say i dont think that makes paris and me similar i dont go to clubs i dont party i dont dance on tables and i dont like sex tapes
578706 after years of attempted dialogue islam and christianity have begun to find consensus on subjects of shared interest
578707 these topics range from the family to pollution poverty and the distribution of natural resources
578708 we have noted that the pontiff holds more advanced views on this subject than most of society and we would like public broadcasters to devote more air time to inter religious dialogue
578709 this would help counter prejudiced notions that islam is a violent religion to be discriminated against
578710 ci sono almeno 27 validi motivi per innamorarsi di linux
578711 it came to me that this woman loves and worships the same god i do
578712 i had this sharpened awareness that in that moment she was in touch with god just as i was it was a dawning and an awakening and it was liberating because it liberates you from standing on a pedestal and looking down on someone else
578713 beyond 9 11 christians and muslims together a new world vision
578714 is that we can find a way to bridge the chasm between christians muslims jews hindus and buddhists and make atlanta a model city that over the next year or two we can develop an interfaith immersion program
578715 a soft evangelical i ask questions and listen rather than telling people what they ought to do or believe
578716 im the most unlikely candidate for becoming a spokesperson about islam
578717 i wondered who i was now that i wasnt a teacher preacher traveler or speaker
578718 you get beneath the dogma and creeds to the essence of what religion is about its about god in human beings in human consciousness
578719 a voice in my head said and you dont know anything about islam which was true i have five degrees four of them theological and other religions had never been taught seriously to me
578720 everything about my faith is rooted in the stories my two grandmothers told me
578721 no one formally taught me to pray as a child i had the question what is god like my grandmother answered that is like a drop in the ocean trying to understand what the ocean is like this is something i feel with my heart god is present in everything god is all around us
578722 there were a couple of imams muslim clerics and im thinking they know all this stuff and im stumbling around in it
578723 we had a pastor and an imam describe how they came to the faith that gives their lives meaning
578724 and we asked people to talk at their tables about how their faith came to them
578725 i dont think just knowledge about another faith is any good
578726 youve gotta meet someone who is of the faith who is speaking out of conviction and out of experience to really feel what islam is like
578727 puts muslims at ease because hes mastered the broad historical perspective of islam but also some of the nuanced details
578728 people are more open to learning a new perspective from someone they respect ben is not trying to convert anyone but to inform people and build understanding
578729 when i heard him talk about islam i thought we need him
578730 many christians are fearful of islam so they put up barriers they trust ben so they are willing to take the first step and listen for understanding
578731 if you sit in silence you can get deep enough into your faith that it touches another person
578732 the reality is that at the core were all the same
578733 in my 76th year i would be passionate about getting christians jews muslims and hindus together nothing in my history would point me in this direction this is not my dream i think its the spirit of god
578734 iraq has stepped up its quest for nuclear weapons and has embarked on a worldwide hunt for materials to make an atomic bomb bush administration officials said today
578735 in the last 14 months iraq has sought to buy thousands of specially designed aluminum tubes
578736 if it could be demonstrated that was a fact would you be in support of such limited attacks in iran
578737 militants from the lebanese group hezbollah have been training iraqi militia fighters at a camp near tehran
578738 the training the americans say is carried out at several camps near tehran that are overseen by the quds force of the islamic revolutionary guard command and the instruction is carried out by militants from hezbollah which has long been supported by the quds force
578739 f ormer congressman bill janklow a democrat from south dakota was convicted of striking and killing a motorcyclist with his car in 2003 he was sentenced to 100 days in prison
578740 i do a great deal of analysis of sen barack obamas autobiography
578741 obama first presents his father as a great hero and the truth was his father was a polygamist and a alcoholic
578742 some of you have some thoughts youd like to share about yesterdays sketch on the premature presidency of barack obama
578743 ive decided to approach todays chat as a wine writer would today i am inaugurating the whine enthusiast in which i will rate your whines
578744 i finally heard back from the maariv spokesman who denied that the obama campaign leaked the memo to them or gave them approval to print it and who disavowed the alleged spokesman who gave quotes to at least four israeli publications
578745 the launch of the product was premature and i dont believe that cuil has what it takes to be a contender
578746 i think pryor is going to be great at ohio state
578747 just to put him in the game shows you how good hes going to be his rating in the game shows you how much confidence everyone has in him
578748 im as anxious as everybody to see what its going to look like
578749 they didnt put tebow in to do the things leak can do
578750 they put tebow in to do things that maybe wasnt leaks nature you would think the same would be true if there were things that terrelle could do that perhaps todd doesnt do
578751 so i think that makes a lot of sense if there are some things that terrelle demonstrates he can add to the package that maybe arent todds strong suit then maybe you can find that mixture of everyones strengths
578752 my coaches were really good at developing packages for guys
578753 where you just get him five to 10 plays and those are the 10 plays he knows hes going to run and then he can get comfortable and confidence is just such a huge thing i would be very hesitant to put a guy in a compromising situation early in his career
578754 you have so much time to get ready to face an offense and if beanie wells is the primary focus and the power game and a quarterback that isnt very mobile thats your focus
578755 now all of a sudden you have to spend a certain amount of time on ok when they get to the red zone or when pryor comes in this is the defensive philosophy when we see no 2 back there this is the defense that were going to run
578756 it takes time away from your preparation to stop beanie wells and todd boeckman
578757 if he can adjust to the preparation and learn the defenses
578758 it does so much for you beyond just being fast

578765 weve seen these types of worms before typically around myspace
578766 people are more trusting of things they receive from a friend
578767 it has been three years since i worked around the clock pleading with other myspace intermix shareholders to vote against the sale of myspace to news corp in 2005
578768 i knew that the value of the company was billions of dollars however the deceptive practice of hiding myspace financials by intermix management robbed shareholders of their opportunity to adequately gauge the companys value
578769 before making an application default on we require a few things access to the sites structured data through semantic markup or a data feed a well designed and broadly useful application and positive user metrics
578770 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage we started with yelp linkedin and yahoo local because they were among our first partners to share structured data
578771 our tests uncovered that users found these apps useful in fact in some cases we saw a lift in click through rate of as high as 15 percent

578774 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
578775 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
578776 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
578777 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
578778 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
578779 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
578780 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
578781 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
578782 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
578783 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
578784 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
578785 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
578786 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
578787 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
578788 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
578789 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
578790 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
578791 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
578792 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
578793 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
578794 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
578795 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
578796 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
578797 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
578798 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
578799 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
578800 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
578801 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
578802 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
578803 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
578804 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
578805 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
578806 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
578807 do you know how bad it looks for me that you call yourself a milf
578808 dont rush home if you go away for thanksgiving this year were off to a wedding for his wifes niece
578809 well good for her but dont hold your breath for it to happen to me
578810 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy sitting next to him repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
578811 when he was attacking him he was calm it was like he was at the beach
578812 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
578813 he went back to his seat and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it to us like that and then dropped it on the ground in front of us
578814 the incident was very tragic but was an isolated event

578948 poetry is the art of saying what you mean but disguising it
578949 writing books begins in talking about it like most human projects and in being close to those who have already done what you propose to do
578950 the vigilance and skepticism needed for reviewing are not a big help when it comes to fiction writing where one needs to be relaxed and natural
578951 i read a writers almanac on the internet every morning and am very grateful to be able to do so

579003 if china can beat the u s it will mean that although we are not number one in military power in sports we are our athletes can defeat the americans in spirit
579004 the games are going to be highly competitive because almost all of the worlds elite athletes will be here in beijing

579006 they are playing the same game that the soviets and east germany did going for sports with high medal counts that the united states is not all that good in
579007 i dont think there are going to be a lot of head to head matchups between top chinese and u s athletes theyre going to kill us in table tennis and well probably kill them in swimming
579008 what china is building is this infrastructure that will have a long lasting impact on their sports programs
579009 getting here did not come without controversy as im sure it did with some of the guys sitting behind me
579010 but through it all im here with a greater appreciation for something not every player is able to achieve and for the people who stood up for me and spoke out on my behalf

579024 since i do not have any children myself i passed this question onto my 23 year old sister whose husband had left her two years ago she has two children she works two jobs to make ends meet she told me that after the divorce and healing process which took about a year she decided to put herself back out on the proverbial market she got together with some girlfriends and started going out to bars and clubs on a semi monthly basis she told me that she met tons of guys who just adored children but seemed to be out for a one night stand only
579025 be on your toes at all times and trust your instinct if you meet a potential match online make it clear to him that you have children and they are your priority in life
579026 you can also research the men you are talking to
579027 hes moderately attractive successful and looking for a nice average girl to settle down with and have 2 5 kids a golden retriever and an average sized yard in a housing development in some generic suburb the scorned
579028 if you do meet this guy tell him to call you when hes done grieving
579029 dude sketching in your notepad does not classify you as an artist sorry your date will be something that doesnt cost any money because he has none
579030 after a couple of good im sessions he thinks youre his girlfriend as soon as you log on he will be waiting for you thirty seconds after youve signed into im he pops up saying hello if you dont respond right away hell get all worried hell say things like what am i not as hot as the guys you usually date you know im so sick of games i thought you were different hes a psycho
579031 this guy should make you wary because it seems like hes trying too hard to show you how lovable he is whats next him posing with a basket of kittens in a nursery of newborn babies stay away from this one
579032 she wondered if that was her future joining the ranks of the citys single mothers too tired to cook forcing snippets of conversation with children
579033 despite whatever pain any of us must face at times a point comes where you have to make a choice about how you want to spend the rest of your life and the example you want to set for your children that doesnt mean the sadness goes away but that you allow other things to enter so yes this is my experience i think being open to finding love again is really important what other choice makes sense
579034 in a funny way being honest about my husbands alcoholism was one of the hardest parts of writing this novel for a long time i felt shame about it and deciding to be completely open about it was good for me and i hope helpful for other people in similar situations
579035 well we are a society that has come to expect closure as our right but its not always possible and without firm answers it is hard to come to terms with something understand it and move on it is harder to give up hope and far easier to get stuck in limbo someone told me to think about it as a locked room you can knock on that door for the rest of your life but youll never get in at a certain point you have to make the decision to walk away from it that doesnt mean youre not always aware of it but you have to accept that uncertainty will be a part of your life it is by far the hardest part of my personal story though
579036 as a locked room you can knock on that door for the rest of your life but youll never get in at a certain point you have to make the decision to walk away from it
579037 first of all i dont really describe the act itself in much detail so it seemed natural to leave birth control out i assume the reader can take it as a given and use his her imagination a bit

579043 i stopped smoking july 1st 2007 i enjoy procrastinating i drink far less alcohol then the average person i dont care for sports or animals i believe its okay to spit i hate studying i use only paper plates disposable cups and plasticware i prefer to cut my own hair i sleep 10 12 hrs a night i go to bed after midnight i havent seen my parents in ten years im very organized and neat i rearrange my money so that all the presidents face the same way i reconsider things indefinitely before making a decision i like oriental noodle soups i hate rap r amp b i hate marijuana id like to meet someone that lives close to me or has transportation if you have personality issues please leave me alone

579073 hindsight is 20 20 but i think that what i am absolutely convinced of is at that time we had to change the political debate because the view of the bush administration at that time was one that i just disagreed with and one that i continue to disagree with is to look narrowly at iraq and not focus on these broader issues
579074 thats why i have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by march of 2008
579075 look narrowly at iraq and not focus on these broader issues
579076 a timetable that doesnt take into account what they anticipate might be a change in conditions
579077 my job is to think about the national security interests as a whole and to weigh and balance risks in afghanistan and iraq
579078 their job is just to get the job done here and i completely understand that
579079 i think that i did not anticipate and i think that this is a fair characterization the convergence of not only the surge but the sunni awakening in which a whole host of sunni tribal leaders decided that they had had enough with al qaeda in the shiia community the militias standing down to some degrees so what you had is a combination of political factors inside of iraq that then came right at the same time as terrific work by our troops had those political factors not occurred i think that my assessment would have been correct
579080 we have made our position abundantly clear to the israelis and indeed to the world not just in our public statements but in our private conversations as well
579081 there is uniformity across the u s government about the way to proceed with iran
579082 everyone from this white house including the vice presidents office is in agreement that the military option is not the best option at this point and we should pursue diplomatic and economic pressures
579083 an american commitment to deterrence especially if seen by israelis as a substitute for prevention is itself likely to spur israel to consider independent action
579084 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
579085 its clear that the atheists aggressive agenda is to remove gods name from schools from currency from nature programs and history books and at the same time fill movies and television with his name used in blasphemy
579086 graduation for the iraqi military academy at rustimiyah as 252 young men graduated from the one year course of instruction and were commissioned as 2nd lieutenants in the iraqi army and air force
579087 as should have been apparent to president bush and sen john mccain
579088 this is not vietnam or somalia or those places where you can walk away
579089 if we just pull out we will find ourselves back in short order
579090 it may be necessary to surge them for a short term
579091 i do believe more troops are required on the ground
579092 we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in
579093 should these benchmarks be met the plan allows for the temporary suspension of this redeployment subject to the agreement of congress
579094 is making significant progress in reducing sectarian violence in iraq and in reducing the size and operational effectiveness of sectarian militias in iraq
579095 the plan would also retain some u s forces in iraq and the region to help deter atrocities by sectarian militias and aggression from iraqs neighbors
579096 in redeploying the armed forces from iraq under this section appropriate units of the armed forces should be redeployed 1 to the united states 2 to afghanistan in order to enhance united states military operations in that country 3 elsewhere in the region to serve as an over the horizon force to prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war to reassure allies of the united states of the commitment of the united states to remain engaged in the region and to position troops to strike directly at al qaeda and 4 elsewhere to meet urgent united states security needs
579097 moreover until we change our approach in iraq it will be increasingly difficult to refocus our efforts on the challenges in the wider region on the conflict in the middle east where hamas and hezbollah feel emboldened and israels prospects for a secure peace seem uncertain on iran which has been strengthened by the war in iraq and on afghanistan where more american forces are needed to battle al qaeda track down osama bin laden and stop that country from backsliding toward instability
579098 we are continuing this policy in bleeding america to the point of bankruptcy we alongside the mujahedeen bled russia for 10 years until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat it is easy for us to provoke and bait this administration
579099 youve quoted me this way but you could find other quotes as well
579100 he has been a voice on the senate armed services committee and he has traveled all over the world but he hasnt held executive responsibility that large squadron in the navy that he commanded that wasnt a wartime squadron
579101 i dont think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president
579102 sen obama unfortunately like a lot of the democratic leadership continues to take a position that we ought to withdraw even though the new policy is working
579103 if we had done what sen obama asked us to do for the last couple of years today iran and al qaeda would be in control of iraq it would be a terrible defeat for us and our allies in the middle east and throughout the world
579104 beyond a loyalty to americas ideals beyond a willingness to dissent on behalf of those ideals i also believe that patriotism must if it is to mean anything involve the willingness to sacrifice to give up something we value on behalf of a larger cause for those who have fought under the flag of this nation for the young veterans i meet when i visit walter reed for those like john mccain who have endured physical torment in service to our country no further proof of such sacrifice is necessary and let me also add that no one should ever devalue that service especially for the sake of a political campaign and that goes for supporters on both sides we must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform period full stop
579105 iraq had no legitimate reason to have posessed the yellowcake
579106 in the debate over whether america should have focused its initial response on uprooting al qaeda from southwest asia one thing should not be forgotten from its inception center of gravity has been the the middle east it was the source of its money leadership ideology and manpower afghanistans importance from the beginning lay in what it could provide bin laden in terms of prestige he could parlay into into influence in saudi arabia egypt jordan syria and iraq the strategic value of land locked impoverished afghanistan to the jihad was as a symbol rather than a geopolitical prize the image of jihadis defeating the soviet army was the ultimate source of credibility something that could prise money men and political authority from their home front treasury and recruitment depot given a choice between giving up afghanistan and reprising the defeat of a superpower in iraq al qaeda would have clearly preferred the latter this does not mean that afghanistan is strategically unimportant but it was always secondary to the middle east
579107 werent there in any meaningful way prior to our invading
579108 leaving iraq in aqs sights which could only be interpreted by the world as a failure for the us and retreating to afghanistan a place of much lesser geopolitical value is quite another this was and is obamas gambit
579109 re focusing on afghanistan after iraq is under relative control
579110 a key part of this strategy should include ending the notion of a war on terrorism and replacing it with such concepts as counterterrorism which most governments with signi cant terrorist threats use terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors
579111 his strategy however departs from rumsfelds focus on preemptive military action and instead encourages current and future u s leaders to work with other countries to eliminate the conditions that foster extremism
579112 unfortunate that those on the right took the time to use gen
579113 john kerrys combination of physical courage and moral values is my definition of what we need as americans in our commander in chief
579114 if barack obama wants to question john mccains service to his country he should have the guts to do it himself and not hide behind his campaign surrogates
579115 if he expects the american people to believe his pledges about a new kind of politics barack obama has a responsibility to condemn these attacks
579116 who would you rather have in charge of the defense of the united states of america a group of people who never served a day overseas in their life or a guy who served his country honorably and has three purple hearts and a silver star on the battlefields of vietnam
579117 no one should ever devalue military service especially for the sake of a political campaign
579118 mccain was a fighter pilot who dropped laser guided missiles from 35 000 feet he was long gone when they hit
579119 what happened when they the missiles get to the ground he doesnt know you have to care about the lives of people mccain never gets into those issues
579120 everything is looked at from his life experiences from always having been in the military and i think that can be pretty dangerous
579121 its one thing to have been drafted and served but another thing when you come from generations of military people and thats just how youre steeped how youve learned how youve grown up
579122 but now mccain is running for a higher office hes running for commander in chief and our constitution says that should be a civilian
579123 and in some ways i think it would be nice if that commander in chief had some military background but i dont know if they need a whole lot
579124 were treated like royalty they were privileged people they were given a silver spoon their careers were prepared for them
579125 john mccain has proven that he has been wrong about every judgment hes made about the war
579126 i also believe that patriotism must if it is to mean anything involve the willingness to sacrifice to give up something we value on behalf of a larger cause for those who have fought under the flag of this nation for the young veterans i meet when i visit walter reed for those like john mccain who have endured physical torment in service to our country no further proof of such sacrifice is necessary and let me also add that no one should ever devalue that service especially for the sake of a political campaign and that goes for supporters on both sides we must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform period indeed one of the good things to emerge from the current conflict in iraq has been the widespread recognition that whether you support this war or oppose it the sacrifice of our troops is always worthy of honor
579127 youve got young people who are coming here 21 22 24 years old if you go to walter reed you see young men and women of the same age who lost a limb or lost their sight
579128 what we are asking of them is profound and that means that as commander in chief it is absolutely my obligation to get it right to get the decisions as accurate as possible based on the best facts available and to clear away the politics and to clear away the ideology and the preassumptions but to also recognize that these service members take such extraordinary pride in their work
579129 regardless of these legitimate differences strategic differences between myself and john mccain or george bush or anybody else we are absolutely united in being proud of them and understanding that given their sacrifices we better fulfill our duties at least as well as theyre fulfilling theirs
579130 he does not believe that there will be nationalization of banco de venezuela
579131 the announcement is part of the destruction of the private sector of venezuela
579132 from now on the private banking sector is against the wall with this decision you create uncertainty because why invest if the state can come and take it all
579133 with this the plan of having banks that sell the structured notes and have losses capitalize their institution collapses because this purchase is seen as the beginning of a plan that may nationalize the whole banking sector

579153 vanwege mij ha ha ha ik heb heel veel moeite en energie in die winkel gestoken jarenlang ik heb er alles bij elkaar 14 jaar gewerkt in die tijd deed ik echt mijn huiswerk we verkochten de releases van vrijwel alle belangrijke europese electronische labels ik heb heel wat de britse platenlabels op de kaart gezet in detroit
579154 beslist toen ik die plaat zag dacht ik gelijk wow it stole mine too bij mij pakte technologie mijn baan af mijn boterham
579155 ik was vroeger nogal een perfectionist bovendien werk ik langzaam en had ik lange tijd niet de kennis van of de beschikking over de juiste instrumenten laat staan een eigen studio bovendien hielp het werken in een platenzaak ook niet mee aan mijn zelfvertrouwen ik hoorde natuurlijk dag in dag uit fantastische producties onbewust leg je je eigen platen langs die meetlat dan is het niet snel goed dat gezegd hebbende ben ik wel trots dat mijn schaarse singles zo goed ontvangen zijn sommige worden zelfs beschouwd als klassiekers daar ben ik best trots op blijkbaar deed ik toch wat goed
579156 o man een hele lawine toen ik op tournee in berlijn was heb ik met allerlei mensen samengewerkt ik heb net een remix gedaan voor pole een single met pacou een remix voor deepchord
579157 im definitely in the hardware mensen kennen mij voornamelijk van het softwareprogramma reactor maar ik heb ook een grote liefde voor synthesizers ik werk met reactor om meer te leren over geluidssynthese maar daar kom je uiteindelijk ook weer bij de ouderwetse synthesizers uit daar kan ik inmiddels koprolletjes over maken omdat ik er zoveel kennis over verzameld heb
579158 dat is een fantastische modulaire synthesizer van buchla ik kan me dat apparaat onmogelijk veroorloven tenzij iemand me een flinke korting geeft
579159 die term mag in die door het maar door drie muzikanten gebruikt worden delano smith norm tally en mike clark
579160 dat is wellicht geleidelijk zo gegroeid het is waar dat eddie fowkles de eerste was die de term beatdown gebruikte om te omschrijven hoe de house sound uit detroit klonk maar je mag in detroit niet zeggen dat house uit die stad hetzelfde is als beatdown want beatdown wordt officieel alleen gemaakt door die drie producers die ik noemde jongens als theo parrish of moodymann maken geen beatdown als je tegen theo zou zeggen dat hij beatdown maakt dan krijg je waarschijnlijk ruzie niet omdat we niet geassocieerd willen worden met dat drietal het is gewoon niet zo
579161 er waren inderdaad twee interessante periodes in detroit allereerst was dat de periode halverwege de jaren tachtig toen er een hele hoop interessante platen uitkwamen maar veel mensen weten niet dat de periode daarvoor eigenlijk net zo interessant was toen werd het genre eigenlijk geboren het was de periode van ken collier en club luomos dat was een legendarische club waar bijvoorbeeld shari vari en direct drive live te zien waren het was een plek waar je allerlei progressieve muziek hoorde importplaten uit itali frankrijk en engeland dingen als doctors cats feel the drive die plaat was huge in detroit
579162 zeg jij het maar ben je het daar mee eens producers in detroit houden zich daarmee helemaal niet bezig die maken gewoon muziek maar als iemand in nederland vindt dat er in detroit geen innovatieve muziek meer wordt gemaakt dan is dat natuurlijk prima
579163 toen ik samen met rick wade platen maakte voor harmonie park was ik stomverbaasd toen ik ineens allerlei positieve reacties uit europa kreeg ik had er helemaal niet bij stilgestaan dat er aan de andere kant van de oceaan mensen zouden zijn die mijn muziek cool zouden vinden ik wist alleen dat ik het cool vond
579164 right now berlin is running things dat is op dit moment de hipste plek op de planeet
579165 nee maar wijs mij de plek aan waar op dit moment wel goede house wordt gemaakt dat lukt je niet er zijn wel goede producers maar die wonen overal ter wereld
579166 wellicht in ieder geval kun je platen herkennen die uit duitsland komen het duitse geluid is heel erg gebaseerd op abbleton het grote gebrek van dat digitale geluid is het gebrek aan warmte mensen zouden er zelfs voor moeten worden gewaarschuwd met disclaimerstickers ha ha nee maar serieus ik mis de warmte in de muziek ik zal je vertellen ik ga binnenkort investeren in buizenversterkers en will mijn komende platen op reel to reel recorders op gaan nemen
579167 im from rockland county um its like outside the city like 40 minutes so its not too bad no im commuting i take the train and then the subway i went to cornell oh thank you yeah its a nice school history a b a well i didnt have any journalism expeirence so i decided to go to journalism school type ab yeah its pretty good
579168 peter luister jongen je bent te goed voor deze wereld ik kan niet aan jou tippen ja natuurlijk jij bent mijn idool en voorbeeld maar wees nou eerlijk youp gaat over mij en niet over jou ik zou totaal in het niet vallen als jij in mijn blad voor zou komen dat kunnen we niet laten gebeuren en wie kent jou nu eenmaal op hyves heb je maar 11 vrienden ik heb er tenminste 209 en dat aantal groeit per dag voor wie doe ik het dan nee echt geloof me dit is beter zo voor jou maar vooral voor mij

579263 aku takut jika kutanamkan akarku ke dalam tanah ini aku tak tahu apa yang akan kutemui di bawah sana bukankah disana sangat gelap dan jika kuteroboskan tunasku keatas bukankah nanti keindahan tunas tunasku akan hilang tunasku ini pasti akan terkoyak apa yang akan terjadi jika tunasku terbuka dan siput siput mencoba untuk memakannya dan pasti jika aku tumbuh dan merekah semua anak kecil akan berusaha untuk mencabutku dari tanah tidak akan lebih baik jika aku menunggu sampai semuanya aman

579265 society may be lulled into a false sense of security by smooth projections of global change our synthesis of present knowledge suggests that a variety of tipping elements could reach their critical point within this century under anthropogenic man made climate change

579271 saya banyak bicara dengan orang orang di sepakbola dan mereka bilang kepada saya tentang ajax yang di tahun 1970 an memenangi piala champions dengan tim yang luarbiasa muda dan mengubah wajah sepakbola
579272 orang orang mengatakan kepada saya bahwa kami sedang menuju ke sana tapi kami membutuhkan sebuah batu loncatan yakni menjuarai sesuatu dan mengetahui bagaimana caranya menang
579273 sebelum euro 200 saya tidak tahu rasanya bagaimana menang tapi saya sekarang sudah merasakannya dan tahu apa yang harus kami lakukan anda harus merasakannya

579290 they chose the wrong way to deal with it the right way would have been through the legislature there is no program in place to appropriately distribute care to undocumented persons who are catastrophically injured and there should be but you dont stick a brain injured immigrant on a private plane and spirit him out of the country in the predawn hours
579291 that the human family may know how to respect gods design for the world and thus become ever more aware of the great gift of god which creation represents for us
579292 we discovered that in depressed individuals a signaling protein is located in specific areas of the cell membrane called lipid rafts
579293 these rafts are thick viscous almost gluey areas that either facilitate or impede communication between membrane molecules
579294 when gs alpha is caught in these lipid raft domains its ability to couple with and activate adenylyl cyclase is markedly reduced antidepressants help to move the gs alpha out of these rafts and facilitate the action of certain neurotransmitters
579295 in simple language we may be able to tell you if you are depressed and more importantly whether you are responding to the chosen antidepressant therapy

579301 the asians are in their climate their conditions their environment and they showed at the 2002 world cup when they are in their own countries how well they can perform and i think one of them will go close to getting a medal if not winning a medal
579302 im not going to show my hand too much as the serbian coach has admitted he doesnt know much about us

579305 from everything we hear about this it sounds like the federal government is marshalling all of the authorities that it has in order to bring the broadest set of charges and thats what it should be doing its a positive sign that they seem to be working with the state attorney general
579306 this is not about a few undocumented jumping the fence this is about the ongoing crimes and abuses that these people endured this will be a real showcase of what can go wrong without a real comprehensive solution to immigration
579307 a case of this nature would normally be handled by the countys attorney
579308 however the child labor issues had the county attorney hand it over to the iowa attorney general tom miller
579309 immigration issues are not our area this is about criminal charges
579310 in february source 7 told ice agents he or she observed a jewish floor supervisor duct tape the eyes of an undocumented guatemalan worker shut and hit the guatemalan with a meat hook
579311 if we had a legal immigration system that met the needs of the american economy and we get those here illegally into the system and legal then workers across the country and not just immigrants will be in a much better position to stand up to employers like agriprocessors demand better working conditions or vote with their feet by changing jobs
579312 the company continues to cooperate with the government following the recent workforce immigration enforcement action that led to the management changes the company is also conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances which led to enforcement the company can not respond to specific allegations until that investigation is complete and pending legal issues are resolved

579319 i just wanted to work a year or two save and then go back to my family but it was not to be
579320 the good lord knows i was just working and not doing anyone any harm
579321 god knows you are just doing your job to support your families and that job is to keep me from supporting mine
579322 i cannot be away from my children for so long
579323 if you want to see your children or dont want your family to starve sign here
579324 your honor you know that we are here because of the need of our families i beg that you find it in your heart to send us home before too long because we have a responsibility to our children to give them an education clothing shelter and food
579325 i appreciate the fact that you are very hard working people who have come here to do no harm and i thank you for coming to this country to work hard unfortunately you broke a law in the process and now i have the obligation to give you this sentence but i hope that the u s government has at least treated you kindly and with respect and that this time goes by quickly for you so that soon you may be reunited with your family and friends
579326 your honor i am concerned from my attorney client interviews that many of these people are clearly not guilty and yet they have no choice but to plead out
579327 you know i dont agree with any of this or with the way it is being done in fact i ruled in a previous case that to charge somebody with identity theft the person had to at least know of the real owner of the social security number but i was reverted in another district and yet upheld in a third
579328 the numbers did not match the name of the employee reported by agriprocessors this analysis would not account for the possibility that a person may have falsely used the identity of an actual persons name and ssn in my training and expertise i know it is not uncommon for aliens to purchase identity documents which include ssns that match the name assigned to the number
579329 the search revealed that a person who was assigned one of the social security numbers used by an employee of agriprocessors has reported his her identity being stolen
579330 on april 16 2008 the u s filed criminal complaints against 697 employees charging them with unlawfully using ssns in violation of title 42 usc 408 a 7 b aggravated identity theft in violation of 18 usc 1028a a 1 and or possession or use of false identity documents for purposes of employment in violation of 18 usc 1546

579334 in fy07 fiscal year 2007 ice human trafficking investigations resulted in 164 arrests and 91 convictions
579335 ice has introduced an aggressive and effective campaign to enforce immigration law within the nations interior with a top level focus on criminal aliens fugitive aliens and those who pose a threat to the safety of the american public and the stability of american communities
579336 worksite enforcement initiatives that target employers who defy immigration law and the jobs magnet that draws illegal workers across the border
579337 knowingly possessing or using false employment documents with intent to deceive
579338 ice dramatically increased penalties against employers whose hiring processes violated the law securing fines and judgments of more than 30 million
579339 these incarcerated aliens have been involved in dangerous criminal activity such as murder predatory sexual offenses narcotics trafficking alien smuggling and a host of other crimes
579340 these additional personnel move ice closer to target staffing levels
579341 in fy07 one of ices key accomplishments was the mobile continuity of operations emergency response pilot project which entails the deployment of a fleet of trailers outfitted with emergency supplies pre positioned at ice locations nationwide for ready deployment in the event of a nearby emergency situation
579342 had this effort been in place prior to 9 11 all of the hijackers who failed to maintain status would have been investigated months before the attack

579347 in fy07 as the debate over comprehensive immigration reform moved to the forefront of the national stage ice expanded upon the ongoing effort to re invent immigration enforcement for the 21st century
579348 the words in your essay are not words you would be able to understand
579349 a group of guys had taken off with sandwiches without paying
579350 i was approaching exams with the possibility of being sent to jail
579351 when we applied for admission to this university we were not required to check a somali box
579352 how do you know who is somali i can bring you a three different people from kenya somalia and ethiopia and you wont be able to tell the difference
579353 for identification purposes if a person is of african descent and speaks with a foreign accent we have to share that information
579354 i dont know how many ways to ask them to come to us
579355 we have always thought that women were immune to police harassment but this attack proved us wrong
579356 the same somali students we had been trying in vain to organize against ethnic profiling turned up to protest
579357 i expected the officer to get both sides of the story and resolve the conflict
579358 but the officer grabbed me by the shoulder and asked me to leave the library
579359 she kept on saying repeatedly dont use force on me
579360 an officer told us that it was after five oclock and the chief has a life
579361 of all the people from africa kenyans ethiopians liberians why are somalis the only ones being thrown in jail
579362 you all look the same we cant tell who did it so you have to leave
579363 we cant solve a problem unless it is reported to us
579364 public safety is an issue we keep an eye on because there are so many somalis who are victims of crime and too many somalis who are also involved in crime
579365 it is also important to recognize that weve had youth violence issues with all parts of our community
579366 we should be emphasizing foreign languages in our schools from an early age
579367 senator obama has always said that learning english is an important step for immigrants to the united states and would make it a requirement for citizenship but he also believes that learning a foreign language is an enriching experience for young people in this country
579368 shining a very clear light on senator mccain and obamas statements
579369 senator mccain one day saying something nice about immigration reform when he is speaking to latinos but the next day saying something negative
579370 the next six months defines what we may very well achieve as we head into 2009 with a new congress and a new administration
579371 every year there is a set amount of visas that are available
579372 if they dont get used they dont roll over into the future they just disappear and die state departments get backed up in processing those visas and if they dont get allocated they just die the least we can do is work on the visas that were allocated in the current system
579373 you cannot sustain that you cannot keep families separated for that long
579374 one of the few bills that have the actual opportunity of getting done this year because of bipartisan support
579375 failure of comprehensive immigration reform has caused the shift to many state and local bodies trying to intervene on the issue which we think are chaotic results
579376 instead of one set of policy to deal with immigration
579377 we have multiple county and city governments trying to deal with issue
579378 not only focusing on candidates themselves but the apparatus around candidates and local campaign offices the more and more we are able to infiltrate these campaigns with requests and demands from the community the more they see it as their demand they need to represent what they are hearing back to candidate
579379 now we have earned the ability to remove that wall piece by piece
579380 we must have comprehensive immigration reform but the american people want our borders secured first
579381 many americans with good cause didnt believe us when we said we would secure our border so we failed

579395 theres just a point where some drugs cant be switched
579396 sometimes theyre presented with situations where its difficult to fill certain prescriptions because patients simply cant afford it
579397 at the end of the day you want the patient to go home with the medication they need
579398 from that standpoint i would love to see that happen

579401 the findings demonstrate that virus activity is intensifying across the state we can expect further build up during august increasing the potential for transmission of virus to people
579402 only about 12 to 15 percent of the population that have wnv would know they have it
579403 relatively few children have been reported with severe west nile virus disease by contrast most of the deaths due to wnv during 2002 were among people over 50 years old half of those deaths were among people over 77 years old
579404 but black people and hispanic people just have no values
579405 over time many many successful companies have failed to take important risks at critical points and they have paid a price some have merely stumbled and found later redemption but quite a few have not only fallen but disappeared in the 1980s alone 230 companies disappeared from the fortune 500 in fact only 16 of the 100 largest companies that were around in the early 1900s are still with us
579406 in business you can make a good argument for mistakes like steve jobs lisa or power maccube because the highly creative apple environment that spawned them also produced big winners like ipod and iphone
579407 as peter drucker pointed out nearly fifty years agao it is managements major task to prudently risk a companys present assets in order to ensure its future existence in fact if a company never has a failure i submit that their management is probably not discontented enough to justify their salaries

579420 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
579421 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
579422 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
579423 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
579424 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
579425 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
579426 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
579427 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
579428 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic

579443 there are some after races where i like how intense i look
579444 i can see the picture and just replay everything that was going through my head at that moment
579445 i think it was then that i realized you cant get caught up on one thing you just have to keep going
579446 it probably was a blessing in disguise for us to have to move out of here
579447 there will be people on the porch who saw him but they look away
579448 the people here you could tell some of them are bad but they respected me i guess
579449 to the best we can discern there has not been any qualified management on the site for three months
579450 tenants said the last person was a lady that came by to collect cash only payments
579451 that translates not only into workers for the houston metro market but it is also an attraction for employers to locate here
579452 while no economy is bulletproof we in harris county and fort bend county can be grateful that we at least appear to be bullet resistant
579453 also oftentimes we may be at capacity for certain services in the medical center
579454 it is really nice to be able to offer people a place to work and place to live that is not so far away
579455 and that has really helped our recruiting over the last two or three years in attracting people here
579456 houston and harris county are such huge economic engines if they werent there we wouldnt be here
579457 fort bend county is no longer a bedroom community you are beginning to develop an economy of your own
579458 if you look at congestion times we are still favorable for a big city
579459 we think more companies will look to locate closer to the work force rather than making the work force travel to them
579460 i think that bodes well for us in the future
579461 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
579462 across the spectrum of biothreats we have expanded our capacity significantly

579466 in mexico aids patients face two deaths one physical one social
579467 its a terrible shame that despite having medicine to detain the physical death in mexico and many parts of the world we must still endure a social death
579468 in mexico not all men who have sex with men consider themselves gay so they arent being reached by gay outreach organizations
579469 there is a whole cultural identity and stigma around the disease
579470 hiv and aids reproduce in a brutal way the stigmas and discrimination that are already present in mexican society
579471 and the doctor sent me away saying i was faking it
579472 but i knew if i was rude theyd even be less likely to help me
579473 im fighting for all the patients because this could happen to them tomorrow
579474 for the government and the decision makers were the scum of society
579475 so to spend money on us brings them little political benefit
579476 and that if you let it grow there will be a huge cost for the country
579477 the problem with reducing the number of fuels is how do you do it
579478 a more uniform national spec would definitely help utilize the existing infrastructure a lot more efficiently
579479 theres a reason why californians pay a lot more for gasoline than the rest of the nation
579480 there was this perception that the phoenix market was going to run out of fuel and so you had price spikes and complaints of retailers gouging the public
579481 even during the hurricanes there was never a shortage of that kind of fuel
579482 this year its been all about the crude oil price rise
579483 a convenience store is a convenient target for the bad guys
579484 theres cash handy its open late its easy to get in and out so we have to make it difficult
579485 the ultimate goal of this ordinance is to make the convenience stores safe for the employees that work there and safe for the communities that shop there
579486 everybody thinks outside this country that america is a very rich place
579487 my one cousin came here very new from pakistan and one day i brought him here
579488 whats the problem i get one one one little bitty can
579489 i say ok ok and he takes the money and runs very fast
579490 before when i started this job i was very afraid but now you know im used to it
579491 you feel secure behind the glass but then you wonder why do you need all this
579492 its the land of opportunity and the first thing you have to be in a cage
579493 if the robber kills this one guy then its like killing the whole family
579494 the same day even he told me i dont want to work over here its very risky he was trying to get a job at a hotel
579495 in my opinion i dont think theres anything to worry about
579496 we are doing some computer modeling to see what might have caused these low readings
579497 paine who is the main person doing the testing told us he would have no problem with any of his five children walking down 770 and going to our school and hes the expert
579498 and they promised to assist with emergency funding if there was a problem and we had to relocate
579499 but we will need more information than this to make plans for our future
579500 the commission felt everything is ok but they cant guarantee it everybody is saying this is just the best information they have but we want more
579501 the main thing is that we have to determine that all is well and safe in the town so that we can get along with our everyday life
579502 we want more information than they are giving us we want to know what these gravity lows really are
579503 as long as things are being monitored there should not be any danger
579504 all he has to do is call me and say he is all right and we wouldnt have to hound him like a fugitive
579505 ill go home and redo it in my head re create it think about the family members
579506 you definitely carry it home with you to make sure youre not missing anything
579507 there are so many cases where the circumstances leave you scratching your head
579508 one thing ive noticed with what we do is you dont want to box yourself in
579509 it seems like most of them are men and they just want to be with a different family or have a completely different lifestyle
579510 matthew as smart as he is if he doesnt want to be found itll take a genius to find him
579511 like in the movie the guy left and didnt tell his parents or anybody what he was doing and they were just beside themselves
579512 law enforcement is really limited as to what we can actually do
579513 there is nothing to keep you from walking away from your home and meeting new friends and starting a new career
579514 hes either in witness protection or down in mexico on the beach soaking up rays and drinking margaritas
579515 it is hard not to care for her shes been such a delightful person
579516 she got here and was comfortable and adopted a new way of life
579517 he started getting sick he never did get back up after she left
579518 id like to see some way we havent thought of to help him
579519 as far as the minor leagues i dont know what were allowed to do
579520 it doesnt really work unless the player is going to buy into it
579521 its something ill have to talk over with joe to see what his thoughts are see what our hitting coaches thoughts are see what andruws thoughts are
579522 its a matter of time we all know that the skills are there hes got to get that consistency back when he does im sure andruw will be back in center field
579523 be the biggest loss of my career to right now
579524 it is a different burden for me i can tell you i have two careers most players dont have that experience you play here for the professional league the nba the best league in the world if you win titles in this league that would be wonderful
579525 being in the olympics is a national honor its a dream i have when i am young it is obligation and an expectation that i have from my homeland the whole country is focused on these games in beijing basketball is a big game in china
579526 i would say i am about 60 to 70 percent and that is frustrating i am sure now that i will play in the olympics
579527 but i wont be in my best shape i know that and that is disappointing
579528 this is about different cultures different backgrounds and bringing all people different ways of thinking about things
579529 i cant say that any side is wrong americans say the rockets pay my salary no problem i like the rockets whatever uniform i wear i play 100 percent
579530 for china they have to understand that my loyalty to my country will never change but now i have another group of people in america that i need to take care of these people the chinese fans and american fans are not connected they do not understand how each other think i am the one who is connected i am in the middle that is the important goal of the olympics to bring different people together
579531 obviously a medal is always a dream when youre playing in the olympics
579532 youre standing there and you have a medal it doesnt matter what color you have but to be honest we are not at that level yet especially with the injuries to me and to yi jianlian i am not sure of our fitness we can make some history if we get into the 7th or 6th spot but i think 8th is about where we are
579533 if we win that first game i would quit right away i would say im getting out of here im not playing basketball anymore if we beat usa in game 1 that would be the top i can do no more
579534 i was a very young player and got my first taste of the olympics in 2000 at sydney i played in athens in 2004 and now this is my home country and the highest special honor in 2008 enough i think why would i need to play in london in 2012
579535 my parents do not talk about this but it is a story i have heard from people who are friends of my parents
579536 when my mom lost her chance to play in the olympics instead she had me that year if she had played in the olympics i would probably be two years younger now or maybe not born at all
579537 the first time i really watched the olympics and understood was 1996 in atlanta at that time i was practicing with the shanghai sharks junior team i remember waking up at 3 a m to watch china play argentina on tv we won that game and my parents told me it was a big big event wang zhi zhi played in that game and played well at that time i thought one day i could play in the olympics
579538 when you have the flag in your hand you feel like you have a whole country of people in your grasp and of course you feel the expectation it is the pressure that i have continued to feel every day since i came to the nba and now going back home for the olympics it is such extreme focus
579539 a lot of the people who were living there and all across china were so excited earlier this year about the olympics now 2008 has brought this to us first as the year passes it is difficult to forget we cannot forget we cannot just celebrate games and the olympics when we still have this suffering from the earthquake
579540 in the last several years ive worked with the china youth development foundation
579541 they are focused on building schools for kids in poor areas giving out scholarships last summer we had a successful
579542 at that time besides the money we raised i began thinking that it would be a very good idea to have my own foundation the original plan was to wait until after the olympics to announce it and get it started i would have more time then but the earthquake hit i watched the news i felt so sad i felt helpless in a way and i knew i had to do something right away i can do something to help
579543 there are a lot of different ways to think about things there are republicans and democrats in america there are different parties everywhere many different ideas
579544 but if you are not going then you lost a chance to tell people what you think and we have lost a chance to communicate with you
579545 i think back to when they started the modern olympics in athens in 1896 it was a beautiful idea to put people together again to make friendship and share the honor and share everything
579546 they stopped wars for the olympics they laid down their arms for the games right now war looks like a part of our life in this world but hopefully no wars no bombs no gunshots in those three weeks of the olympics maybe it is a dream it is my wish
579547 were caught in the middle between traditional culture and archaeological research and the valid existing rights of the oil and gas leaseholders
579548 not to be absolutely certain is i think one of the essential things in rationality
579549 we made enough progress on most of the major issues to give the negotiators confidence to continue talking through the night without a strike
579550 there are still sticking points but theyre confident they can reach an agreement
579551 whether you think you can or whether you think you cant youre right
579552 he does a wonderful job of taking one day at a time and attacking whatever is in front of him
579553 if they gave black belts for handling pressure hes about a sixth degree black belt
579554 ive been around him when people come up and hes at the genius level when dealing with people he has been in pressure situations so much he has been desensitized to a point
579555 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
579556 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
579557 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
579558 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
579559 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
579560 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
579561 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
579562 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
579563 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
579564 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
579565 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
579566 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
579567 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
579568 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
579569 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
579570 an instinctive dread of and hatred for nuclear weapons is one of the most fundamental roots of japans non nuclear stance
579571 the biggest worry is that the us and china might develop a
579572 if international tension is intensified japan should possess nuclear weapons
579573 i believe that japan wont go nuclear that will be a huge mistake but the notion that japan will never go nuclear is wrong
579574 saya nggak mau banyak janji yang tidak bisa dihadirkan kebanyakan janji bisa masuk angin
579575 sudah saatnya rakyat harus bisa memikirkan memilih pemimpin sesuai dengan keyakinan bukan karena kharisma si pemimpin
579576 pengalaman kami selama 10 tahun membuktikan anak yang disuruh menggambar apel dan hasil gambarnya kecil biasanya tidak percaya diri apalagi kalau tangan dan pensilnya tidak diangkat saat menggambar
579577 setiap orang itu lahir dengan tujuh kemampuan dasar salah satunya menggambar biasanya yang paling dihormati memang dua kemampuan yaitu logika dan linguistik bahasa tapi kita berpikir itu sesuai gambar lho base on otak kita itu gambar misalkan jika ditanya apa buah kesayangan kita kita pasti membayangkan dulu bukan tulisannya dulu kan
579578 losing your home does take your pride we had a thriving business and we didnt have to worry about anything
579579 it sold but it sold real low so we still have got that amount difference to pay people dont understand that
579580 they told us to call in the family because they didnt think hed make it but god intervened
579581 he never had surgery because the doctors said he would still be in a lot of pain or end up in a wheelchair we just prayed about it and depended on god
579582 his customers were great they kept telling us they would wait until he got better but there was no getting better
579583 we started selling out selling our antique furniture when that went we started selling the tools and stuff from the business i tried to start doing upholstery in the home but they wanted him
579584 it gradually went sour because we just couldnt keep up with what we had going you just keep getting behind and getting behind you cant get out once you get behind every month we were in the minus
579585 but you have choices you either eat get your lights paid and pay your water bill or pay your mortgage
579586 i dont know why they dont work with people to stay rather than let it set empty
579587 they utilities say theres help out there but just try to get it
579588 you didnt know if one day somebody would just show up and tell you to get out i asked at the bank and they said they couldnt tell you nothing
579589 but our family had been checking on us and they offered us this place to move into
579590 we still do without a lot it gets to you but you know there are people suffering more than you are
579591 the central flyway will not be included in the canvasback and scaup changes to allow for the completion of the hunters choice experiment
579592 coming from angleton playing one year in high school walking on at bishop college going to kansas city as a free agent to play in this league to have success and then get a chance to be in the hall of fame is beyond belief im still overwhelmed
579593 i never had any leg trouble or groins or twisted muscles
579594 when they finally gave me that number i thought maybe i had a shot
579595 im the oldest of the group i had to wait the longest but i feel just as good about the nomination
579596 i just figured he drank it wow thats pretty cool to know he waited until that moment
579597 zims a tremendous man hes what people should stand for he was just a joy to be around
579598 about a month before he was born i changed his name from darrell jr to jared
579599 i felt like god told me to do it im so grateful because hes his own man
579600 i was definitely right by doing that because hes not little darrell green
579601 as proud as i am about being in the hall of fame im more proud that hes my son
579602 i love coming here and ill try to come back every year
579603 as long as i can take a breath ill be back
579604 mike sent me up there oregon to try to talk him into coming back but i couldnt do it
579605 i wish i could have played five more years but my body just told me it was time
579606 i had gotten to the point where i ran out of spare parts
579607 when he bowlen called i told him if i came back id just be stealing a paycheck so i decided to take the high road and leave with the great memory of winning the super bowl
579608 id like to give as much time as possible within reason for him to continue to demonstrate that hes going to do things the way we expect him to
579609 im kind of counting on him being here for the first game but its up to the commissioner
579610 its not all about the money anymore ive been doing this for nine years now and its about accomplishing the long term goals i set when i first came into this league
579611 its about trying to establish my name long after im gone playing on the team that jim brown played on and the legacy that he established here as a running back thats a challenge within itself thats who i try to come out here and please and i know hes out here watching
579612 i know at this point last year i had no clue
579613 this year i feel like i do i have a command of the offense
579614 a guy like him getting hurt its part of football unfortunately and theres not a play that you dont hold your breath in all honesty
579615 youve just got to keep pushing through and hope for the best and hopefully its our time to stay healthy weve been pretty fortunate through this camp weve been pretty darn good keep our fingers crossed with him and see what happens
579616 normally when you have a pull or something you can tell when youre running by the way it feels
579617 i didnt feel anything pop or anything like that i just felt it tighten up real tight on me when i felt that i just slowed down i didnt feel a pop or anything like that afterward so like i said im fine ill get treatment for a few days and ill be fine
579618 to be honest with you hes not in the shape the rest of our football team is and we found that out real fast
579619 he got gassed the first night he was out here he got gassed earlier today and hes not up with our team unfortunately thats what happens when you bring guys in the middle of camp if theyre not in excellent shape they get exposed in a way very very quick i just dont think he was in very good condition
579620 what we have to do is weve got to prepare that if we suit seven who are those seven
579621 for the players when you walk in camp its a long time before you actually get to walk into a stadium and play but now there is a little light at the end of the tunnel each week
579622 we just hope we get a few of these kids back next week and get healthy and get ready to play next weekend
579623 i have to have him next to me he keeps me grounded morlon he makes this thing work hes the brainiac on the defense he knows where everybody is supposed to be and he knows all the calls
579624 if im messing something up he corrects me real quick thats my guy i have to have hes my sidekick i have to have him next to me
579625 hes also a smart player so dont let him tell you im the brainiac
579626 to this day ive never witnessed a club atmosphere in america better than that one
579627 there were no gimmicks no giveaways it was just fans that wanted to see the houston dynamo advance to the final i still get chills talking about it
579628 i remember sitting back and saying to assistant coach john spencer this is incredible you wish there was another word to describe it awesome memorable theres no word that quite does it that for me was the most incredible 30 seconds of witnessing a crowd it was like soccer had definitely arrived
579629 it seems like weve had a lot of important moments in a short period of time
579630 i think the way the guys stuck together that first season was pretty incredible
579631 one thing that did help us was that guys were new here and had no one to hang out with
579632 i replay that one at certain moments of the year
579633 i walked in and was hit by a wave of emotion
579634 anyone with half an eye on houston sports news knows that this just went down last week as ron artest brought his 20 points per game to join yaos 22 and tracy mcgradys 22 and try to bring life to the successful but stagnant rockets
579635 it was the biggest one year improvement in rockets team history
579636 it was an exciting game they were base hits big plays and big moments all around
579637 you have to find a way to stay under control and not do too much
579638 it was great base running because thats not a normal sac fly ball for it to end like that is very interesting and strange
579639 weve had a few wins this year where weve pulled ourselves out of the fire but tonight was one of the better wins we had against a tough closer and one of the best starters in the game johan santana
579640 it wasnt a good feeling for a few seconds i got hit both ways i hit my thigh on the catcher and pence ran up my back it was a little whiplash but well worth it
579641 i was a little aggressive and it just so happened we were side by side as were coming into home
579642 i felt a little stronger than i was last start
579643 it takes me a little bit to get going but after i got going it was pretty good with santana out there i thought i might have given up too many runs
579644 you have to give most of the credit not necessarily to the bullpen but to the offense
579645 theyre battling against one of the top starters and top closers in the game
579646 we pulled out a win and all we had to do is to keep is close
579647 if we can have peace for 16 days then maybe we can have it forever
579648 the world today is a difficult place to live in
579649 there are many conflicts between nations and there are civil wars within a single nation but there is an exception the exception is the olympic village
579650 be the biggest loss of my career to right now
579651 it is a different burden for me i can tell you i have two careers most players dont have that experience you play here for the professional league the nba the best league in the world if you win titles in this league that would be wonderful
579652 being in the olympics is a national honor its a dream i have when i am young it is obligation and an expectation that i have from my homeland the whole country is focused on these games in beijing basketball is a big game in china
579653 i would say i am about 60 to 70 percent and that is frustrating i am sure now that i will play in the olympics
579654 but i wont be in my best shape i know that and that is disappointing
579655 this is about different cultures different backgrounds and bringing all people different ways of thinking about things
579656 i cant say that any side is wrong americans say the rockets pay my salary no problem i like the rockets whatever uniform i wear i play 100 percent
579657 for china they have to understand that my loyalty to my country will never change but now i have another group of people in america that i need to take care of these people the chinese fans and american fans are not connected they do not understand how each other think i am the one who is connected i am in the middle that is the important goal of the olympics to bring different people together
579658 obviously a medal is always a dream when youre playing in the olympics

579674 are aliens really a threat to our national security why is seti receiving money that is supposed to be used for national defense
579675 if youve got money and you can influence things in washington you get benefits if you dont have money and you cant influence youre not necessarily benefiting
579676 look at the omnibus package in the senate right now
579677 theyve rolled 35 bills into one with over 10 billion in spending stuffed into it with the federal government facing a record 490 billion budget deficit in 2009 maybe congress should consider how it will balance the federal budget before it goes running up more credit card bills that taxpayers get stuck with

579689 two years ago was a horrible election for republicans in a horrible environment the environment is now worse for republicans than it was two years ago and that means the election results could be as bad or even worse
579690 tra il dire e il fare c e il mare
579691 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everybody elses business or their personal lives its inappropriate
579692 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
579693 no one is more supportive of gay rights than i am
579694 both parties are talking the green bay packers and brett
579695 and i think the discussions are moving ahead i would hope that we would have something resolved by monday
579696 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
579697 primarily it starts with the fact does brett want to play football
579698 the second is do the packers want him to play for the packers those are the two principal points that have to be resolved and only two parties can make that determination not me
579699 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
579700 im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
579701 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
579702 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving
579703 today was our first bump in the road in terms of having too many negative things happen in practice and i think thats a credit to their focus and their energy level and staying true to its training camp
579704 everybody is going through it and theyve done a really good job no one is really talking about it frankly
579705 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical
579706 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
579707 for someone whos been in washington nearly 30 years hes got a pretty slim record on education and when he has taken a stand its been the wrong one
579708 im happy to put my record and ideas up against his any day
579709 im not really sure what happened but thats a done issue thats something that obviously people hear stuff im here practicing waiting and i obviously cant wait till the season starts
579710 im in a great frame of mind why wouldnt i be im with a new team a great bunch of guys im looking forward to getting this season on the road and actually looking forward to going into next week and try to put everything together as a team and as an offense
579711 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
579712 javon walker reportedly told the team he wanted to retire and offered to return his 11 million signing bonus
579713 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
579714 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
579715 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
579716 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
579717 probably leave rates unchanged and give a no bias statement
579718 we expect the ecb to be on hold for at least the next 12 months
579719 to the mounting evidence that the eurozone economic downturn is deepening
579720 the ecb will no longer describe the economic fundamentals as sound
579721 we expect the risk of a much sharper downturn in the labour market to keep the ecb on hold despite the current inflation overshoot
579722 we wouldnt say it very loud but there may be fair chances that julys 4 1 percent may have been the peak in inflation
579723 the eurozone economy is heading toward a stagnation phase bound to last at best a few months
579724 probably state that it is too early to deem as entrenched the recent downward movement in oil prices
579725 money statistics will be a key signal for the rate outlook

579727 we will expel all the persons of the south side staying in the mt kumgang tourist area we deem unnecessary

579733 the church is wrong we can help these people they cannot we are living in the 21st century not the dark ages
579734 ask people if her age and gender were factors and theyll say of course not
579735 hes going to have to try very hard to manage that issue and overcome peoples expectations that hes lost a step
579736 what this suggests is that women are under more pressure to get to the top fast men have four additional years before people to expect them to reach their peak performance as leaders but women have to prove themselves more quickly the climb is steeper for them
579737 it doesnt mean plastic surgery is going to be effective in changing expectations for leaders but it does explain why people seek it its not just vanity age can affect your career and probably more so for women than men
579738 in terms of the election it was right for clinton to emphasize her credentials and experience that helped her what she and her campaign didnt expect was that obamas lack of experience would not be a deficit obama has very little experience but it didnt seem to matter lack of experience for a woman however would likely eliminate her from contention
579739 age is a complicated status characteristic supervisors are seen as gaining value up to a certain age but that prestige and influence seems to reach a maximum at some point and experience cuts both ways the only way to get a lot of experience is to get older so experience is good as long as you dont get too old doing it
579740 kate was way too desperate a woman who clearly cant be on her own without a man in her life at all times
579741 she has no talent im sure paris would tell you that herself
579742 shes got a look that a lot of younger girls liked and copied hilton managed to gain fame because the timing was right for her
579743 a lot of younger women looked up to her shes a very sweet nice girl but thats it then you put a full stop its over so id say paris is infamous
579744 its a dumb thing to say i dont think that makes paris and me similar i dont go to clubs i dont party i dont dance on tables and i dont like sex tapes
579745 the number one use would be biopsy the other would be control of bleeding if you could cauterize or laser a source of bleeding that would be a major therapeutic use

579756 the judiciary wishes to state that upon the invitation of the executive as part of a process of consultation it had embarked upon regarding constitutional reform the honourable the chief justice and a small committee of judges nominated by him held a singular meeting recently with the honourable the attorney general and two members of a sub committee appointed by the government
579757 this meeting could hardly be described as secret as suggested by the media on friday since it was held in the hall of justice under all protocols normal to the periodic exchanges in which the honourable the chief justice becomes engaged in the course of his duties
579758 i dont know how to describe this feeling it is out of this world
579759 part of my mind told me that i was going to win but i still cant believe it although i wanted it to happen
579760 im proud im excited im overwhelmed i am blessed she erica is blessed i thank god most of all for allowing her to reach this far thanks to trinidad and tobago for the support and thanks to the judges for all the advice they gave her which she took seriously and it worked for her
579761 oh uh nononno no no no nono nonono no no no
579762 whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa no no no no hey hey stop
579763 it is only half the truth to say that our young people are the future our young people are equally the present how we engage our young people today will determine if they are around to be the future and the quality of future they will inherit
579764 ive spent a lot of time in deep meditation and when i hear the cries of people who wanted their money back yes im sorry
579765 imagine trying to explain to a 68 year old woman about a run against the institution
579766 no i am not sorry when it comes to the business my hands are clean and at all times my directors and myself acted responsibly and they can lock me up if you find i own one share of any company using hcu deposits he said

579770 mr president you have to put it to the house this is a violation
579771 in order to give you those toys we would have to cut down severely on water supplies health centres technical schools roads etc it is not possible to make a good development plan if the prime minister insists on inserting 18 million of his own pet schemes of a sort which neither develop the country nor increase the comfort of the people
579772 the advice you have given me sound though it may be is essentially from the economic point of view i have told you on many occasions that i cannot always follow this advice as i am a politician and must gamble on the future
579773 seek ye first the political kingdom and all else would be added unto ye
579774 there is a limit to what one can take and i get tired of sticking around just to play nursemaid to grown men finally the political atmosphere gets me down the fascist state is in full process of creation if one cannot like and respect the people one works with smiles with and stands to attention for ones spirit must drop sooner or later
579775 anyone who stands in their way was a traitor to heavens cause they were acting like egyptian pharaohs and were finding that this was a lifetimes chance to make a fortune

579777 some persons still fall short of the requirements to qualify
579778 to do our best to locate them in units that will not stretch them financially
579779 we will hand over around 4 000 5 000 units by september
579780 unfortunately these are perceptions we do our best to address through public education and information
579781 additionally the ministry is currently in a process of reviewing the allocations policy for transparency and fairness fairness to ensure age of application gets heavier weight and transparent to allow for a public draw to open up the process to the public other measures for transparency are under consideration
579782 it goes against the governments policy and transfers thousands of dollars in funds in subsidy to a non emergency case
579783 the only non random allocation should be done with the approval of the minister
579784 they started midway through my career so i havent given them the priority like i do a major or care about like a major
579785 but they are always the best fields in the game theyre always on great golf courses theyre always on tough tests so i think theres a lot of merit to whoever wins those
579786 whilst ernst and young stated 72 cents on the dollar was
579787 we believe that the assets are worth more than 545m we could be wrong but we are entitled to our estimate based on the information we have
579788 having a second opinion is common business practice but some seem to have a problem with this
579789 all we are saying is let us have a second opinion by someone in whom we have full trust and confidence and who is selected by us the hcudsg
579790 none of these requests challenges the action by the commissioner of cooperatives or the provisional liquidator we are simply trying to have normal business resumed at hcu especially to collect payments on the loan portfolio and generate income from the subsidiary companies
579791 hcudsg warns all those who have loans to the hcu that you should not be lured into thinking that these loans will be written off because of the current situation every effort will be made to recover every dollar of our members assets thus ensuring maximum return of our members investments
579792 thats one of the reasons why we expect more than 72 cents on the dollar
579793 i am concerned with the loss of life in various ways with the loss of property with the attack on private citizens on the business and the general economy of the country with our image as police officers and the international views of us that are expressed
579794 to understand where they are and to encourage them to do what must be done to bring this entire situation to something which is tolerable
579795 however even as one accepts that trinidad and tobago has come to this necessary military pass caution is advised lest the rigours of the law are allowed to be washed away in the current sea of blood moreover the historical evidence is that ours is a society in which the very best intentions run aground on the shores of official incompetence born of an unwillingness by government to take the population into its confidence preferring always to do things on the sly and from on high the lack of transparency attending the richplain exercise being the latest case in point
579796 i know a lot of these people and most of them in any other circumstance would be happy to vote for a black person im serious they are very liberal on race and across the whole range of social issues
579797 this hilary clinton was one of their own and they felt about her the same way that african americans feel about senator obama they dont really have any animosity towards obama its just that there were so many hopes built up and it would have been the same way with african americans if senator obama had not been successful you would have had this same kind of emotion
579798 is not a certainty if somebody were to give me 1 000 i would bet on obama
579799 there are so many new people in the electorate not just college students and those just out of college but so many people under 35 years who are so attracted to him he is tremendously popular among young white people
579800 thats a whole lot of age and it points to a whole different life experience television verus the internet cold war verus globalism segregration verus a multiracial society and those are things that affect not only the minds of these two candidates but the minds of millions of americans it just seems that the way the world is moving is in barack obamas favour
579801 there are some white people who would say yeh ill vote for a black person
579802 and when they get into the polling booth all the memories and recollections come down and it is impossible to predict how prevalent that would be in this election
579803 towards the end of the primaries when senator clinton carried pennsylvania ohio texas west virginia and kentucky some people said those were old white people who wouldnt vote for a black person
579804 nevertheless i think a lot of these people will vote for senator obama but whether it is 20 per cent 50 per cent or higher i dont know it would take a very sophisticated psychologist to determine that
579805 and those jobs have moved to the other countries the caribbean south east asia
579806 when we look at our wage scales our environmental standards our working conditions and compare it with other countries where it is much lower they can produce goods cheaper and in that sense it is not fair trade
579807 that will give the us people and government a much more friendly level of involvement and participation in the caribbean than has been the case in recent times
579808 based upon information obtained as recently as today august 1 she accepts the fact that the testing was properly done and the results properly reported
579809 she sadly accepts the fact that this necessarily means she will not be able to compete in the upcoming olympics in beijing and faces a possible two year suspension of eligibility
579810 jessica is heartbroken at this turn of events as making the us olympic team was her cherished dream and proudest moment she intends to resume her swimming career as soon as possible and to again fulfill her olympic dream in 2012
579811 rebecca soni will swim the 100m breaststroke and kara lynn joyce will swim the 50m freestyle
579812 we are going to seek to have her suspension reduced and reserve the right to bring that issue to arbitration
579813 working expediently and agreeably to resolve the situation with as little impact to the us olympic team as possible
579814 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
579815 it was him who saw mr alfredo reinado taking weapons from the guards
579816 he then woke up two soldiers who were still sleeping in another area of the land of the house then one of them woke up rushed to behind the house saw alfredo and aimed the gun at him so this boy was really a hero
579817 the fact that i turned is what saved me because if i had not turned quick i would have been hit on the chest
579818 yes he did lose touch its amazing how the five years you know can make a huge difference
579819 that i think is partly because as president he didnt travel enough in the country
579820 weve taken this decision to retire because our competitive and private lives became impossible after the media scandal erupted
579821 the democrats have nominated a man who is a mere fad or meme win or lose they will have a horrible case of buyers remorse
579822 i just want to say that everything has been resolved and i will be back out to work on tuesday

579832 everybody asking me about this new reggae song they say i did i do have a couple of reggae albums but i have not recently recorded any reggae songs i have not even heard the song myself but maybe its one of my old reggae songs that they found
579833 i will find the song and listen to it because its interesting to learn that someone sounds so much like you
579834 i internalise things a lot and i do not write about fiction but of what i live and see happening around me
579835 we are still struggling like that today so the song maintains its relevance it is easy to get into violence when you are young because you are vibrant and seeking after what you perceive to be the good things of life i began singing professionally about two years after leaving school and after being a part of two groups decided that i wanted to go into a certain direction with my music and so am now on my own

579840 you read the bible every day whoa theres a program for things like that maybe you should consider checking it out sunday should be enough for you and its actually okay to take a rest from god
579841 if we say that we have no sin we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us
579842 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
579843 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us these sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
579844 salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved

579898 by utilizing available technology we are able to reach out to an entirely new generation of voters youtube estimates that there are more than 100 million videos being watched every day we of course only need capture a very small percentage of that viewership to be highly effective

579903 in het verslag wordt nergens vermeld hoe hoog de concentratie van die giftige stof precies was tal van vragen blijven onbeantwoord
579904 sta me dus toe dat nogal vreemd te vinden als de tegenexpertise negatief blijkt stappen we naar de rechter
579905 de vooruitzichten dat ze erdoor komt zien er niet goed uit
579906 die hebben haar een veilig onderkomen verschaft maar jammer genoeg de politie niet verwittigd
579907 na enig speurwerk kwamen we haar al gauw op het spoor
579908 not enough is done at the very top end of the tourist market
579909 everyone in bordeaux thinks people wait on bended knee for their wines but nowadays excellent wines are produced all over the world
579910 the oenotourism trend in bordeaux is more oriented towards volume agencies and hotels and restaurants catering to the very top end are harder to find
579911 in my view luxury tourism can only be tailor made for very small groups often of two people
579912 we have no limits really it is up to what people want
579913 americans are the avid wine lovers they are looking for discoveries to learn about different grapes and comparisons with californian wines they want to know the history
579914 the russians stay two or three days with a chauffeur and an interpreter and have very heavy tasting schedules
579915 there are more and more luxury clients but the competition is tough
579916 places like italy spain and portugal have made huge efforts we have lessons to learn
579917 i played the best summer hard season in my life so im very happy for that
579918 in the second set i felt well and in some moments i felt i was playing better than him finally he beat me i just congratulate him because hes playing well
579919 day after day im getting stronger in the segment of my game which is really important coming up to the final stages of the tournament
579920 rafa always gives 100 percent in every match and on any surface it was a challenge and i accepted it
579921 i feel happy because for sure i will be number one
579922 but theres to time to enjoy i have olympics in one week
579923 the world faces a global climate emergency it is now clear that only action by both developed and developing countries can prevent the climate crisis from deepening
579924 the aim is to limit global temperature increases to two degrees above pre industrial levels
579925 the time is right for the countrys private sector to show leadership by partnering with government to develop a solutions driven national climate change mitigation and adaptation response
579926 the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of mitigating the effects of climate change
579927 our emissions per capita are higher than many other developing countries south africas emissions per capita are also high due to our coal based energy system
579928 our analysis shows that putting a price on carbon has the single largest impact on emissions by using the price signal it sends signals to all actors in the economy and can shift behaviour
579929 probably leave rates unchanged and give a no bias statement
579930 we expect the ecb to be on hold for at least the next 12 months
579931 to the mounting evidence that the eurozone economic downturn is deepening
579932 the ecb will no longer describe the economic fundamentals as sound
579933 we expect the risk of a much sharper downturn in the labour market to keep the ecb on hold despite the current inflation overshoot
579934 we wouldnt say it very loud but there may be fair chances that julys 4 1 percent may have been the peak in inflation
579935 the eurozone economy is heading toward a stagnation phase bound to last at best a few months
579936 probably state that it is too early to deem as entrenched the recent downward movement in oil prices
579937 money statistics will be a key signal for the rate outlook
579938 a decisive inversion in the credit cycle may open the way to rate cuts in 2009
579939 that the ecb is holding a huge amount of toxic stuff in their balance sheets
579940 the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great
579941 that is why i have banned the import of these cats immediately
579942 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
579943 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
579944 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
579945 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
579946 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
579947 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
579948 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
579949 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
579950 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
579951 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war
