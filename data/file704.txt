7040002 almost half of all internet users now use search engines on a typical day
7040003 ubiquitous broadband has conditioned consumers to expect a more dynamic and engaging internet experience the search experience for the most part has not kept pace with the rest of the internet the days of serving up line after line of static text results are coming to an end as popularity familiarity and proficiency with internet search grows consumers will demand that search results pages have more video presentation and rich media interaction less drill down and deeper personalization theres no question internet search is long overdue for a facelift

7040034 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7040035 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7040036 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7040037 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7040038 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7040039 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7040040 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7040041 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7040042 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7040043 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7040044 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7040045 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7040046 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7040047 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7040048 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7040049 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7040050 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7040051 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7040052 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7040053 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7040054 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7040055 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7040056 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7040057 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7040058 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7040059 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7040060 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7040061 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7040062 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7040063 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7040064 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7040065 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7040066 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7040067 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7040068 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7040069 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7040070 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7040071 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7040072 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7040073 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7040074 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7040075 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7040076 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7040077 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7040078 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7040079 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7040080 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7040081 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7040082 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7040083 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7040084 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7040085 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7040086 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7040087 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7040088 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7040089 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7040090 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7040091 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7040092 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7040093 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7040094 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7040095 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7040096 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7040097 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7040098 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7040099 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7040100 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7040101 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7040102 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7040103 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7040104 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7040105 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7040106 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7040107 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7040108 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7040109 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7040110 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7040111 acho que esse produto j pegou e n o vai ser um simples modismo acredito que o acess rio deve virar um cl ssico

7040145 we carried out the suicide attack and other bombings and will continue with more attacks if the government does not halt the military operation against us
7040146 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion

7040176 giving a women under age 50 a mammogram on a routine basis is close to unethical
7040177 the premenopausal breast is highly sensitive to radiation each 1 rad exposure increasing breast cancer risk by about 1 percent with a cumulative 10 percent increased risk for each breast over a decades screening
7040178 they were conscious chosen politically expedient acts by a small group of people for the sake of their own power prestige and financial gain resulting in suffering and death for millions of women
7040179 the benefit is marginal the harm caused is substantial and the costs incurred are enormous
7040180 mammograms increase the risk for developing breast cancer and raise the risk of spreading or metastasizing an existing growth
7040181 the high sensitivity of the breast especially in young women to radiation induced cancer was known by 1970 nevertheless the establishment then screened some 300 000 women with xray dosages so high as to increase breast cancer risk by up to 20 percent in women aged 40 to 50 who were mammogramed annually
7040182 the establishment ignores safe and effective alternatives to mammography particularly trans illumination with infrared scanning

7040189 higher rates of guillain barr have been associated with the swine flu vaccine and possibly with the meningitis vaccine menactra but it is no more common in those who get gardasil than in those who dont
7040190 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children

7040193 i am painfully aware of the widespread theft of stock farm produce irrigation equipment and the general vandalism of infrastructure by our new farmers
7040194 i am disappointed that our new farmers have proved to be failures since the start of the land reform programme in 2000 in spite of all the support government has been pouring into the agricultural sector productivity and under utilisation of land remain issues of concern

7040222 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
7040223 its a signal but we dont know what it means
7040224 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
7040225 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

7040230 i am interested in whats behind all the ratings and reviews we read the level of scrutiny is not sufficient
7040231 we called the restaurant multiple times each time we reached an answering machine and a message from a person purporting to be from the restaurant claiming that it was closed at the moment
7040232 googling the restaurant turned up an actual address and located it on a map of milan the restaurant sent us a link to a website that listed its menu
7040233 this is a program that recognizes the efforts restaurants put into their wine lists
7040234 this gets down to what the wine spectator is all about its not exactly wine for dummies its more wine for the gullible
7040235 this gives the appearance of paying for advertising disguised as a contest

7040238 in my opinion the science class is where to teach evolution or if there are other scientific thoughts that need to be discussed
7040239 if were going to talk about more philosophical matters like why it was created and was there an intelligent designer behind it thats for the religion class or philosophy class or social studies class
7040240 i believe that god designed the universe and created the universe and i believe evolution is most likely the process he used to create the human body
7040241 as a person i am defined by my commitment to christ and people always say well there is an official role and there is but i dont think people in public life should shy away from sharing their faith perspective because it informs others about their value system and what they believe and who they are and so i am a committed christian and i am someone who is proud to say that my value system my beliefs are shaped my faith and my faith in christ and i think that is informative for people to know and im not bashful about that
7040242 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
7040243 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
7040244 i will be playing for the peking universitys table tennis club in ocotber
7040245 as a result i am also thinking of enrolling in the peking university for studies
7040246 ive trained for so many years so i am feeling a bit tired
7040247 im also already 27 all these years i have missed out on the opportunity to do so many other things ive not had the chance to study either

7040277 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7040278 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7040279 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7040280 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7040281 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7040282 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7040283 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7040284 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7040285 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7040286 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7040287 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

7040293 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7040294 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7040295 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7040296 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7040297 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7040298 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7040299 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7040300 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7040301 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7040302 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7040303 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7040304 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7040305 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7040306 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7040307 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7040308 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7040309 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7040310 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7040311 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7040312 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7040313 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7040314 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7040315 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7040316 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7040317 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7040318 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7040319 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7040320 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7040321 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7040322 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7040323 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7040324 this year one of my goals is not to stress just kind of let life come as it is
7040325 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7040326 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7040327 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7040328 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7040329 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7040330 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7040331 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7040332 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7040333 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7040334 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7040335 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7040336 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7040337 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7040338 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7040339 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7040340 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7040341 this is a massive amount of carbon emissions even for a top celebrity icon
7040342 however these emissions will be swamped by those caused by the crowds of concertgoers
7040343 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7040344 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7040345 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7040346 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7040347 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7040348 its a confidential deal and the buyer wants anonymity but i can tell you it is not mr trump and its not republican presidential candidate john mccain
7040349 we wont stand for threats of this kind in colorado
7040350 a death threat is not a legitimate form of political expression
7040351 have i been paying state taxes on that restaurant all these years if it wasnt mine
7040352 not a day goes by maybe even a waking hour that i dont somehow encounter katrina in my memory
7040353 if my surroundings dont remind me of katrina the people around me are sure to do it every conversation about education healthcare housing economic development or criminal justice has its katrina component i visited the orleans parish house of detention a few days ago and was reminded that hundreds of inmates still live in tents remnants of the great storm
7040354 am i stuck in this fierce wind forever can my mind ever paddle out of this flood
7040355 its too soon to tell i guess even after three years as long as gaping caverns in our streets threaten to devour my vehicle i will think of katrina until the new hospitals are part of our skyline until the inmates are eight to a cell instead of 14 i will think of katrina until the schools the levees and the vast stretches of flood blighted neighborhoods are rebuilt i will always think of katrina
7040356 nagins award purports to come from an excellence in recovery host committee which appears to exist only in bernardos mind
7040357 the idea was presumably to help nagin recover from the bad ink that has dogged him ever since katrina but when he accepts the award tonight he can only come across as delusional
7040358 the er renovation will cost an estimated 4 million and we expect to see about 15 000 to 20 000 patient visits in the first year which translates to about 40 50 visits per day
7040359 i wonder whether anyone else was struck by the sharp contrast between jason david our saints cornerback acknowledging and taking personal responsibility for his poor play in saturday nights preseason game and how mayor ray nagin and his adminisration react in similar situations
7040360 many in our community would be more supportive of our mayor if he could learn from and follow in the future jasons example not his play but his response

7040375 the system proposed for poland and the czech republic doesnt exist has never been tested and has no demonstrated effectiveness to defend europe or the u s under realistic operational conditions
7040376 for these reasons the u s bmd system proposed for europe is causing strife with russia for nothing
7040377 lets not talk as if on one side we are dealing with pure white and fluffy partners and on the other side with a monster that has just left the forest

7040439 her real goal was to convince the west that the rigors of christian sexual morality were unnatural and that its anxiety producing inhibitions are something wed all be happier without
7040440 common rendezvous with their lovers and their liaisons were frequent and gay
7040441 the samoans were far more concerned with chastity and hence far less sexually promiscuous than westerners of the time
7040442 had the book been similarly unscientific but with an opposite ideology we no doubt would have ripped it apart for its scientific failings
7040443 atheism no longer has the luxury of speculating upon how grand the future will be once weve rid the world of priests and kings and brought heaven to earth

7040447 we are all entitled to our own opinion of funny
7040448 johan had mentioned that the other guy was still out there
7040449 i thought that for what hes done on the mound i had to give him the benefit of the doubt i thought that was only fair to him
7040450 right now weve got a great momentum going and everything is right there in front of us so i know i need to do my part to help out
7040451 at this point in the season you want to show youre able to go deep in the game we need that now even more because we dont have billy so what happened tonight was very satisfying

7040454 government resources arent nearly enough to meet peoples exercise needs
7040455 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7040456 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7040457 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7040458 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7040459 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7040460 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7040461 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7040462 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7040463 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7040464 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7040465 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7040466 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7040467 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7040468 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7040469 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7040470 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7040471 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7040472 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7040473 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7040474 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7040475 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7040476 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7040477 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7040478 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7040479 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7040480 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7040481 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7040482 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7040483 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7040484 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7040485 this is a planning took where all things are going
7040486 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7040487 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7040488 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7040489 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7040490 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7040491 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7040492 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7040493 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7040494 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7040495 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7040496 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7040497 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7040498 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7040499 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7040500 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7040501 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7040502 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7040503 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7040504 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7040505 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7040506 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7040507 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7040508 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7040509 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7040510 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7040511 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7040512 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7040513 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7040514 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7040515 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7040516 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7040517 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7040518 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7040519 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7040520 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7040521 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
7040522 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7040523 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7040524 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7040525 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7040526 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realising that barack obama is not ready to be president

7040528 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

7040533 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7040534 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7040535 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7040536 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7040537 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7040538 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7040539 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7040540 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

7040542 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7040543 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7040544 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7040545 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7040546 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7040547 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7040548 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7040549 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7040550 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7040551 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

7040556 theres a long ways to go here its fun to be bouncing back and forth i mean it would be nicer to get up there where the angels are and get a big lead but all we can do is control our games and go out and play them and do the best we can
7040557 hopefully well stay in this thing the whole way thats what we plan on doing and well go from there

7040561 span and delmon had a heck of a night driving the ball for us
7040562 delmon got a pitch out and over the plate and he crushed that ball weve seen this guy do this a few times this year he can flip a ball up in the stands with the best of them
7040563 he pitched a good game but its more than just perkins its been the way for us the last nine games weve played terrific baseball for so long up to this point we just have to get back into our game
7040564 this is not anything thats going to take a major overhaul we just need a few tweaks here and there some guys are gripping the bat too tight squeezing sawdust out of it we just have to refocus and get back to playing the game

7040568 in general it is fair to say that market forces are already achieving significant improvement broadband availability in maine has for example risen substantially just in the past year but it also seems clear that for the many rural areas of maine market forces alone may be insufficient to achieve full availability and coverage in the near term
7040569 expanding reliable affordable access to high speed internet and other advanced communications information technologies in rural or underserved areas of the state is as a general matter an appropriate state goal consistent with state telecommunications policy embodied in title 35 a section 7101

7040623 buddy harman set the standard both quantitatively and qualitatively for what a great country drummer should be
7040624 the mind boggles at the number of musically distinctive and emotionally fitting ways harman found to lay down a beat
7040625 hes nashvilles all around drummer and hes the best drummer i ever worked with

7040663 for there is not a just man on earth who does good and does not sin
7040664 do not marvel that i said to you you must be born again
7040665 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things have become new

7040731 you always want to be on top and starting on the pole here is very nice
7040732 the track isnt very easy and the surface is a bit slippery so to make a perfect lap is difficult i had a good lap and was able to score pole position i think we have a good car for the race tomorrow which will be very difficult but well try to do our best
7040733 i think i made pole in the first sector of my lap which was fantastic
7040734 i made some very small mistakes in sector two and then i had a good final sector but i think everything was done in the first sector the track is getting better all the time and yesterday we saw the lap time improve so quickly throughout the sessions
7040735 we have a great car and we showed it in the last race but unfortunately sometimes these things can happen but we show here that were competitive again which is the most important thing
7040736 we noticed we had a good car in practice and q1 and q2 was just about getting through which is never a big problem i stayed on the option tyre for my two flying laps the first one wasnt great but i think my last lap was pretty good and i was happy with that for sure theres always a bit of time somewhere to be had but we have a good starting position for tomorrow
7040737 felipe just destroyed everyone in sector one and hes going to be difficult to beat tomorrow but well push and try
7040738 generally my lap wasnt too bad and i am quite happy with it

7040749 his leadership qualities have improved tremendously over the last couple of years and his ability is there for all to see
7040750 i dont think anyone was actually nailed on for it
7040751 it was always a flip of the coin between rio or john terry
7040752 at rios age i dont think we need to worry about the effect of what happened
7040753 but it was the managers choice and he has chosen john terry rio just has to get on with it it is as simple as that
7040754 unselfishness is maybe not the biggest crime to have as a football
7040755 it shows qualities of teamwork and a general nature which is terrific to see in footballers
7040756 we are in an era of individual appreciation earrings tattoos goals the need to be seen
7040757 i am enjoying it more than i have ever done as long as we win
7040758 when you are younger there is another 10 years in front of you so maybe you dont take it in as much
7040759 i thought about moscow a lot more than i did barcelona in 1999
7040760 i knew it could be the last time i played in the champions league final and i will go into games this season thinking it could be the last time i play in the tournament
7040761 last season ended unbelievably well for the team and myself
7040762 and with the exciting players we have here now hopefully it can get better
7040763 when you look at the potential of this team it can go on and dominate for the next five or 10 years
7040764 we saw glimpses of it was capable of last year the test is now to go on and build on it and i want to be involved at the start
7040765 last season proved how much we needed a big squad
7040766 we were quite lucky at the end because nearly everyone was fit at the champions league final
7040767 but we had injuries throughout the season which we coped with pretty well that experience will only help us
7040768 we do not want to get too far behind at the start because it could be difficult to peg teams back
7040769 last season was an exception when we got two points from three games before that arsenal got off to great starts so we want to start winning
7040770 im not sure what it tastes like but it tastes good
7040771 this is giving you a positive alternative that there is something out there on the forefront thats healthy for kids
7040772 a person may not know any underlying conditions they may have reasons behind this if it interferes with a simple vitamin they might be taking
7040773 the fact that it also contains a warning should be a little concerning to people too
7040774 oh when the saints come marchin in oh when the saints come marchin in lord i want to be in that number when the saints come marchin in
7040775 in all revolutions there are noisy and dangerous times as the old order is replaced by the now after the dust settles we can proceed to build the beautiful kingdom that the lord has purposed from the foundations of the world
7040776 behold i will send and bring nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon
7040777 the lord said this this is where my people will rise up as an army and bring millions into the kingdom of god
7040778 this army is unique when this army comes its large and mighty its so mighty that there has never been anything like it before not even when moses not even david not even paul whats going to happen now will transcend what paul did what david did what moses did
7040779 in the near future we will not be looking back at the early church with envy because of the great exploits of those days but all will be saying that he certainly did save the best wine for last the most glorious times in all of history have not come upon us you who have dreamed of one day being able to talk with peter john and paul are going to be surprised to find that they have all been waiting to talk to you
7040780 and you have tested those who say they are apostles and are not and have found them liars
7040781 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into apostles of christ
7040782 rick joyner the harvest 128 129 so from what i can gather joyner says that they are going to reverse what the apostle paul did
7040783 i have more to boast of than any man ever had i am the only man that has ever been able to keep a church together since the days of adam neither paul john peter nor jesus ever did it i boast that no man ever did such a work as i
7040784 when this army comes he says its large and its mighty
7040785 the result of that visitation is that the poor misguided flock is united and transformed into a majestic war horse a great vehicle of power and energy a fearsome awe inspiring effective tool of war
7040786 those in this army will have the kind of anointing his kind of power anyone who wants to harm them must die
7040787 i had a vision of you people coming from a circle of maybe a hundred miles and i saw people coming from every major city within that circumference and a great conclave was taking place and it was the training of joels army i believe that people are going to come together by the thousands and train for the army of the lord thats long overdue
7040788 i had a dream that became a recurring dream and it was about all the stadiums and weve told this hundreds and hundreds of time all across america all over the world in fact and i saw these stadiums and football fields soccer fields and sports arenas all of them filled with thousands of people sometimes over 100 000 in each place
7040789 promise keepers meeting april 29 1995 detroit silver dome the last time i read the scripture it was jesus who was the captain of the lords army and he was in charge then as he is now in the church who will be the leaders or leader of this church army we have no appointed generals except self appointed ones today god has made local churchs as part of the universal church each is autonomous none answer to a leadership that controls them all since they are to be called men in the pastorate listening to gods direction for their communities as well as in the world why wouldnt you want to be a part of what god wants to do with his hand picked leaders i think almighty god is going to rip open the hearts of our leaders i think hes going to tear them open and i think hes going to put them back together again as one one leadership w eve got to have one leadership one leadership only weve got to have everybody hitting on all cylinders theres only one race its the human race theres only one culture its christ before culture christ culture thats all that there is
7040790 in dreams and visions blue often represents heavenly mindedness the sky is blue and gray speaks of those who live by the power of their own minds the brain is often called gray matter this will be a conflict between those but who live mostly according to their natural minds and human wisdom and those who follow the holy spirit
7040791 i do not believe that this prophecy can now be stopped or that the lord wants it stopped
7040792 to drive the accuser out of the church and for the church then to come into a unity that would otherwise be impossible
7040793 criticism is one of the ultimate manifestations of pride because whenever we criticize someone else we are by that assuming that we are superior to them pride brings that which any rational human being should fear the most gods resistance we would be better off having all of the demons in hell resisting us than god

7040801 i think when people are looking at the olympics in 2012 britain home of football where football was invented which we gave to the world i think people would be very surprised if there is an olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it
7040802 i am determined to work with the football associations and the olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing
7040803 he is out of touch with the overwhelming views of football supporters throughout the uk
7040804 all the national supporters groups oppose this move and see it as a threat to the status of their nations to field independent football squads
7040805 not only do all the national supporters associations oppose such a move but the majority of football associations in the uk have said they do not want to take part in a single uk team as it could threaten their existence within fifa
7040806 instead of trying to brow beat the sfa the ifa and the football association of wales into a single team gordon brown should abandon his campaign which threatens the identity of each of the home associations and their national squads
7040807 up until till now there have been very few organisations that have taken franchisees best interest to heart
7040808 we are going places that no one has dared to go before by launching the new franchisee association

7040815 when my wife and i got married i worked while she went to school we barely had enough to survive just enough for one car payment and an apartment
7040816 i had always been interested in cars but i couldnt afford to buy the components that i wanted for the car so im pretty much self taught on everything i just started learning how to weld and how to fabricate and i used my car as a template
7040817 some of the parts that i built helped it to get better traction at the track
7040818 it was safer and i made the suspension adjustable its not adjustable from the factory
7040819 it kept going that way and i thought maybe i can do something with this
7040820 id worked for people who didnt seem to appreciate me
7040821 this is a manufactured product and there is a heavy design component to it the engineering aspect is very critical i brought all of that experience to the table
7040822 i had a desire to purchase my own business and wanted it to be a small manufacturing company
7040823 i thought it would be a great idea to mix my hobby and my profession
7040824 hes a product designer he has his own shop he develops products on his own time i manufacture and market them he gets a commission based on the sales volume that type of arrangement could blow up in many types of situations but i think its going to work out great for us
7040825 allan miller wanted to run a business but he didnt know how to design the product the seller brett rockey wanted to design the product but he didnt want to run the business
7040826 the job of an m amp a intermediary is to bring buyer and seller together and let the chemistry and the personalities work together to bring an offer to a deal

7040834 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7040835 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7040836 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7040837 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7040838 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7040839 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7040840 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7040891 a lot of these guys were in the dominican and venezuelan summer leagues they want to grow fast and a related factor is that when they get here theyre generally younger than the guys theyre competing with most of whom were drafted out of college so sometimes they look for a shortcut but there are no shortcuts
7040892 we continue to talk about in detail to prospects its like pfp pitchers fielding practice repeat repeat repeat i think we also have to make sure we have bilingual doctors in latin america who understand the commissioners drug policy
7040893 i would rather lose a game than take a chance of hurting anybody
7040894 you cant stress enough that the hero stuff sometimes works in the world but it doesnt work here
7040895 i wouldnt be surprised if they finished where they are now
7040896 tampa bay is playing unbelievable baseball nobody expected tampa bay to be there but ive been saying since the start of the year they have the players
7040897 ive never been one to say that pressure was too much for me but ive felt like ive had a lot of weight on my shoulders just trying to be perfect trying to do everything as well as i could to help this team win and it hasnt been near good enough
7040898 the decision was coming it had to be made soon they had given me ample opportunity to help this team and to help myself out up here and it just hasnt worked out
7040899 tell them you have been abused and you will receive all you need
7040900 my husband could black my eye so me and the kid could go to a battered womans shelter
7040901 you dont put up any more barriers for victims wanting to enter the shelter
7040902 in all the time that i volunteered there i saw one woman who showed signs of physical abuse
7040903 were just gaming the system all they had to do was make up some tale about some man abusing them no proof needed and they could stay up to two months at the shelter
7040904 free hostel for women with emotional problems if they are willing to hate their husbands enough and are willing to take out protective orders against their husbands
7040905 i played one game mick mccarthy was in charge and he didnt play me again it was the worst part of my career
7040906 i was walking to my car at ten past three on a saturday outside molineux and i could hear the crowd i thought what am i doing i had a three and a half hour drive home i questioned being a footballer i wasnt going anywhere
7040907 i knew i might not get another one i couldnt mess around any more i had to do everything to make sure i couldnt be left out
7040908 i didnt want to go anywhere but to be linked with them was fantastic
7040909 most people would want to play for liverpool or any of the top four in their career
7040910 i honestly believe that im a better player now than i was in 1988 when i won the world championships
7040911 to play against these guys on a regular basis again has been really fantastic it has really woken me up and told me i can still do it but at the age of 60 im very happy to be in the league
7040912 i am definitely coming back next year i like the feel of that its been a number of years since i picked up a trophy but i liked the feeling and id like to do it again next year
7040913 im definitely confident of defending the title i think i laid down a pretty big ticket tonight saying what im capable of im a year older but the passion wont have diminished one jot
7040914 tonight was a totally different mindset it was kill or be killed right through the league youre thinking there is another match next week and that is a totally different mindset one we are not really used to
7040915 but im used to win or youre in the car park and that was my focus tonight and im happy to say i did just that
7040916 but i think we were the best two players throughout the tournament
7040917 senator joe biden has been an agent of change for nearly 36 years in the united state senate
7040918 he made me feel things i didnt know what to do with
7040919 the music spoke to parts of me that had never been addressed it opened up some other place in me like letting oxygen into a sealed crypt for the first time
7040920 my sound has changed radically i hope i dont sound the same after doing this for 32 years
7040921 im very clear about my job its to facilitate a connection with the audience if someone can come out to my show and get 90 minutes of relief or joy then its worth it were all so busy with these crazy full lives of ours most of us anyway
7040922 being bullheaded and doing damn well whatever i please both creatively and musically
7040923 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7040924 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7040925 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7040926 today i make an announcement of hope for all of america
7040927 i have scoured the country and beheld a nation poised on the cusp of change who will help me lead the united states into the brave new landscape of politics as unusual

7040934 this is stuff we deserve we helped the party get people elected
7040935 maybe in 2004 it was about being accommodating and innovative but this time around theres a real fight for power in the party
7040936 its a recognition from the d n c of the work that youve done of your import your significance
7040937 we were the site the d n c was talking about we just assumed we would get it
7040938 nobody here certainly not i believes theres only one good blog in every state
7040939 its unprecedented access for bloggers yes but its certainly not equal access

7040944 i have no interest in going to the convention hall and chances are i will not
7040945 theres nothing happening in the convention hall that would justify braving the long security lines and crowds
7040946 i would never go to my readers and say i really need a vacation
7040947 its kind of humbling that people value what were doing to the point where theyre willing to give us 20
7040948 people ought to be giving it to a candidate not giving me their spare money
7040949 it takes me back to my hippie ish youth thrown in a situation with very little to fall back on and not 100 percent certain where ill be sleeping

7040959 to go out and knock over a team like that i thought the energy in the field was excellent and to get a few wickets is always nice
7040960 it was one of those rare days in cricket where you must savour the score the bears were 29 8 at one stage
7040961 i thought james bowled really well bowled nice and straight and bowled a good length which was really important
7040962 we talked about that as a bowling group before we went out that we needed to bowl a good length just back of a length and see what happened
7040963 their batters had to take a risk playing across the line and the plan came off well
7040964 our batters have got to take a lot of credit for getting us to 218 on that wicket which was pretty low pretty slow and taking a bit of turn

7040971 i am a co sponsor of the local law enforcement enhancement act which would expand federal jurisdiction to reach violent hate crimes perpetrated because of the race color religion national origin sexual orientation gender identity or physical disability of the victim
7040972 i believe the employment non discrimination act should be expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity i sponsored legislation in the illinois state senate that would ban discrimination in employment on the basis of sexual orientation
7040973 i believe that we need to repeal the dont ask dont tell policy the key test for military service should be patriotism a sense of duty and a willingness to serve
7040974 on this issue i have been at the forefront of any of the presidential candidates
7040975 i do not support gay marriage marriage has religious and social connotations and i consider marriage to be between a man and a woman
7040976 this is an issue that i think helps to describe who we are marriage connotes to so many people a religious and not just civil element and that includes me
7040977 my view is that we should try to disentangle what has historically been the issue of the word marriage which has religious connotations to some people from the civil rights that are given to couples in terms of hospital visitation in terms of whether or not they can transfer property or any of the other social security benefits and so forth
7040978 i continue to support a civil union that provides all the benefits that are available for a legally sanctioned marriage
7040979 i support the complete repeal of the defense of marriage act doma
7040980 i believe the employment non discrimination act should be expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity
7040981 we need to do more in our schools to foster tolerance and an acceptance of diversity

7040984 when we were looking to relocate to phoenix we wanted a realtor who was internet savvy that would be able to work with us from southern california efficently through email or digital photos we found bloodhound online and made a trip to phoenix to look around we didnt have a specific timeline in mind but cathleen took a day and showed us some homes we had looked at on the mls she also told us about an area where new homes were going to be built in the city limits since we didnt want to be further out west or in the outlining areas of phoenix we selected our new home quickly after viewing the model she knew we wanted specific things and one of the models was exactly what we were looking for in a floorplan during the entire home building process cathleen kept in contact with us building an online portal for us to see photos when we were unable to come to do a walk through at various stages in the process she was incredibly friendly and kind during this long 9 1 2 month process we just closed escrow on march 15th and are getting settled we truly appreciated everything bloodhound did for us they have a very high level of customer satisfaction service and their knowledge about the real estate laws and building laws for codes in arizona is an asset especially for people such as ourselves moving into the state for the first time we felt welcomed to arizona long before we moved and hope to have a continued relationship with bloodhound in the future we will definitely recommend them to anyone who asks for a referral to a great realtor
7040985 fantastic i see that once again carola and i thank you for the excellent job you did for us everyone i spoke to about how you facilitated this whole house buying process was just as impressed with your thoroughness and dependability as i was my conversations with relatives in arizona who have recently bought homes made it really clear that this level of service and competence is outstanding well beyond the norm people are just amazed by the fact that we could initiate this from germany come to arizona for a week one month later and go away with the house deal basically in the bag you delivered exactly what we wanted

7040989 we often get sent links to images from our customers asking for actions to reproduce a certain style and the kidz set is a response to these requests

7040994 these factors caused the increase on the stock market 6 months after the sporting event
7040995 the infrastructure construction system establishment and environmental protection among others for the olympics gave a lasting boost to the hosting countries economy therefore although gdp growth in those hosting countries showed a certain degree of slow down generally speaking the hosting countries economy maintained a relatively high speed of growth whats more the reduction of bubbles in the post olympics capital market has typically ensured steady and benign growth history clearing indicates that the lasting winner of the beijing olympics will be the beijing economy

7041168 philosophy may be defined as the art of asking the right questions
7041169 and so for example the problem of religious philosophy is not how does man arrive at an understanding of god but rather how can we arrive at an understanding of god
7041170 the theme of the present study is the act of believing its purpose is to explore the depth of faith the substratum of of which belief arises and its method may be called depth theology
7041171 ideas of faith must not be studied in total separation from the moments of faith
7041172 religion is liable to distortion from without and to corruption from within hypocrisy rather than heresy is the cause of spiritual decay thou desirest truth in the inwardness of man psalms 51 8
7041173 hebrew thinking operates within categories different from those of plato or aristotle and the disagreemetns between their respective teachings are not merely a matter of different ways of expression but of different ways of thinking
7041174 the bible does not intend to teach us principles of creation or redemption it came to teach us that god is alive that he is the creator and redeemer teacher and lawgiver
7041175 to try to distill the bible which is bursting with life drama and tension to a series of principles would be like trying to reduce a living person to a diagram
7041176 on the other hand he who would try to reduce the bible to a catalog of events to a sacred history will equally fail the lord is one or justice justice shalt thou pursue is an idea or a norm rather than an occurrence a philosophy of judaism therefore is a philosophy of both ideas and events
7041177 two sources of religious thinking are given us memory tradition and personal insight we must rely on our memory and we must strive for fresh insight we hear from tradition we also understand through our own seeking the prophets appeal to the spiritual power in man know therefore this day and lay it to your heart that the lord is god in heaven above and on the earth beneath there is no other deuteronomy 4 39 the spalmist calls on us o taste and see that the lord is good 34 9 how does one know how does one taste
7041178 god is waiting for man to seek him the lord looked forth from heaven upon the children of man to see if there were any man of understanding that sought him psalms 14 2 p 30
7041179 there are three starting points of contemplation about god three trails that lead to him the first is the way of sensing the presence of god in the world in things the second is the way of sensing his presence in the bible the third is the way of sensing his presence in sacred deeds these three ways correspond in our tradition to the main aspects of religious existence worship learning and action the three are one and we must go all three ways to reach the one destination

7041198 it was one of those rare days in cricket where you must savour the score the bears were 29 8 at one stage
7041199 i thought james bowled really well bowled nice and straight and bowled a good length which was really important
7041200 we talked about that as a bowling group before we went out that we needed to bowl a good length just back of a length and see what happened
7041201 their batters had to take a risk playing across the line and the plan came off well
7041202 our batters have got to take a lot of credit for getting us to 218 on that wicket which was pretty low pretty slow and taking a bit of turn

7041265 my husband watches olympics all day long and doesnt talk to me
7041266 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7041267 i have not selected him as i do not think he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7041268 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game
7041269 im convinced that he will stay robinho has not told me he wont play tomorrow he is an important player for us and weve made that clear
7041270 i prefer to talk about tomorrows game there is no discussion about robinho robinho has been included in the squad because he is in perfect condition i want to win the title tomorrow for real madrid
7041271 i expected him to make them before i dont think we should over dramatise it all there are more important things for us right now
7041272 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7041273 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7041274 i can tell you that madrid are not going to transfer robinho we are not going to sell him if he wants to go then he should go now telling the press about it is not the right way to do things
7041275 its not necessarily that he will have to pay the 150 million euros he would end his contract but the courts will decide what he has to pay
7041276 no because the transfers need to be done at the end of the competition not five days before the start of the season its a lack of respect to the club its history and to the fans
7041277 we want robinho to stay in madrid right now with this situation we cannot do anything
7041278 that is the ground he had first time up at sandown and it is the first time he has had it again since he clearly handles that sort of surface good to soft very well
7041279 i trained his mother and she was a miler but being by dalakhani there is plenty of stamina there and he wasnt stopping at the end
7041280 it was my fault he wasnt left in the st leger i will discuss it with the owners but there is enough money in the pot from today if they decide to supplement
7041281 you always want to be top and to start from pole here for the first time is very nice
7041282 the track is not easy its slippery so a perfect lap is difficult but i was able to score pole and we have a good car for the race and lets hope we can have a good one
7041283 as weve shown in so many races this year that is the case and as we did in the last race but sometimes things happen
7041284 its always nice to be on top after such a result we dont know how the race will be but its always nice to be on pole
7041285 we had a good car in practice we came through q1 and q2 which is never a problem
7041286 i saved the option tyre for q3 and although my first lap wasnt good the second one was and weve managed to get a great position
7041287 but felipe destroyed everyone in sector one of the track so he is going to be very hard to beat
7041288 it was a very good qualifying for myself and the team
7041289 quero que eles concluam magnificamente um ciclo que foi magn fico quero servir de ferramenta para que eles alcancem isso

7041326 geroosterd brood je let even niet op en hup ineens is het verbrand wat doe je dan gooi je het weg geef je het aan een ander of eet je het zelf maar op tot nu toe heb ik altijd die stukjes verbrande toast opgegeten dat heb ik van mijn moeder geleerd zij zorgde altijd voor iedereen behalve voor zichzelf zij at altijd die stukjes die niemand anders wilde hebben die ingebakken zelfopoffering was goed bedoeld maar uiteindelijk zond ze daarmee gemengde signalen uit ik heb ervan geleerd dat vrouwen altijd met minder genoegen moeten nemen en als ik eens een goudbruin sneetje geroosterd brood kreeg dacht ik dat het dan altijd ten koste van een ander was gegaan tot het moment dat ik veertig werd wilde ik echt de komende tien jaar op dezelfde voet verdergaan het gemakkelijke antwoord nee het minder gemakkelijke inzicht luidde dat als ik wilde veranderen ik niet langer met minder genoegen moest nemen ik mocht er niet meer van uitgaan dat alles toch wel zou mislukken en het gevoel dat ik niet beter verdiende daar was ik helemaal klaar mee het roer ging om en ik gun anderen diezelfde ommezwaai daarom heb ik dit boek geschreven het is mijn maffe serieuze uitgelaten hartgrondige poging om mijn grillige weg naar het geluk te vertellen aan anderen mensen zoals ik

7041333 is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason
7041334 if a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him because he finds something indecent about her and he writes her a certificate of divorce
7041335 anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness and marries another woman commits adultery against her and if she divorces her husband and marries another man she commits adultery
7041336 jesus upheld the dignity of women by speaking out against divorce which particularly injured women in the ancient world
7041337 in his treatment of divorce jesus clearly regards women not as property but as persons they have legitimate rights and should be respected
7041338 anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart
7041339 women were employed by jesus quite freely as illustrations in his teaching
7041340 this is in stark contrast to the rabbis of the day one looks in vain in their teachings for even one story or sermon illustration that mentions women
7041341 blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you
7041342 those who hear the word of god and obey it
7041343 he gave her his undivided attention by listening to her comment and he mildly corrected her and pointed her toward further spiritual understanding jesus does not deny his mothers place of importance but goes beyond it to a wider spiritual truth
7041344 refused to limit a womans horizon to nurturing family and cooking
7041345 whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother
7041346 she has done a beautiful thing to me i tell you the truth wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world what she has done will also be told in memory of her
7041347 jesus gave no explicit teaching on the role of women in the church in fact he left no teaching at all concerning women as a class of people he treated every woman he met as a person in her own right
7041348 jesus stopped short of ever making any explicit pronouncements about the equality of men and women even to the extent that paul does in galatians 3 28 to say nothing of attempting to overthrow sociocultural conventions on gender roles jesus cannot fairly be co opted for modern liberationist or egalitarian agendas neither the gospels nor the book of acts can prove decisive in answering the question of whether the first generation of christians in general or paul in particular reserved any leadership roles for men for that one must turn to pauls writings themselves
7041349 the approach most often taken by rabbinic judaism to sexual temptation seems to have been the reduction to a minimum of any sort of contact between the sexes

7041353 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7041354 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7041355 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7041356 americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken washington arent going to find them on the obama biden ticket

7041384 until today creating and running multiplayer flash games has been out of the question for most developers due to the high cost of commercial media servers open source offerings inability to scale beyond a few hundred simultaneous users and the server and internet connection resources required to handle high traffic
7041385 with the release today of our multiplayer api those days are now officially over
7041386 the nonoba multiplayer api and game server handle all the difficult parts such as server connections server communication and bringing players together in the same game

7041400 after that i fought hard to hold him off though the last 15 seconds was quite nervous
7041401 fourth is the worst place for me so its a big disappointment
7041402 julien was simply unbeatable today he did a good job sadly this wasnt the case for me its sad because this was my last chance for a medal this is my last olympics
7041403 the olympic games is once every four years and so today i really believed i could achieve one of my dreams
7041404 i am totally overwhelmed this photo is so important to my family i never got to meet my granddad but he and my nan were always at the heart of our family my brother michael even has the photo tattooed across his back my family have always been very proud of our black country roots my grandfather especially so this is a great tribute to him
7041405 the aim of the big picture was to encourage as many different people of all ages and interests to get involved to help create a detailed piece of social history the final mosaic is a fascinating insight into the lives and loves of the people of the west midlands we know from the thousands of photographs we received that sport plays a huge part in the lives of people living in this region so i think its particularly fitting that the selection of the final image has enabled us to celebrate our sporting heritage with this amazing transformation
7041406 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7041407 carter seems to have 3 positions on every issue and i guess that is why there are 3 debates
7041408 no i will not be vice president under any circumstances
7041409 llegamos con los conceptos claros los jugadores saben a lo que juegan y el nivel de compromiso tambi n es bueno todo lo que pod amos tener controlado lo est pero lo importante es el d a del valladolid
7041410 por las noticias que salen parece que s se va a ir alguien aunque no lo s al cien por cien me hubiese gustado que se quedaran todos los jugadores
7041411 ya era hora de saber d nde voy a jugar he decidido venir al celta porque el proyecto me parece ilusionante creo que hay un buen equipo y adem s se trata de un club con historia
7041412 ten a posibilidades de haberme quedado en el mallorca pero soy ego sta como todos los futbolistas y quiero jugar partidos quiero avanzar deportivamente y para eso necesito jugar tengo 24 a os y no me interesaba tener pocos minutos
7041413 r man lite avm tt s tycker ungdomarna man r en torrfitta och r man f r skojfrisk vill de bara d
7041414 we really didnt have any inside information said adler who interned in bidens office on capitol hill before he went to college
7041415 theres a level of comfort with joe biden especially among the hispanic and jewish communities where theres a strong interest in foreign affairs he said
7041416 hes got incredible experience and thoughtfulness on the world stage
7041417 la decisi n fue r pida porque no me lo pens dos veces adem s lo consult con mi familia y todos est bamos de acuerdo y estoy encantado de la vida
7041418 hay un a o por delante y durante el campeonato veremos que pasa
7041419 it was scary not being able to play i was just sitting there hoping the headache goes away i definitely was thinking about what i could do other than soccer
7041420 it gave me enough time in between that if i were to get another one what happened to ross hopefully wouldnt happen to me all credit to them
7041421 his one on one defending has been good obviously hes still very dominant in the air
7041422 what im happy about is hes a lot more willing to have the ball to take the ball and have more responsibility for the ball in the back hes got good feet for a big man
7041423 people dont know that because chad shied away from sometimes wanting the ball he can get himself out of trouble and do things with the ball
7041424 our communication is improving he cleans up a lot of balls in the air and wins possession pretty good so he tries to keep me in front of him tells me when to stay tells me when to go
7041425 i think im pretty vocal guy i just dont like doing interviews
7041426 if you do a good job then no one notices i guess i do not want to be noticed because that means my guy is scoring or im messing up
7041427 the second half our team started moving the ball a little too direct going too much to the strikers and chad marshall did a good job intercepting balls to feet and that caused kenny cooper some problems
7041428 he has been a little bit overlooked hes a great defender and a big reason weve had success this year
7041429 i came into this league as a teenager now im 24 i think i was the third longest here after my second year they really cleaned house its been that way for a while
7041430 weve finally found that right blend of players who know what their responsibilities are and dont try to play outside of that
7041431 people know what theyre good at and stick to that and let the creative people create and guys like me head the ball and kick it really far
7041432 its similar we have really good players and guys who are putting in goals the most important thing is that were scoring goals
7041433 i feel like the middle three years we really didnt score goals thats what the good teams in this league do and thats what were doing thats why were getting wins
7041434 the mccain campaigns constant invocation of the candidates pow past is weird bordering on irrational
7041435 is obama bashing american dream by bashing mccains 7 homes
7041436 everybody wanted to win out there practice is over our team ended up losing and im still ticked off about it
7041437 if we can breed that practice every day that competitiveness will translate into games and hopefully make us a successful team
7041438 this year has been awesome obviously because weve been winning our chemistry has always been great in the locker room we have great guys and everybody gets along theres no hot heads or egos
7041439 it took a couple of years to build that weve put the people in the right position and now we fight for each other and fight to win
7041440 its about having the coach that can get the right players and being in the right atmosphere its not easy to do at the professional level and new england coach steve nicol did a great job getting guys that enjoyed playing together and worked hard
7041441 we came back last week against dallas and got a good victory these guys look like they work hard on and off the field
7041442 sigis got a good group of young guys that work hard and get along on and off the field it goes a long way because when you got guys that want to play for each other and win for each other it makes things a lot easier
7041443 theres a good group of guys here who have been involved in some successful teams and when you have that experience mixed in with some good results you build a little bit of confidence and maybe that has helped us play a little better each game
7041444 it feels like a good team we need to continue to improve and work for each other and let the results take care of themselves and not worry about the past
7041445 the mentality is much better you always want to create competitive training sessions thats the most important thing to create as you try to improve the team
7041446 very few teams in this league have won 50 percent of their games i think its us and new england from that standpoint im very proud of what weve done as you go through the experience of winning as you go through the experience of being behind and winning the game thats something you can do to help your confidence
7041447 what this team needs to do is win games that are big games or theres something on the line whether thats an open cup game or todays game puts us in first place thats the next thing we need to get confidence in but weve made huge strides
7041448 expectations have to be based in reality and we have the reality now that our expectations are reasonable and are expectations are to win every time we step on the field
7041449 our expectations are to make it to the playoffs and our expectations are to compete for other postseason awards and the mls title
7041450 i didnt think we played well in the first half we were lucky we were just off we were a little bit lethargic but as you said the character of the team is great
7041451 they listen to what we have to say at halftime they came out in the second half with a lot more energy we were a lot more direct with our play we stretched their defense got behind them and as a result of that we started to create some chances and then the goals came
7041452 my fitness wasnt what i liked i wasnt getting behind and getting onto some of the services but it was good to be out there getting some minutes and getting a feel for things its especially good to be part of a victory
7041453 minutes and a couple of weeks of training and ill be 100 percent it was good to be out there and get a feel for how guys work and what they look for i told sigi the best thing was to take me out and then the offense got going getting two late goals was big
7041454 in the first 10 minutes it was very hard because i needed to get on the pace again
7041455 its not easy to come back but in the second half i felt better sharper and more confident with the ball im so happy i could contribute to getting three points again
7041456 we want to keep winning at home we have one more win than we had last year at home i dont think thats enough
7041457 of course we have those numbers in the back of our heads
7041458 the most important thing is winning well take it one half at a time score the goals we need to score and well do the job were getting closer to our point total with 10 games left so our goal is to eclipse that the wins will come well ride this wave and see what happens
7041459 the east is very strong and everyones starting to make the final push if you get 41 42 you should be all right but i dont want to say that and jinx it
7041460 if we get to maybe 43 points in the next in four games were in the playoffs
7041461 we definitely wanted to come get three points and make a statement that were for real
7041462 we wanted to come down and really put it to them but theyre a good team and they play really well in houston in all this heat
7041463 we were out a few guys with suspensions some injuries and guys stepped up it was to be expected that things would be a little disorganized with some new guys but everybody fought and gave ourselves a chance to get a point we just came up short today
7041464 weve got to continue to work on mathis fitness first and foremost
7041465 once we get him to a level that were all comfortable with then we know the soccers there
7041466 weve got a huge game against the columbus crew this week
7041467 i know houstons got one in the midweek and well see what happens but we might have a chance to get into first well see weve just got to go back to looking at tape and seeing defensively where we went wrong

7041557 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
7041558 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
7041559 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming
7041560 was 0 3 f cooler than the 1901 2000 average
7041561 its not ice melt but rather wind circulation that drives ocean currents northward from the tropics climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of man made warming on polar ice melt
7041562 i will make a commitment that al gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem hes somebody i talk to on a regular basis im already consulting with him in terms of these issues but climate change is real
7041563 possible to kill more flies with honey than with vinegar
7041564 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7041565 this is about shifting the power back to the people
7041566 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7041567 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7041568 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7041569 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7041570 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7041571 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7041572 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7041573 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7041574 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7041575 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7041576 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7041577 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7041578 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7041579 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7041580 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7041581 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7041582 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7041583 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7041584 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7041585 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7041586 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7041587 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7041588 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7041589 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7041590 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7041591 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7041592 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
7041593 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
7041594 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
7041595 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
7041596 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
7041597 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
7041598 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7041599 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7041600 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7041601 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7041602 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7041603 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7041604 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7041605 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7041606 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate

7041609 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7041610 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7041611 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7041612 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7041613 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7041614 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7041615 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7041616 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7041617 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7041618 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7041619 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7041620 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7041621 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7041622 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7041623 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7041624 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7041625 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7041626 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7041627 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7041628 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7041629 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7041630 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7041631 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7041632 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7041633 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7041634 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7041635 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7041636 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7041637 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7041638 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7041639 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7041640 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7041641 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7041642 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7041643 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7041644 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7041645 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7041646 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7041647 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7041648 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7041649 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7041650 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7041651 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7041652 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7041653 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7041654 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7041655 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7041656 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7041657 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7041658 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7041659 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7041660 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7041661 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7041662 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7041663 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7041664 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7041665 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7041666 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7041667 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7041668 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7041669 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7041670 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7041671 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7041672 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7041673 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7041674 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7041675 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7041676 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7041677 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7041678 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7041679 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7041680 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7041681 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7041682 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7041683 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7041684 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7041685 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7041686 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7041687 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7041688 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7041689 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7041690 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7041691 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7041692 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7041693 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7041694 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7041695 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7041696 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7041697 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7041698 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7041699 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7041700 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7041701 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7041702 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7041703 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7041704 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7041705 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7041706 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7041707 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7041708 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7041709 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7041710 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7041711 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7041712 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7041713 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7041714 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7041715 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7041716 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7041717 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7041718 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7041719 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7041720 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7041721 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7041722 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7041723 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7041724 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7041725 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7041726 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7041727 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7041728 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7041729 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7041730 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7041731 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7041732 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7041733 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7041734 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7041735 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7041736 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7041737 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7041738 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7041739 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7041740 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7041741 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7041742 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7041743 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7041744 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7041745 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7041746 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7041747 baru berasa akan mempertanggung jawabkan janji sehidup semati ya deg degan karena bukan hanya di depan orang tua tapi juga dihadapan tuhan dan saudara saudara

7041750 insurgents engaged the soldiers from multiple points within the compound using small arms and rpg rocket propelled grenade fire

7041752 more than 30 people have been killed i cannot say how many of them are civilians
7041753 twenty five taliban were killed including sidiq and one other commander

7041827 denounced barack obama s poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7041828 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7041829 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7041830 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7041831 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7041832 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7041834 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time

7041883 the hiv establishment and its journalist allies have replied to various specific criticisms of the hiv theory without taking them seriously they have never provided an authoritative paper that undertakes to prove that hiv really is the cause of aids after ten years of failure it is time to take a second look
7041884 i feel that for scientists to remain silent in the face of all this doubt is tantamount to criminal negligence
7041885 every virus ive ever seen gets its job done by killing a cell at a time and when it has killed enough you get sick hiv is said to be responsible for the loss of t cells which are the immune system now in every aids patient studied so far there is never more than on average one in 1 000 cells infected by hiv
7041886 there are a million americans with hiv who are totally healthy there are six million africans according to the world health organization who have hiv 129 000 had aids by the end of last year that means five million eight hundred and so many thousand had no aids half a million europeans have hiv and 60 000 have aids so there are millions and millions of people on this planet who have hiv but no aids why dont seven and a half million get autoimmune disease if hiv is the cause of an autoimmune disease
7041887 well the establishment says that everybody with hiv will develop aids and its just a matter of time
7041888 in the last ten years this has happened in america to about 20 percent of people with hiv 250 000 including deaths to date out of a million but the people who are dying from aids are hardly ever your all american friends of 20 to 40 years of age virtually all heterosexual americans and europeans who had aids are intravenous drug users and the homosexuals who get aids had hundreds if not thousands of sexual contacts that is not achieved with your conventional testosterone it is achieved with chemicals those are the risk groups they inhale poppers they use amphetamines they take quaaludes they take amyl nitrite they take cocaine as aphrodisiacs

7041949 certainly it is true that we can use our imaginations to escape the realities of life but it is also true that we can use our imaginations to reimagine reality so as to transform it through the power of the spirit into the world of shalom
7041950 just as food nourishes the body and a home protects the family education and creativity nourish the mind which in turn empowers the body and physical existence and makes for a life more deeply lived

7041956 joe biden tiene una dilatada experiencia en pol tica exterior
7041957 if you get those individuals that fit the federal requirements it creates the american dream like no other program ive ever witnessed

7041959 a house in galveston for this price would either be really old or rundown or have something wrong with it
7041960 being able to have a new house thats a decent size for us is really nice
7041961 your tax dollars would help this wacko try to get elected
7041962 if we dont many will continue to serve special interests
7041963 studies have shown that it actually reduces confidence in government
7041964 lobbyists and representatives from powerful unions big business and well financed trade associations will continue to buttonhole legislators as they have before
7041965 i thought it was gonna be a free hat or a free meal or something
7041966 it was my second fish and when it was coming up i was kind of laughing because its not real big
7041967 then we thought maybe someone else had hooked it because it had a golden hook in it
7041968 we thumped it in the head to make sure it didnt jump out of the fish box
7041969 ive told this story so many times and every time i have to walk around and shake it off
7041970 right now im pacing around on my deck i am angry thinking about that little fish
7041971 we heard a 2 000 one got caught but the person had no ticket so he threw it back which was great
7041972 we had one 1 000 one caught and paid for
7041973 ive got the experience to be effective in washington d c ive got the proven track record for what i stood up for in juneau and ive been talking about the issue thats most on the minds of alaskans
7041974 i want to be the person who goes to washington d c spreads that word i have the ability to do that i have the will to do it
7041975 i think we have too many career politicians serving in congress and that hasnt benefited the people
7041976 i say lets set the boundaries in campaigns that way youve got a precedent before you even go into office youre not bought
7041977 all people have to do is look at my record im a guy who stood up to corporate influence time and again when i was in the state legislature
7041978 should have some regrets about helping to elect republican frank murkowski
7041979 i did talk to a high powered lobbyist who had done a poll for whoever his client was and the only thing he was willing to tell me is it was extremely close
7041980 i am very strong on civil liberties and veterans with a passion that nobody else has
7041981 democratic house speaker nancy pelosi and her liberal allies will stop at nothing to get don young through the primary so they can win in november with ethan berkowitz
7041982 they want don young and they cant have him because alaskans are going to stand up and elect me for congress
7041983 ill bet you any money you want to bet that i can win the primary and i can beat ethan berkowitz
7041984 i see that our friend don young is here im a little bit surprised i guess he came here to concede the election
7041985 im more physically capable than most people in this room i challenge anybody in this room if they want to go three rounds with me down at sullivan arena
7041986 i think we need a new direction a new voice part of that is because of the diminished effectiveness
7041987 i think you guys are all going to be surprised because i think at the end of the day this election will be an absolute horse race
7041988 it appears as though in this highly unusual and disappointing move that national party democrats feel they can influence the minds and hearts of republicans by spending a little money
7041989 we have no preference as to the republican nominee and are prepared for a vigorous debate with whoever emerges from the republican primary
7041990 every senator and their spouse should detail every nickel of their income
7041991 too numerous to mention as i have frequently used candidacy as a platform to expose corruption
7041992 if im elected to u s senate i will do what i have always done i will bring light and ethics to government
7041993 its more about tearing down people than what alaskans are interested in alaska families are interested in and thats laying out what youre going to do to make a difference
7041994 i think the last time i was here i suggested that this was going to happen and a lot of people were quite skeptical
7041995 that kind of raised his credibility somewhat but it hasnt raised it to the point where he can kind of credibly run for national office theres a big gap there
7041996 weve had no energy plan in congress for 40 years and the crisis we face today is because of that
7041997 at the end of the day its who you surround yourself with what kind of team you have and do you understand how to give directions
7041998 one of the most outstanding candidates for senate in the country
7041999 ive been in the real estate business for 34 years ive never seen anybody pay a real estate commission in the manner that you described it and i dont buy it

7042003 gt barack obama picked notorious blowhard and peter principle posterboy joe biden as his running mate
7042004 not an issue were going to deal with in this campaign
7042005 they created the concept they figured out how to market the hell out of it and before anybody else figured out how to do it they owned it
7042006 many of the people in management and skill positions work very long hours
7042007 you can see mbnas classic yacht affinity its state of the art cruiser impatience as well as its snazzy sportfishing boat so far so good and its power launch deliverance
7042008 senator biden sold his house in delaware at the appraised value
7042009 there was an independent appraisal done by mr cochrans mortgage company
7042010 advised mbna executives which candidates to give to how much to give and when to give it and to send photocopies of their checks to the banks general counsel
7042011 you can give more than with a political action committee
7042012 when you do it in the workplace many people feel there are unwritten rules and certain pressures that can be applied with a wink and a nod
7042013 we all know each other very well we all talk among each other and made our contributions
7042014 you are much less indebted to the 200 electricians who gave you two bucks apiece
7042015 than you are to the 50 du pont family members who gave 2 000 apiece
7042016 is proud of the support he has received from the business community in delaware
7042017 hes a talented young guy that we are grooming for a management position
7042018 i knew the right answer for 30 000 i knew the right answer for 40 000
7042019 cant do without it you need water to be able to sustain the crops as well as sustain our communities

7042025 its inhuman the players cant breathe and its difficult to run the heat is unbearable
7042026 it actually affected both countries and most players did not play to their best abilities because of the heat
7042027 although we dont make the rules and we were told to play i dont think it was a good idea to play at noon
7042028 it was very hard to play we were tired and it was very hot but the energy we had came from knowing that we were playing in the final

7042044 this proposed regulation is about the legal right of a health care professional to practice according to their conscience
7042045 doctors and other health care providers should not be forced to choose between good professional standing and violating their conscience freedom of expression and action should not be surrendered upon the issuance of a health care degree
7042046 many health care providers routinely face pressure to change their medical practice often in direct opposition to their personal convictions
7042047 during my practice as an ob gyn i witnessed this first hand but health care providers shouldnt have to check their conscience at the hospital door this proposed rule will help ensure that doesnt happen

7042050 we are now looking for ways to use a small molecule to either inhibit grk5 from going inside the cells nucleus or to stop its activity once inside the nucleus
7042051 it could be a very novel approach to treating this disease
7042052 our current studies are investing the mechanism of grk5 nuclear entry and we are developing inhibitors to prevent this action
7042053 the novelty of the paper is that a group of kinases traditionally thought to work by turning off receptors at the membrane of a cardiac cell has an alternative function inside the nucleus and is able to directly regulate genes
7042054 while we demonstrated how important this in the heart it probably is working in the same way in other cell types and that is an exciting finding

7042126 another fifteen years have passed since i wrote the preceding sentences but i would now only re emphasize
7042127 i would say that as time has gone on i have been impressed with two fallacies that have crept into the thinking of americans the fallacy that men by weight of numbers can defy the moral law and lean increasingly upon other men under the guise of the state and the fallacy that this dependence is justified by the supposed right of all men to share equally in everything
7042128 it may seem strange in the light of such views that in june of 1954 when the supreme courts desegregation decision burst upon the country i did not react at once surely here was a sharp departure from the past a confusion of equality of opportunity and equality before the law with social and cultural equality as well as a clear challenge to other american principles

7042135 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7042136 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7042137 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone
7042138 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7042139 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7042140 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7042141 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7042142 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
7042143 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
7042144 as you see we just watched felipes qualifying lap and in sector one he destroyed everyone so they will be hard to beat tomorrow but we will push hard to do so
7042145 we knew we had a good car through testing and going into q1 and q2 it was just going through no problem
7042146 the car was great and i went out and i stayed on option tyres for both of q3s timed laps the first one wasnt a great lap i lost about a second compared to the second the second one was quite good for sure there is some time there but it is a solid position to be in for tomorrow
7042147 for sure it is always nice to be on the top after such a bad result especially how it happened
7042148 to have a problem with three laps to go with it completely in my pocket after such a difficult race its very nice to be here after the last problem being at the top
7042149 it is nice to start from pole position and you have more possibilities so lets try to do a great race tomorrow
7042150 we have a good car we showed in the last race but unfortunately sometimes these things can happen and we showed again here that we are competitive that is the most important thing the team did a great job today
7042151 starting on pole for the first time for sure is very nice and the track here is not very easy especially the surface which is a bit slippery so to make the perfect lap is a bit difficult
7042152 i had a good lap so i was able to score pole position i think i have a good car for the race tomorrow it will be difficult but i will try to do my best
7042153 non sai quanto mi piacerebbe ucciderti ma sono felice che lei stia al caldo

7042170 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
7042171 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
7042172 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
7042173 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
7042174 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
7042175 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties
7042176 we served in a war and theyre thumbing their noses at us basically and that makes me feel really sad about this situation
7042177 i could say well go try to cut him to the ground every down but were not going to do that

7042208 the bottom line is that iowa is a grassroots state and its in the rural areas where the roots are deepest
7042209 its the question of what did you do in the war daddy
7042210 now the trumpet summons us again not as a call to bear arms though arms we need not as a call to battle though embattled we are but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle
7042211 surprised the hell out my staff it surprised the hell out of me
7042212 how did we ever allow the republican right to take the high ground on values

7042216 kids keep a thought in their heads for 12 hours
7042217 its a beautiful life that takes work as a dad he rebuilt this family
7042218 i was a 42 year old guy who never really when i started off intended to really run quite frankly i thought more about how to win than how to govern i wasnt nearly as sure as what i wanted to do if i were able to govern today it is almost the opposite unfortunately
7042219 this time rightly or wrongly i am given a fair amount of credit by serious press guys for being ready to be president but theres grave doubt whether i can get the nomination to run for president so its kind of a flip do you know what i mean
7042220 its sort of been liberating i dont feel constrained in this campaign i dont parse my words i dont look at the polls im going to win or lose on my own terms one of the things that last time taught me was the worst way to lose was on somebody elses terms
7042221 they literally had to take the top of my head off twice
7042222 every time i hear i am more and more convinced hes the guy i want in the white house
7042223 theyve convinced themselves that you dont even know whats best for your own members theyve drugged the kool aid
7042224 there would be no middle class in american without the union movement

7042226 plagiarism give me a break i was chair of clinton gore in 92 and we were dealing with gennifer flowers
7042227 they stuck with me when i was being called a lying no good so and so how could i not and i really did not want to go back to sioux city
7042228 when you give up that principle youre just yielding to selfishness the people who got me through are the people who stayed loyal to me
7042229 is how do i survive this i think you are blinded by your despair its kind of like youre getting sucked inside yourself into a black hole except what you really need sometimes you just need to know someone else made it
7042230 i didnt know them i had never met them in my life
7042231 but you know when you have sort of a gift the gift is you survived you know if you give that to somebody it makes you feel worthwhile because people did it for me

7042233 lets see you gotta have former school board president bob donaldson on there
7042234 thats just a no brainer he basically put the whole board on his back in 62 and carried them to their first balanced budget in 35 years
7042235 and if were talking greatest of all time you cant leave off district 4s heidi lieberman
7042236 district advisory committee in 56 school advisory committee in 57 the new school delay and cancellation system in 59 thats a hall of fame career right there
7042237 i know the etling pick will raise a few eyebrows but dont forget she never had a chance to shine because she was a great member on a terrible board
7042238 i often wonder what she wouldve accomplished on a board like the one we had in 72 with the three headed monster of kowalski graham and mediatin mark mendicus
7042239 widmer looked silly trying to vote on gym renovation proposals with the young guns of the 77 board
7042240 if you talk to vice principal harris hell tell you that caldwell should be on everyones dream board
7042241 he was only on the board for one year voted for the construction of the vo tech building then died in a plane crash as far as im concerned his reputation is based more on his mystique than his tangible contributions to the board
7042242 a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7042246 je wilt toch graag op een high eindigen maar dat zat er totaal niet in
7042247 ik vind het triest voor mannen als guus vogels jeroen delmee en teun de nooijer die hebben al drie olympische medailles en willen natuurlijk niet op deze manier afdruipen ook voor coach roelant oltmans is dit een pijnlijk afscheid
7042248 dat realiseer ik me heel goed ik zag ook grote pijn in de ogen van sommige jongens op deze manier wil je niet afdalen van de berg maar australi was tot de tanden gewapend nederland niet dat is toch vreemd want zo vaak in je leven krijg je de kans niet om een olympische medaille te winnen

7042269 things like shooting and rowing most chinese people have never experienced 99 percent of these sports
7042270 in the end all eyes were focused on liu xiang the 110 meter hurdler it seemed that 1 3 billion chinese were all counting on him
7042271 having a standard sports ground in every school is a minimum request
7042272 since i started to practice table tennis at five at the sports school ive never bought myself a racket or a pair of sneakers
7042273 everything has been taken care by the state ive never worried about other things i just focus on playing this sport
7042274 for each olympic gold medal china pays ten times the world average
7042275 the americans know well how to do the right things for their people
7042276 as the possibility of becoming a sage takes root in your heart and mind i see what a glorious future awaits you in old age an opportunity for continued growth in conciousness and service to humanity and so i say lchaim to life to all of you possible sages on the way to your new vocations
7042277 it is ultimately about wins and losses and i certainly understand that
7042278 the fans are passionate for what we do that is fine that is good
7042279 i am very passionate they get very upset when we lose games that we should have won believe me i understand that i am more upset than they are it hurts
7042280 there are things i have to take a step back and take a look at things that we have done well
7042281 you get beat down with all the negatives with all we havent done
7042282 we are a much stabler program than we have been in a long time and getting to a bowl game and having winning seasons is obviously the next part of the progression
7042283 its definitely not going to be an easy task to win the pac 10
7042284 last year we did a good job of winning the games we were supposed to win and we didnt do a good job of winning the games maybe we felt we could have won
7042285 this year we have to take that next step if we want to be talking about the bcs
7042286 i thought i was a little small playing at 205 and i felt i got wore down a little bit toward the end of the year
7042287 i felt if i put on some weight some muscle i could maybe last a little bit longer be stronger toward the end of the season
7042288 part of me loves it because its going to be a great opportunity for us as a university and for us as a football team to show what we can do against some of the best teams in the country
7042289 then again its pretty rough that can be a pretty difficult stretch if we dont take care of business we could be hurting at that time of the year
7042290 its the bar everybody in our league has to get over thats just how it is
7042291 this the first year weve had sophomores that we recruited he said
7042292 were a lot more mature team and a lot bigger we had to get extra pads for our skill guys because they couldnt fit in them
7042293 we had to make changes on defense and we did laslett said
7042294 we can do some different things with our running backs and they can catch the football
7042295 were a lot better up front but theres still a lot of work to be done right now as far as bringing everyone together
7042296 les ann es reagan et bush ont exalt la poursuite du profit priv au d triment de lengagement pour le bien public la satisfaction des int r ts particuliers au d triment du bien commun la richesse et la renomm e au d triment du travail et de la famille les ann es 80 nous firent entrer dans un ge dor de cupidit et d go sme dirresponsabilit et dexc s et de n gligence
7042297 the reagan bush years he bill clinton declared have exalted private gain over public obligation special interests over the common good wealth and fame over work and family the 1980s ushered in a gilded age of greed and selfishness of irresponsibility and excess and of neglect
7042298 el operativo se realizar en forma itinerante en los municipios de zapopan guadalajara tlaquepaque y tonal est bamos saliendo nicamente en el municipio de zapopan porque llev bamos un programa conjunto pero a partir de esta semana estaremos tambi n en los otros municipios
7042299 we were 60th or something like that in the nation in total offense
7042300 we can certainly play a lot better than we did
7042301 there were times i thought we were pretty good and there were times when we were really inconsistent we have to play more consistent and deal with adversity better
7042302 it seems like eight starters are hard to replace but i feel we underachieved as a defense last year
7042303 when we play with high energy and fly around and play hard were going to be successful
7042304 it does not mean we are going to smother everybody but were going to make them earn every yard
7042305 the younger guys are eager and nobody has been here they cant really talk the talk or walk the walk
7042306 every game is a championship game for us so here we go there is great anticipation and i look forward to doing something special
7042307 carpenter spends a lot of time in my office studying the game he loves the game that is what separates himself from a lot of other quarterbacks
7042308 youve got to have support people because the quarterback cant do it on his own
7042309 our receiving corps is different we used to have a lot of smaller speed guys now we have bigger speedy guys
7042310 this system works and the schemes work we have the players to get it done
7042311 every year somebody comes out of the woodwork to make a name for themselves and take them to a place where nobody thought they could go hopefully that is in westwood this year
7042312 im just one guy if the attention is on me and we are still able to score with other people making plays and we are winning that is great i love it
7042313 when i came in we were the weakness of the team and now we are finally the strength a lot of guys had to develop and get better
7042314 the offense tries to find the best way to get people the ball and it allows players to move easily i like learning it as more and more time goes on
7042315 he kept telling us the n stood for not today
7042316 every time we saw that helmet he wanted us to think not today not today you look back at that now and it sounds so corny but that has stuck with me forever and it was very motivating back then
7042317 that game felt different than any game i played in at arizona
7042318 it kind of felt like what i thought the super bowl would feel like it was like the lights were brighter it was different
7042319 it was definitely fun to play in it was probably the most fun i had in a football game
7042320 to this day anywhere i go walking around here in california they bring that game up
7042321 they can tell me more about the game than i can
7042322 the first thing i think about in that game is brad brennans catch
7042323 there was a lot of pressure at that point of the game
7042324 we kind of looked at each other and he broke off his route into a skinny post i knew i had to zip it in there and i threw it as hard as i could
7042325 he split two defenders and was excited to come out of that thing alive
7042326 nebraska was always a team you wanted to play wanted to beat
7042327 it would have been nice to build on that momentum and do better things after that
7042328 if you had told me after the holiday bowl that i wouldnt have gone to another bowl ever again i would have told you you were crazy
7042329 and if you had told me arizona wouldnt go to a bowl in the next nine seasons i would have said jump off a bridge because thats the dumbest thing
7042330 we have exchanged constructive views with each other and will meet again

7042354 the father of disgraced pastor michael guglielmucci has revealed his son has been addicted to pornography since the age of 12
7042355 when michael rang me last tuesday i was on my way to new zealand
7042356 he said dad youve got to come and see me
7042357 i said to my wife maybe the doctors have told him hes only got a few weeks to live
7042358 so we cancelled everything and jumped on the plane and went to see him in melbourne and thats when he told us the story
7042359 we were just in absolute shock and we still are we havent had time to get our head around it he said i dont have cancer ive had two lives that ive lived
7042360 his wife amanda who has been with him for seven years found out the day before we did and shes had no idea
7042361 michael has had a severe addiction to pornography the addiction to pornography started when he was 12
7042362 its horrendous because we dont have that sort of stuff around he was raised in a christian home weve never brought that stuff into our home
7042363 he lived the two lives and he would get sick as a result of the guilt
7042364 he was feeling like he was letting god down letting his family down his church his friends
7042365 hes been living this for so long feeling like hes had these two lives and now hes the one thats come out in the open he confessed it he didnt get caught
7042366 to deal with the guilt he would pour himself into doing good work hes touched the lives of young people all over the world now they are all affected by this
7042367 he hasnt done this for any reasons that have been portrayed that hes a fraud
7042368 it was either keep pretending or come out with the truth and tell everything hes come out with everything but now weve got the consequences of it all
7042369 we have to accept it were hoping to share with our congregation how it all started and how it got where it is
7042370 an addiction like this is not going to be fixed overnight you cant have a 16 year problem and fix it in a week
7042371 they have said to me that he is very ill they are assessing where reality stopped and fantasy kicked in and whats caused all this
7042372 the doctor believes that at times michael was totally convinced that he had this sickness
7042373 when he was about 12 he did vomit all the time hed get really really sick
7042374 he was in the adelaide childrens hospital for seven weeks at one stage he didnt eat and we thought we were going to lose him
7042375 they took out his appendix thinking that it might be that but they realised that it wasnt
7042376 they gave us the option of putting him in a psychiatric ward to see if there was something psychological but we felt uncomfortable with that at the time
7042377 we signed him out from hospital and then he would go a few months and then he would get sick again
7042378 wed always take him to hospital wed always do the proper thing but they couldnt get to the bottom of it until now
7042379 we have watched our son go through what we thought was cancer
7042380 my wife and i over the past two years have watched him vomit in buckets having nosebleeds and even his hair fell out in clumps at one stage
7042381 every time we saw him we saw symptoms he stayed with us for a while where we had to put a special air conditioner in one of the rooms because he would heat up so much in the middle of winter
7042382 he had this cold air conditioner blowing on him to try to keep the heat down as a professional minister ive stood in front of my congregation and cried and said to pray for my son
7042383 ive travelled the world asking people to pray for him can you imagine what a horrible thing it would be if i was playing a game
7042384 to be honest i ask myself as a father what did i miss what did i not do
7042385 if you dont feel youre as close to god as possible raise your hand
7042386 if you feel lonely come to the front for prayer
7042387 if you want more of god this is your time
7042388 if you have struggles and need the answer come down
7042389 examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith
7042390 shortly after 3 am on the east coast the long awaited text message from barack obama announcing joe biden had finally arrived but it was something short of letting the cat out of the bag at 10 50 pm on friday night abc news confirmed that biden was getting secret service protection the first official confirmation that i could find came from cnn at 12 45 a m the promised be the first to know text message came a full two hours later
7042391 couldnt claim any major legislative victories during his tenure as chairman concerning indian country
7042392 he put forward a piece of legislation that would have added more burdensome regulation to our gaming industry at a time when our federal funding was at its lowest point
7042393 we were very disappointed because weve had a long history with sen mccain and i know that if he personally had gotten the message he might have met with us but we couldnt get to him
7042394 sen obamas going to have to meet with tribes on a daily basis to catch up with the 25 years sen mccain has spent on their issues
7042395 i dont think thees anything that even looks like a horse race in terms of intimacy of association and familiarity with the issues
7042396 sen mccain knows us intimately so he knows our strengths as well as our weaknesses so that could play good and bad for us
7042397 we are writing songs with barack and joe in the chorus sing along
7042398 the united nations has always made clear that civilian casualties are unacceptable and undermine the trust and confidence of the afghan people

7042400 nessuno ha criticato linesperienza di barack obama con parole pi aspre di joe biden ha denunciato le sue cattive decisioni in politica estera e ha ribadito quello che gli americani stanno capendo che barack obama non in grado di fare il presidente

7042415 based on a conversation that one of the parties attorneys had with the jury foreperson
7042416 upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jurys deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other jurors mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the jurors mental processes in connection therewith a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jurys attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror only after some outside evidence of that act or event has been presented
7042417 s uch evidence is generally not admissible to impeach a jury verdict unless there is supporting evidence aliunde evidence aliunde is extraneous independent evidence of alleged conduct based on the firsthand knowledge of one who is not a juror franklin fails to argue that any evidence aliunde exists that would impeach the jurys verdict consequently the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying franklins motion

7042426 every day has been a record in terms of the number of trades and the notional value executed but the number is still small
7042427 but weve seen executions in the lit side as well as in the dark pool and weve had executions between the visible and the dark so that begins to validate our market model
7042428 we had something like 10 percent market share in one of the illiquid names where there was a large dark execution
7042429 we expect market making activity to increase steadily as we add more countries and by the middle of september we expect to be in full swing
7042430 i have been saying that i expect to have in the order of 5 percent market share by the end of the year and i think thats a reasonable target
7042431 but internally we have higher aspirations and our goals are even higher than that this is a process and we will learn as we go along but i think that were on track

7042437 i love bill clinton but can you imagine being vice president
7042438 in a barack administration id probably be looked to a whole lot more
7042439 now i dont think he would ask me but i think he would look to me more
7042440 i try to surround myself with people who are about getting the job done and who are not about ego self aggrandizement getting their names in the press
7042441 im not afraid to have folks around me who complement my strengths and who are independent im not a believer in a government of yes men
7042442 a two month search that was conducted almost entirely in secret
7042443 reflect ing a critical strategic choice by mr obama to go with a running mate who could reassure voters about gaps in his r sum rather than to pick someone who could deliver a state or reinforce mr obamas message of change
7042444 biden has been critical of bushs approach to iraq and the world for the right reasons and from the beginning
7042445 republicans are strong on national security and voters needed to be convinced of their failures and then led to a place of support for a democratic alternative
7042446 from the position that republicans have been catastrophic failures on foreign policy and their ongoing claims to competence and leadership should be laughed at
7042447 rudy giuliani is probably the most underqualified man since george bush to seek the presidency
7042448 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else
7042449 he was schooled in senatorial procedure in the days when the senate was less gridlocked if obama hopes to pass energy and health care legislation hes going to need someone with that kind of legislative knowledge who can bring the battered old senators together as in days of yore
7042450 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7042451 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7042452 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7042453 if biden says something off the wall that sticks in everyones mind all the better the worry with biden is that he just cant help himself obama may hope that he just cant stop himself from saying for instance that mccain is a hothead who shouldnt have his finger on the button obama can then denounce his no 2s intemperate remarks even as they sink in this is what veep candidate were put on earth to do
7042454 obama and biden were not close in the senate and biden amazingly has still not formally endorsed him
7042455 but even this could be turned into an advantage as biden encourages wary supporters of hillary clinton
7042456 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7042457 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7042458 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7042459 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7042460 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

7042475 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism

7042477 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7042478 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

7042497 levels are a cheap poor way to provide instant gratifications to the masses that are unable to find other ways to make progress this arbitrary number slapped on the top of a characters head has the ability to render a great majority of game content completely worthless i hate the idea that this number is the sole determination on how strong your character is and what the outcome of the fight will be remove levels and make some games with skill box based systems
7042498 loot based economies essential make time in game take precedence over skill being able to devote more of your life to a game shouldnt mean you automatically dominate those who cant play as much allow player skill to actually play a part in a fight not just how many purples each person has loot also makes people run the same boring awful dungeons over and over again just so they can get that one item to drop loot based systems more often then not make crafting a pointless hobby for the select few that enjoy it very rarely do you see a loot based system with a creative meaningful crafting system remove loot based systems and make crafters the major suppliers

7042593 domain and error page ads accounted for approximately 16 2 of all clicks on plaintiffs ads during his campaign yet did not result in a single person completing the online form on the site or contacting the plaintiff by phone or e mail
7042594 based on the circumstances presented here the panel concludes that respondent has a legitimate interest in the domain name because it used the domain name for a bona fide offering of goods and services with complainants knowledge and acquiescence for several years before any notice of an objection by complainant
7042595 there is no explanation for complainants six years of silence before the 2005 email requesting a trademark acknowledgment

7042604 do you really want to pay for ken livingstone and his cronies
7042605 with two such high profile london mayor candidates like ken livingstone and boris johnson cybersquatters and online speculators are bound to be waiting in the wings to register campaign relevant domains
7042606 thats not possible youre too happy and too cheerful all the time
7042607 do you really want to pay for ken livingstone and his cronies
7042608 it is very hard to stop negative websites and click farms springing up but by leaving obvious domains unregistered the candidates have provided a route for cybersquatters to make money from unsuspecting voters looking for official campaign information

7042610 the practice of registering names especially well known company or brand names as internet domains in the hope of reselling them at a profit
7042611 were sent to a crisis pregnancy center site instead of to the family planning clinic site they were looking for
7042612 initially squatters were just individuals who could be located anywhere by their personal computers theyre still out there but there are also these companies that have invested heavily in technology theyre just canvassing the net by registering hundreds of thousands of domain names and these folks are well funded
7042613 now icann the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers the organization based in california that manages domain names is considering steps to stamp out the practice the board of icann will vote in paris in june on a proposal to severely limit the number of domain names that can be returned without a fee but the organization is facing resistance from domain name registrars who are against ending the grace period

7042658 la separazione delle carriere continua pisapia non consegnera il pm al governo ma ci aiutera sulla strada che porta a un giudice effettivamente terzo e alluguaglianza dei cittadini davanti alla legge ma prima di entrare nel merito devo fare una premessa e giusto che il parlamento ascolti tutte le parti in causa ci mancherebbe ma poi le riforme le devono fare le camere
7042659 per me debbono andare di pari passo ce un nodo importante che se sciolto puo darci efficienza ma senza arretrare sulle garanzie e quello dellobbligatorieta dellazione penale oggi di fatto siamo alla discrezionalita e infatti molti vogliono abolire o limitare lobbligatorieta poi pero ce unaltra riforma decisiva la separazione delle carriere prosegue pisapia su questa non capisco le ire dellanm la separazione delle carriere e prevista in molti paesi scritta nelle convenzioni internazionali ratificate anche dallitalia e un fatto di civilta che chiunque non puo non condividere e arrivato il momento di dividere di qua i pm di la i giudici e una cosa necessaria perche altrimenti il giudice non sara mai terzo fra pm e avvocato fra accusa e difesa il giudice non puo essere sullo stesso piano del pm che e una parte il giudice e questo e un principio fondamentale deve essere e apparire al di sopra delle parti come ribadito recentemente dallo stesso presidente dellanm
7042660 questo rischio non ce assolutamente tutte le proposte che arrivano in questo senso a partire da quella delle camere penali lo escludono esplicitamente il pm puo essere sganciato dal giudice ma mantenere tranquillamente la sua autonomia e la sua indipendenza
7042661 quella del fascismo e una demonizzazione non utile il fatto che lattuale sistema costituzionale della magistratura sia stato votato dopo la fine del fascismo non vuol dire che se viene modificato cio implichera un ritorno al fascismo
7042662 il segretario dellanm cascini ha fatto questo paragone per alzare un muro per alzare le difese il fatto e che per riformare la giustizia bisogna creare il clima giusto e secondo me sarebbe meglio arrivare a dei ritocchi costituzionali solo piu in la dopo aver messo mano ai codici per snellire i processi
7042663 separare le carriere di giudice e pm non nasconde un rischio autoritario dice barbera anzi per separare le carriere non e necessario neppure rivedere la costituzione

7042680 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7042681 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7042682 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7042683 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7042684 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7042685 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7042686 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7042687 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7042688 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
7042689 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow

7042693 als we de stijgende lijn doorzetten dan gaat het een leuke dag worden aanstaande zaterdag hoewel ik niet een fan ben van zon lange competitie onderbreking zit het met de vorm wel goed de oefenpotjes van afgelopen weken heb ik ontspannen afgewerkt de service en volley lopen al weken lekker de return begint nu ook eindelijk vorm te krijgen
7042694 ik hoop zaterdag lekker ontspannen te tennissen dan gaat het vanzelf goed lopen met mijn spel we zullen nog een beetje puzzelen met de opstelling maar ik heb er weer superveel zin in
7042695 we kunnen goede zaken doen zaterdag maar laten we vooral de tegenstander niet onderschatten we zullen ook moeten laten zien dat we niet alleen in thuiswedstrijden kunnen winnen persoonlijk loopt het allemaal vrij soepel op de baan af en toe is de volley nog niet helemaal zoals ik wil maar dat is een kwestie van tijd
7042696 tja hij was gewoon beter maar ondanks dat ik zelf ook prima speelde ben ik deze competitie wel klaar met het singelen
7042697 overall gezien een goede pot we serveerden beiden sterk en in de rallies hebben we dwingend gespeeld vooral in de eerste set ging werkelijks niets fout
7042698 wat een klote partij een soort van off day leek het wel ik bewoog niet goed de slagen al helemaal niet tja dan blijft er weinig over aldus kruit na afloop
7042699 zuur is dit de eerste set was vrij dramatisch in de 2 e set kregen we uiteindelijk nog setpunten dus achteraf ook nog kansen laten liggen dit is een dure nederlaag
7042700 dit was mijn eerste partij op gravel na wekenlang in de snelle hal geharkt te hebben moest ik enorm wennen
7042701 het was goed om te zien dat de uren in de hal zijn vruchten hebben afgeworpen aldus huisman
7042702 loodzware partij het was ook vrij benauwd en voor elk punt moest er geknokt worden jammer dat ik het in de 3
7042703 lekker om 2 potjes te winnen vandaag wel jammer dat zij niet meer serieus speelden op het eind
7042704 comprehensive principled yet practical solution to securing the borders winning the war on drugs and ending illegal immigration
7042705 we have a rare situation in our national political landscape where both major party candidates for president refuse to address a top national issue thats vitally important to the american people over 80 of americans want border security yet we havent heard word one from either obama or mccain on what theyll do as president to materially secure our borders and protect our national security and sovereignty
7042706 we refuse to let them sweep this critical issue under the carpet while american cities and towns are overrun by drug cartels organized crime 3rd world diseases and economic instability were going to hold their feet to the fire
7042707 siempre me he sentido uno m s y lo sigo siendo

7042718 college instructors are finding more and more quality online content for their classes and the psych files is unique in that it is aimed at students majoring in the soft sciences not just the techies and computer science majors who are typical consumers of podcasts
7042719 i try to show listeners how even complex theories can be readily understood and how these ideas can have an impact on their daily lives
7042720 indrukwekkend deze gasten iedereen wist dat het erin zat maar nu lijkt afgelopen zaterdag iets losgemaakt te hebben en hebben ze als team een grote stap voorwaarts gemaakt
7042721 i was working out at apple rehab and noticed that suddenly i couldnt see out of my right eye
7042722 i was living my life exactly as always but i had a feeling that i would lose the sight in my other eye
7042723 i was working on beading medieval era jewelry and i felt i needed to get it done but i didnt even though the doctor said it would be extremely rare for this to happen in the other eye i just keep thinking it would happen
7042724 i took my first sabbatical in the fall of 2007 to study medieval arts
7042725 i was in washington d c the first week in november my vision was gone and it was the end of my sabbatical
7042726 i couldnt read anything couldnt use the computer making a cup of coffee is just making a mess i couldnt cut my fingernails and i had no idea what was in the cans on the shelf
7042727 i went through the stage of being angry because other people do simple ordinary everyday things i no longer could do
7042728 she learned many things including how to cook safely move about the community and use public transportation and she dealt with feelings about vision loss in counseling and much more
7042729 our programs are custom designed for each student so when lynda expressed an interest in continuing her sewing the coordinator of personal adjustment to blindness training got out the sewing machine and taught lynda how to sew despite her vision loss she made a beautiful skirt that she often wore to classes
7042730 there were six of us in the room and no two people were doing anything alike and the teacher could function on all these tasks from one to the other with ease
7042731 i knew i was in trouble and this was definitely not a vacation i realized where i was with all these others who were also struggling to learn and i was below kindergarten it was like being on another planet i was in a special education class it was a traumatic experience
7042732 i have always enjoyed the opportunity to learn something i know nothing about and im excited about learning in a new way
7042733 i try to think of my situation as an opportunity to learn and how to adjust
7042734 i learn to try more and different ways and find what will work
7042735 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7042736 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7042737 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7042738 the truth and genius and virtue of strom thurmond is what i choose and we all choose to remember today
7042739 for decades biden has been at the forefront of the war on drugs
7042740 are you now or have you ever been a racist
7042741 obama says that black americans have nothing to be shocked or indignant about themselves any longer perhaps black americans are entitled to be angry about the past but they shouldnt be too angry yes terrible injustices were committed but thats all behind us now now we can comfortably move into a post racial future
7042742 the festival is a great way for the public to enjoy some of the best caesar salad in the world and taste the blending of unique flavors that have made tijuanas cuisine so exciting not just now but for decades
7042743 were also proud not just for being the city with the first caesar salad but having the record of creating the biggest one in the world
7042744 in the last 6 olympic games there is an average 19 12 increase in the hosting countries stock indexes in the six months following the games in the 12 month after the olympics the stock indexes had a strong 26 14 average increase
7042745 these factors caused the increase on the stock market 6 months after the sporting event
7042746 the infrastructure construction system establishment and environmental protection among others for the olympics gave a lasting boost to the hosting countries economy therefore although gdp growth in those hosting countries showed a certain degree of slow down generally speaking the hosting countries economy maintained a relatively high speed of growth whats more the reduction of bubbles in the post olympics capital market has typically ensured steady and benign growth history clearing indicates that the lasting winner of the beijing olympics will be the beijing economy
7042747 the enormous changes that took place in china over the past 30 years have given people of the world more imagination and expectation about china
7042748 the gold in beijing this year will won by savvy investors as well as athletes
7042749 would be wise to follow their financial markets as well
7042750 our relationship with usa gymnastics goes back to our first national team contract in 1989 which led to our very first olympic involvement in 1992 at the games in barcelona spain

7042752 hij liet zich gek maken en ik ging onverstoorbaar door
7042753 service volley smash return etc er ging eigenlijk weinig fout in deze partij
7042754 lots of people from abroad say they are more positive now that theyve seen beijing for themselves the games are going really well and the citys cleaner more beautiful and more modern than they thought
7042755 chinas image abroad is too negative and that doesnt reflect reality
7042756 you yourself wouldnt like it if your country was always given bad coverage in the media
7042757 china wants to play its part on the world stage and needs the wests approval the western media play an important part in this
7042758 it ignored all the improvements implemented by the government the modern developments in the capital which are a source of pride to most beijing residents
7042759 the focus has changed from chinese society to sport and there is room for praise for example of the opening ceremony chinas state television cctv has featured elaborate reports about how positive the washington post and cnn were
7042760 and that is now sport which means my life has become nice and quiet
7042761 criticism is an integral part of journalism you write about things which are contentious the government position and that of someone who is fighting against the government that is not defamation that is journalism
7042762 we grow up in a society in which people concentrate on the things which have got better that makes people feel good in other countries you grow up with a more critical view
7042763 e un bel ripartire se stiamo a giocarci una coppa con linter segno che abbiamo fatto molto bene nella stagione passata meritiamo questo tipo di serate nonostante le difficolt allinizio di preparazione la roma pronta per il confronto
7042764 noi come rispetto al presidente noi non possiamo che dargli il massimo dellimpegno noi gli dedicheremo questo sempre nel rispetto delle regole prima limpegno poi si vede
7042765 gli abbiamo chiesto se fosse stato disponibile per una situazione come la nostra cera ci ha fatto piacere ma le differenze sono incolmabili tenteremo di completare la squadra per gli impegni che saranno a lungo termine comunque noi i calciatori buoni ce li avevamo gi da prima
7042766 si cerca di stare attenti a quelle che sono le qualit del calciatore per far funzionare tutto anche il giocatore si deve sacrificare per le necessit della squadra lo abbiamo preso perch pu ricoprire pi ruoli e veloce e potente i buoni calciatori alla fine rendono
7042767 non credo riise sa fare il suo ruolo baptista si mette a disposizione della squadra
7042768 noi dobbiamo valutare la situazione sempre in base alle necessit al completamento della rosa i nomi se ne possono fare tanti rimaniamo sul discorso generico
7042769 ha ancora un problemino a livello muscolare ancora non si pu dire quando potr rientrare lo staff medico pi bravo di me ad analizzare la situazione
7042770 lho visto in difficolt a livello fisico stamane uscito prima della fine dellallenamento ora valuter bene domani la situazione
7042771 non si pu mai sapere noi abbiamo un tetto ingaggi che va rispettato
7042772 si sono sempre gli stessi moduli quello che cambia il vertice basso o il trequartista quello usato in questi tre anni
7042773 si riferisce a menez lui un calciatore che seguiamo ha caratteristiche di esterno ha una corsa importante e che un giocatore che abbiamo guardato ma noi dobbiamo giocare una competizione domani e concentriamoci su quello
7042774 se si va a valutare quello che fa mourinho non credo che sar un problema per i suoi calciatori esprimersi in unamichevole ha giocato con ill 4 4 2 con adriano e ibra
7042775 e positivo che il ragazzo abbia questa voglia ma il ragazzo deve essere messo in condizione di dare un apporto per la squadra la prima valutazione sta allallenatore e ora non in condizione di dare un contributo alla squadra
7042776 anche lei smania riferito al cronista ndr ma bisogna vedere anche la sua condizione se si vuol vincere importante il comportamento non chi gioca o chi no
7042777 c anche vucinic che la prima punta la sapr fare c francesco valuteremo cosa sapr essere pi utile alla squadra
7042778 e stata sempre una nostra caratteristica di trovare calciatori duttili e di livello ladattabilit pu rappresentare un vantaggio per noi
7042779 e chiaro che riise e baptista da questo punto di vista qualcosa in pi ci danno
7042780 io non ho cercato di isolarla da quanto accaduto era giusto cos che i giocatori partecipassero a questo sentimento collettivo abbiamo visto che passione e trasporto c con il gruppo

7042798 even if the goal of withdrawing combat troops by 2011 is realized the accord does leave open the possibility that american military trainers and support forces could remain in iraq after that time it is unclear whether the accord provides for semipermanent military bases in the country and what role the united states would play in providing air and naval support for iraq

7042802 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7042803 i figure people drift toward liberalism at a young age and i always hope that they change when they see how the world really is
7042804 im disappointed that sen clinton wont be the vice presidential nominee
7042805 obviously this was a personal choice for sen obama ill it was his and his alone but i would have loved to have had the opportunity to vote for her this fall hillary clinton would have brought a lot to the table a wealth of knowledge and experience about both campaigning and governing 18 million enthusiastic supporters and a ready and willing volunteer base
7042806 can obama afford to give up 21 percent of the vote
7042807 is they want to make sure he is doing everything in his power to show his respect for her as a candidate and for the issues and the policies that she stands for
7042808 one of the ways he could have done that is as his vice president but its not the only way
7042809 he has to be able to convey in a very convincing way to the public that he understands what drew people to her candidacy whether it was the historical nature of it or her grit and determination or her standing up for working people
7042810 running for president will enable her to do the things she has always wanted to do perhaps with more freedom that if she was in the white house
7042811 her supporters are sticking with her and will be a big part of her effectiveness
7042812 i see her roaring back to the senate taking theses supporters and taking these issues with her
7042813 she is poised to have an impact on public life that parallels u s sen ted kennedy
7042814 i dont think anyone in this state will be under any allusions to what that means

7042927 i had always been interested in cars but i couldnt afford to buy the components that i wanted for the car so im pretty much self taught on everything i just started learning how to weld and how to fabricate and i used my car as a template
7042928 some of the parts that i built helped it to get better traction at the track
7042929 it was safer and i made the suspension adjustable its not adjustable from the factory

7042943 he competido muy bien he sabido estar en todo momento no he fallado nada he dado lo m ximo que pod a dar y el diploma ha compensado el esfuerzo y el sacrificio hecho
7042944 creo que merec a esto y lo dudaba y en el momento en el que ten a que estar he estado y muy bien el p blico ha estado muy bien a pesar de que he quitado uno de los puestos a la competidora china
7042945 es un cierre a mi carrera deportiva muy feliz y con un broche final muy bonito

7042971 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7042972 i think when people are looking at the olympics in 2012 britain home of football where football was invented which we gave to the world i think people would be very surprised if there is an olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it
7042973 i am determined to work with the football associations and the olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing
7042974 he is out of touch with the overwhelming views of football supporters throughout the uk
7042975 all the national supporters groups oppose this move and see it as a threat to the status of their nations to field independent football squads
7042976 not only do all the national supporters associations oppose such a move but the majority of football associations in the uk have said they do not want to take part in a single uk team as it could threaten their existence within fifa
7042977 instead of trying to brow beat the sfa the ifa and the football association of wales into a single team gordon brown should abandon his campaign which threatens the identity of each of the home associations and their national squads
7042978 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage

7042998 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7042999 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7043000 americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken washington arent going to find them on the obama biden ticket in joe biden barack obama has not only found a running mate who doesnt believe hes ready to be president hes proven his opposition to an all of the above energy reform strategy to lower fuel costs for families and small businesses
7043001 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7043002 with a lifetime lcv environmental score of 83 joe biden recognizes that ending our addiction to oil is vital to our national security senator biden is a long time leader on key energy and environmental issues and the members of lcv enthusiastically support senator obamas choice
7043003 behind the olympics theres a whole other race going on

7043021 a continuation of the confrontation with the iranian people but in a new guise
7043022 the iranian nation needs to defend its rights its interests
7043023 but if the approach changes we will be facing a new situation and the response by the iranian people will be a positive one
7043024 ultimately weve been hearing some different things from out of iran
7043025 what were looking for is at the end of the two weeks a definitive statement on where the iranians stand i dont believe weve received that definitive statement yet
7043026 they submitted a package and we responded by submitting our own package they again submitted a work plan and we submitted our own work plan
7043027 its very natural in the first steps we are going to negotiate the common ground as it exists inside the two packages
7043028 if the two parties succeed in agreeing over the common ground that will help us to work on our differences as well to reach an agreement
7043029 the main question here is whether this approach is the continuation of the old approach or is it a totally new approach
7043030 we know that a hands off approach has isolated us and strengthened iran
7043031 the administrations decision to reverse course and join direct talks with tehran is the right one however late while the united states has remained on the sidelines and outsourced our diplomacy to europe iran used that time to continue to master the nuclear fuel cycle and get closer to a nuclear weapons capability even if direct dialogue fails to reach an agreement we will be armed with new leverage that strengthens our hand with europe russia and china to impose tougher sanctions and begin to reverse this dynamic
7043032 i am pleased that the administration seems to be more open to engaging with the people of iran
7043033 this sends a more positive message about our objectives and should enhance our ability to understand the political dynamics in tehran something that is sorely missing today if iranians are able to interact with americans on a more regular and consistent basis they will be less likely to believe the negative rhetoric promoted by their government
7043034 american strength in part resonates from our openness and visibility overseas
7043035 a robust international presence helps facilitate understanding between peoples and provides our diplomats with a far greater understanding of complex international situations while we continue to work with our allies to put a halt to irans nuclear weapons program we should also reach out directly to the iranian people and expand americas diplomatic presence in this vital region of the world
7043036 opening an interests section would give the united states a formal diplomatic presence in iran and would be a positive step for two countries that have not had a diplomatic relationship for 30 years now
7043037 i strongly support a robust diplomatic effort with iran and opening an interests section would be a step in the right direction it would increase direct contacts between the american and iranian people assist iranians wishing to travel to the united states and improve our understanding or iranian society i strongly support this move
7043038 an interests section in iran would provide the base for diplomatic efforts with the iranian public that has been missing for nearly 30 years
7043039 it would facilitate travel encourage an exchange of ideas and allow us to communicate our common values with the people despite our many differences with their government it would also help us to better understand a country whose fate is so intertwined with our own national security i urge the president to move forward with laying this important diplomatic groundwork because the stakes are simply too high not to
7043040 w e are determined to find ways to reach out to the iranian people
7043041 i would like to clear the air on some things but do not know how to go about doing it as some of it is exactly opposite of what has been portrayed on the news but this is what happens when you dont have the money to pay for proper representation i always tell everybody if they want the
7043042 if you had to be down there and get up every morning as hot and humid as it is knowing that you are going to spend the rest of your life locked up under those conditions thats punishment thats what i think my son would want for him
7043043 it affected both countries and most players did not play to their abilities because of the heat

7043046 i knew even before we got here that this would be a worthwhile experience

7043060 no the shark was probably just curious and took a bite at the cable just to see what it was you know sharks are always biting things
7043061 this shark isnt just some rare species its supposed to be extinct megalodon ancestor to the great white shark it can grow in excess of seventy five feet long

7043086 if the government isnt willing to talk to people then the people need to be willing to talk to each other
7043087 it comes from a belief in the nature of security its not about weapons fear and posturing on the world stage its about communication talking to people everyone having their basic needs met if you understood security that way youd see that security is about dialogue
7043088 pledged to find a way of working for peace even though their countries were at war
7043089 our determination was to do something different than go out in the streets which we did for iraq
7043090 we wanted to give a message to iranians to let them know there are lots of us here who believe in peace
7043091 we wore pins written in farsi we are part of a peace delegation
7043092 and people just had this big warm smile they wanted to give us hugs and shake our hands we love americans they told us that day after day

7043118 with their family and in their community in san francisco
7043119 we are saying we should treat juveniles as juveniles regardless of their status
7043120 we had a hearing we had a roomful of different organizations representing various immigrant groups from people dealing with juvenile law
7043121 what happened in that unfortunate murder case created a lot of political debate but in the end you cannot make a blanket policy to treat all juveniles the same
7043122 we shouldnt be punishing everyone because of one case where we had a breakdown in the system
7043123 i dont think hes ready to be our closer i think bronson arroyo would be our best choice as a closer thats if mike timlins not it

7043144 biden failed to reap the benefits of public confession even though he called himself stupid and his actions a mistake part of the problem is that he contradicted himself by also insisting that it was ludicrous to attribute every political idea

7043273 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
7043274 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
7043275 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
7043276 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
7043277 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
7043278 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
7043279 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
7043280 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
7043281 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
7043282 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
7043283 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
7043284 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
7043285 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
7043286 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
7043287 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
7043288 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
7043289 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
7043290 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
7043291 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
7043292 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
7043293 we cannot and will not pretend that the eu will continue doing business as usual with moscow this aggression has damaged the eu russian partnership
7043294 the eu should evaluate whether it is possible to continue in an unaltered way the post pca talks negotiations on a new eu russia treaty visa dialogue or other cooperation activities
7043295 we have seen some disagreements between eu member states on many occasions including the georgia issue still it does not create a deep rift
7043296 nato refusing to grant a map membership action plan for georgia and ukraine at the bucharest summit made a principle mistake we can say that it partly led to the situation that we have in georgia today
7043297 by giving a map to georgia and to ukraine we would clearly show to russia how unhelpful it is to even try flexing its muscles
7043298 the eu visa facilitation issue for georgia will have to be raised further as well as a preparation of a comprehensive free trade agreement
7043299 we are against cruelty we are against ethnic cleansing a right to come back home should be guaranteed to the refugees we all agree that murders property destruction annihilation of culture and religion are not to be tolerated that is what we are fighting against bombardments of the aggressor will be mercilessly intensified
7043300 we appeal to all free countries to join us but our actions are not determined by others i will defend the freedom and security of my citizens whatever actions are needed for it our special forces have seized airports and bridges air forces and missiles have struck essential targets
7043301 take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the area
7043302 team of 15 civil emergency planning experts to help georgia assess damage to its civil infrastructure
7043303 support the re establishment of the air traffic system and assist the georgian government in understanding the nature of cyber attacks
7043304 on the whole all of these threats that have been raining down on russia turned out to be empty words
7043305 i think we should still engage with the russians but in a hard headed way and we mustnt allow the russians to feel they are the victims of this affair when they are the transgressors
7043306 for the withdrawal of russian troops to happen two things are necessary the pullback of georgian forces to their barracks and secondly we need to be assured that our peacekeepers are not going to be attacked again russias ambassador to the united nations vitaly churkin said
7043307 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery

7043313 lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed
7043314 and the scribes and pharisees began to think saying who is this who speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
7043315 i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
7043316 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
7043317 the lords words to the apostle peter in matthew 16 19 as to binding and to all the disciples in 18 18 signify in the former case that the apostle by his ministry of the word of life would keep unbelievers outside the kingdom of god and admit those who believed
7043318 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
7043319 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3 000 souls
7043320 to him christ give all the prophets witness that through his christs name whosoever believeth in him christ shall receive remission of sins
7043321 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
7043322 depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
7043323 god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar
7043324 come now and let us reason together and has said in so many words herself that her eyes and ears are closed she is not ready and so we can only pray for her at this point and i have done so

7043327 on may 13 1981 within three weeks of that private papal conference to fire arrupe john paul ii was struck by two bullets from the browning semiautomatic pistol of paid hitman mehmet ali agca by mistake as it was later explained the pontiff was rushed to the roman hospital of gemelli rather than to the special hospital unit organized solely for papal use he was given blood from the public blood bank the private supply kept in readiness was never used in rapid succession pope john paul underwent two major operations and suffered the consequences of the transfusion of impure blood he contracted a severe case of hepatitis at the height of the pontiffs crisis on may 28 cardinal wyszynski of warsaw died wyszynski was john pauls closest friend and had made his career
7043328 in some respects the meeting that convened in the middle of spring 1981 bore the marks of thousands of board meetings going on at the same moment in every daylight country of the world beyond glass paneled double doors a conference between seven men was in progress a folder bulging with reports lay in front of each man at each mans elbow a full carafe of water topped with a glass was perched anyone happening to glance in might have said that the men gathered there were absorbed in the sort of hushed but free wheeling discussion typical of board meetings everywhere but this was not the sort of meeting most people have ever witnessed or even glimpsed through shut glass paneled doors this conference room was on the third floor of the palace of the popes on vatican hill the report folders were red damask and emblazoned in gold with the tiara and keys outside the door a secretary and two swiss guards in traditional uniform were on duty to block all intruders seated at the conference table were the pontiff of the holy roman catholic church and six of his most powerful cardinals the movers and shakers of the vatican a cameo of its most formidable strength and the subject of discussion between them was the life or death of the society of jesus whether in other words the order headed by father general pedro arrupe should be allowed to go on as it was or be reorganized and reset according to the often repeated wishes of three popes or be officially done to death by the power and under the authority of pope john paul ii
7043329 a summary of this material was made generally available through the associated press which published the following short note on march 31
7043330 soon after the conclave the new pope had a talk with the 20 cardinals from latin america and was deeply impressed by the fact that most of them supported liberation theology
7043331 on the basis of paul vis critical dossier and with the help of a very experienced old jesuit father paolo dezza who had been confessor to pope paul vi and now was john paul is confessor the pope composed a hard hitting speech of warning
7043332 let it not happen that the teachings and publications of jesuits contain anything to cause confusion among the faithful
7043333 paul meanwhile was in desperate need of help of all sorts his health had been deteriorating in an operation that took place on the fourth floor of the apostolic palace in november of 1967 the pontiffs prostate gland was removed contrary to rumors there had been no metastasis more miseries of the mortal kind came from the extremely arthritic condition of pauls legs and from his cervical arthritis that last condition forced him to wear a stiff collar beneath his robes in order to lessen the pain a circumstance that saved his life during his visit to manila the kris wielded by the bolivian painter and would be papal assassin benjamin amor y mendoza was sharp enough to have severed pauls jugular veins as mendoza slashed twice once to the right and once to the left side of pauls neck had it not been for that stiff collar and the speed of pauls private secretary monsignore macchi who caught mendozas arm and slowed its force paul would have been killed as it was he was wounded slightly on both sides of the neck

7043350 we are extremely happy to be working with the columbus blue jackets and syracuse crunch because as an organization they believe in developing their prospects the right way and thats what we strive for here
7043351 one thing also makes it an attractive partnership is the two echl teams that columbus and syracuse worked with last had great success elmira finished second in the division last year and was one game away from the division finals and the year before that dayton made it to the kelly cup finals our fans should be thrilled to bet getting these guys into chiefs jerseys because they are proven winners
7043352 we are very excited to be partnering with the chiefs this year developing players is crucial to the long term success of any team and we feel johnstown will be a positive place for our young players to learn the game and gain professional experience

7043362 en el tema del impuesto al combustible no logro entender por qu no se produce una rebaja mayor porque como lo expres el mismo ministro ayer esto no s lo permite aliviar el bolsillo de los chilenos sino que tambi n permite descomprimir la fuerte presi n que tienen los combustibles en el ipc
7043363 yo creo que es posible todav a insistir en una rebaja mayor porque la rebaja de una utm va a significar de 30 35 pesos menos en circunstancias que es posible bajarlo en 150 pesos

7043389 i dont think that was anticipated i dont think she was too enthused about it
7043390 under obamas need for someone who has vast experience in foreign relations and foreign affairs hes it
7043391 i suggested back right after our primary and after sen obama had clinched the nomination that i thought it would be a smart decision to put hillary clinton on there as his vice presidential candidate
7043392 i think that would be an extremely strong ticket especially here in kentucky once you get by sen clinton im not smart enough to figure out all the national politics of it and ill leave that up to sen obama
7043393 i think shes the most prepared to be vice president
7043394 but if youre looking just at the crass politics of it its the game changer for us it would send the message ok this is how were going to win it with a unified party
7043395 i just hope the obama camp is looking at what is the most strategic step he can make to win not just what hes most comfortable with
7043396 joe biden has incredible national respect on foriegn policy issues and adds gravitas and maturity to the ticket

7043407 this kind of uniformity brings beauty we chinese can do it too
7043408 our program had the highest level of political review since the founding of the peoples republic of china basically all reviews were from the central committee
7043409 we dont see any sign by the chinese leadership that it wants to establish genuine political reform its obvious that the party has no intention of accepting any diminution of its monopoly on power

7043567 in the latter part of this century or the next mexicans will be a majority in many of the states and could therefore take control of the state government using the democratic process

7043592 willen we even stil zijn wat is het sommetje dat je moet maken benjamin even opletten bij de toets moet je het goede sommetje opschrijven
7043593 nou en dat had je vanochtend al af moeten hebben
7043594 are you going to try to make things work or spend your days down in the dirt
7043595 now you are being forced and you will never see a magistrate now youll never see the light of day again
7043596 are you saying that the language used in these legalities is so deceptive that i will be unable to understand them
7043597 the faculty of imagination is the great spring of human activity and the principal source of human improvement destroy this faculty and the condition of man will become as stationary as that of the brutes
7043598 i must contract my shoulder muscles to elevate my arm now i must contract by triceps to extend my arm etc
7043599 the degree to which the cigarettes are not picked up
7043600 i think that our gadget conscious public has shown an unawareness of the special advantages and special disadvantages of electronic machinery as compared with the human brain
7043601 the number of switching devices in the human brain vastly exceeds the number in any computing machine yet developed or even thought of for design in the near future
7043602 the reality of the phenomena must be regarded as proved as certainly as anything in scientific research can be proved
7043603 that there is a capacity for acquiring knowledge that transcends the sensory functions this extra sensory capacity can give us knowledge certainly of objective and very likely of subjective states knowledge of matter and most probably of minds
7043604 once a scientist attacks a problem which he knows to have an answer his entire attitude is changed he is already some fifty per cent of his way toward that answer
7043605 he had been striving to decipher the somewhat obscure impression of a fossil fish on the stone slab in which it was preserved
7043606 he went early to the jardin des plantes thinking that on looking anew at the impression he would see something to put him on the track of his vision
7043607 towards morning the fish reappeared in his dream confusedly at first but at last with such distinctness that he no longer had any doubt as to its zoological characters
7043608 in the morning he was surprised to see in his nocturnal sketch features which he thought it impossible the fossil itself would reveal he hastened to the jardin des plantes and with his drawing as a guide succeeded in chiseling away the surface of the stone under which portions of the fish proved to be hidden when wholly exposed the fossil corresponded with his dream and his drawing and he succeeded in classifying it with ease

7043617 the lads are disappointed but arsenal played to a very high standard
7043618 on october 21 1948 the government of israel took a decision that was to have a lasting and divisive effect on the rights and status of those arabs who lived within its borders the official establishment of military government in the areas where most of the inhabitants were arabs
7043619 the treatment of the palestinian arabs in 1947 and 1948 was as morally indefensible as the slaughter of six million jews by the nazis though nor comparable in quantity to the crimes of the nazis it was comparable in quality
7043620 it was not as though there was a palestinian people in palestine and we came and threw them out and took their country away from them they did not exist
7043621 which sought to establish two nations in the land of israel
7043622 when we complete the permanent agreement we will hold 78 percent of the land while the palestinians will control 22 percent
7043623 documented indiscriminate beating tear gassing and shooting of children at home or just outside the house playing in the street who were sitting in the classroom or going to the store for groceries
7043624 our task is to recreate a barrier and once again put the fear of death into the arabs of the area
7043625 save the children concluded that one third of beaten children were under ten years old and one fifth under the age of five nearly a third of the children beaten suffered broken bones
7043626 we got orders to knock on every door enter and take out all the males the younger ones we lined up with their faces against the wall and soldiers beat them with billy clubs this was no private initiative these were orders from our company commander after one soldier finished beating a detainee another soldier called him you nazi and the first man shot back you bleeding heart when one soldier tried to stop another from beating an arab for no reason a fist fight broke out
7043627 israeli interrogators routinely ill treat and torture arab prisoners prisoners are hooded or blindfolded and are hung by their wrists for long periods most are struck in the genitals or in other ways sexually abused most are sexually assaulted others are administered electric shock
7043628 there is no country in the world in which the use of official and sustained torture is as well established and documented as in the case of israel
7043629 upon arrest a detainee undergoes a period of starvation deprivation of sleep by organized methods and prolonged periods during which the prisoner is made to stand with his hands cuffed and raised a filthy sack covering the head prisoners are dragged on the ground beaten with objects kicked stripped and placed under ice cold showers
7043630 thomas are reminds me of dietrich bonhoeffer an active pastor who comes to the unsettling realization that he and his people have been fed a terrible lie that is killing and torturing thousands of innocent men women and children not without ample research and prayer does such a pastor in turn risk unsettling his congregation the reverend are has done his homework and i suspect has prayed often and long during the writing of this courageous book
7043631 this book will make the reader squirm it asks you to lend your voice in behalf of the voiceless
7043632 we cannot allow others to dictate our thinking on any subject especially on anything as important as christian faithfulness which is tested by an attitude towards seeking justice for the oppressed its a christians duty to know
7043633 speak up for the palestinians and you will make enemies yet as christians we must be willing to raise issues that until now we have chosen to dodge
7043634 i dont think playing finals or not playing finals makes a difference
7043635 if theyre out of contract and theres an opportunity well assess any player in the afl
7043636 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7043637 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7043638 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7043639 hingga saat ini kita masih menunggu perintah untuk mempersiapkan segala sesuatu yang berkaitan dengan eksekusi amrozi dan kawan kawannya

7043642 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
7043643 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
7043644 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death

7043646 37 pounds you add liquid to it its another 2 or 3 pounds
7043647 i know i bring it with the wrong team but at least i brought it home
7043648 its going to be exciting i was sitting here envisioning what it would look like with a hockey rink on the field
7043649 i know theyve played football here in the past its going to be special especially with me being from chicago getting to be a part of history
7043650 you dont want to hurt anybodys feelings ive found a new home with detroit but chicago is always going to be home and my parents are here
7043651 i intend on coming back here someday and living the rest of my days whether its as a player or just somehow maybe involved with the blackhawks
7043652 theyve got a great young nucleus with this team and the management with what theyve done is just tremendous for the fans its been a long time coming since you felt that buzz i cant say i wish i was a part of it right now because im a red wing but its great to see the fans excited about blackhawks hockey
7043653 a 747 carrier operated by virgin atlantic did make a precautionary landing after the pilot reported a technical problem
7043654 it was a precautionary measure by the pilot they take safety as a priority
7043655 we saw that sporting events can be fertile ground for illegal alcohol sales and that the seats provide an especially high risk environment at events that every year attract an average of 130 million people
7043656 we know already that theres a link between alcohol use and problem behaviors among fans
7043657 but theres more that sports stadiums can do to prevent sales to people who are clearly drunk if people are intoxicated we dont need them to consume more alcohol
7043658 combining thousands of fans with significant alcohol sales could be construed as a recipe for some serious problems like increased instances of violence and drunk driving
7043659 given the results of this study stadium management and local and state elected officials may want to consider banning or restricting alcohol sales in the stands at sporting events as some stadiums have already done
7043660 however if such a policy is not politically feasible in a particular stadium vendors in the stands may need to receive additional training regarding responsible service of alcohol training that could include how to check age identification and more clearly recognize signs of obvious intoxication
7043661 in addition law enforcement and community groups need to actively monitor and work with stadiums to promote responsible alcohol service at these events
7043662 why are you mentioning hrithik here ach bhai hrithik bahut bada star hai

7043674 not sure what exactly to tell you about his outing i never saw him hit 94 or 95 mph but he seemed to be comfortably sitting around 91 93 which isnt bad for him those night of 94 95 were a little more than usual he threw a few changeups that i thought were good and his curveball was occasionally outstanding but no doubt about it he got knocked around probably a matter of being too much over the plate just like last time
7043675 mit sicherheit ist es immer sch n nach einem solch blen ergebnis an der spitze zu stehen besonders angesichts der art und weise wie es passierte

7043677 wir verf gen ber ein gutes auto wir haben dies schon im vergangenen rennen gezeigt aber ungl cklicherweise k nnen solche dinge passieren wir haben hier wieder gezeigt dass wir konkurrenzf hig sind das ist das wichtigste das team hat heute gro artige arbeit geleistet
7043678 hier zum ersten mal von der pole position zu starten ist mit sicherheit sehr sch n und die strecke hier ist nicht sehr einfach besonders der asphalt welcher etwas rutschig ist es ist aus diesem grund knifflig eine perfekte runde hinzubekommen ich hatte eine gute runde ich war aus diesem grund in der lage die pole position zu holen ich denke dass wir f r das rennen morgen ein gutes auto haben es wird schwierig werden aber ich werde versuchen mein bestes zu geben

7043722 this incident occurred prior to the canada wide recall of certain maple leaf products
7043723 we had a death from hastings prince edward counties someone who weve now identified as part of the listeria monocytogenes outbreak the death occurred in the middle of july
7043724 how many people who are either confirmed or suspect cases have died
7043725 the number of deaths linked with this outbreak is higher than four
7043726 we are saying its probably because of contributing factors like the time frame and the fact the person resided in a retirement home
7043727 we are going through each case to determine that listeriosis was the cause of death and that the genetic footprint matches the same strain of listeriosis
7043728 as soon as we are getting that information we are releasing it there is no delay
7043729 by the same strain we mean that through genetic fingerprinting weve been able to link these strains together to show that there is commonality between them
7043730 of all the cases and the potential cases that weve got to date we so far havent been able to link to the national outbreak
7043731 we anticipate important new information over the weekend which will determine whether the product samples are aligned with those obtained from the people who became ill
7043732 authorities have been working around the clock cleared the shelves of products gone storefront by storefront
7043733 one of the tragic elements of all of this is that its so easy to prevent its a matter of simple cleanliness

7043743 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
7043744 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
7043745 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
7043746 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
7043747 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
7043748 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
7043749 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
7043750 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
7043751 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
7043752 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
7043753 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
7043754 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
7043755 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
7043756 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
7043757 cosa sto dicendo oramai ci sono e non torno indietro
7043758 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
7043759 no i will not be vice president under any circumstances
7043760 live well at home while making the world a better place
7043761 el pasado y presente de una persona en s lo una fotograf a
7043762 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7043763 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7043764 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7043765 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7043766 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7043767 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7043768 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7043769 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7043770 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7043771 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7043772 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7043773 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7043774 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7043775 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7043776 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7043777 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7043778 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7043779 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

7043783 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7043784 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7043785 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7043786 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7043787 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7043788 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7043789 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7043790 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7043791 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7043792 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7043793 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7043794 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7043795 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7043796 who are open to doing something on the production side
7043797 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7043798 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7043799 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7043800 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7043801 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7043802 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7043803 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7043804 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7043805 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7043806 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7043807 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7043808 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7043809 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7043810 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7043811 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7043812 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7043813 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7043814 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7043815 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7043816 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7043817 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7043818 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7043819 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7043820 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7043821 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7043822 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7043823 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7043824 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7043825 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7043826 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7043827 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7043828 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7043829 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7043830 la reconciliaci n interna en el seno de la iglesia
7043831 tiene al centro el sant simo sacramento que brilla de viva luz
7043832 a juan xxiii como forma extraordinaria del rito romano ha dado lugar a numerosos comentarios incluso el papa ha considerado conveniente salir al paso de algunas posibles interpretaciones err neas con una carta explicativa
7043833 el autor toma lugar en medio del grupo los disc pulos en la monta a de galilea escucha a jes s y habla con jes s mismo es tocado por la grandeza y por la pureza de sus palabras y sin embargo lo intranquiliza la inconciliabilidad final que encuentra en el n cleo del discurso de la monta a acompa a despu s a jes s en su camino hacia jerusal n y siempre vuelve a hablar con l pero al final decide no seguir a jes s permanece fiel a lo que l llama el israel eterno
7043834 deja trasparentar toda la dureza de las diferencias pero ocurre en un clima de gran amor el rabino acepta la alteridad del mensaje de jes s y se despide con una separaci n que no conoce odio y a n en el rigor de la verdad tiene siempre presente la fuerza conciliadora del amor
7043835 en los estados unidos desde hace dos siglos el di logo jud o cristiano ha servido como un medio para pol ticas de conciliaci n social no ha sido una investigaci n religiosa sobre las convicciones del otro con el libro jes s de nazaret las disputas jud o cristianas entran en una nueva era estamos en grado de encontrarnos los unos a los otros en un promisorio ejercicio de raz n y de critica

7043847 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7043848 we were disappointed that we werent able to meet his initial demand due to league rules as we would have definitely offered him an extension when he was signed to the offer sheet we had to explore every option but in the end decided that alex was too important to our plans for this season and beyond were very glad to have him locked up for a long time
7043849 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7043850 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7043851 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7043852 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7043853 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7043854 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7043855 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7043856 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7043857 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7043858 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7043859 when i gave them the keys to stay up there alone
7043860 una actitud coherente entre las disposiciones interiores y los gestos y las palabras
7043861 la relaci n entre el misterio cre do y celebrado se manifiesta de modo peculiar en el valor teol gico y lit rgico de la belleza en efecto la liturgia como tambi n la revelaci n cristiana est vinculada intr nsecamente con la belleza es veritatis splendor en la liturgia resplandece el misterio pascual mediante el cual cristo mismo nos atrae hacia s y nos llama a la comuni n
7043862 la verdadera belleza de la liturgia es el amor de dios que se ha revelado definitivamente en el misterio pascual
7043863 conscientes de todo esto hemos de poner gran atenci n para que la acci n lit rgica resplandezca seg n su propia naturaleza
7043864 un signo convincente de la eficacia que la catequesis eucar stica tiene en los fieles es sin duda el crecimiento en ellos del sentido del misterio de dios presente entre nosotros eso se puede comprobar a trav s de manifestaciones espec ficas de veneraci n de la eucarist a hacia la cual el itinerario mistag gico debe introducir a los fieles pienso en general en la importancia de los gestos y de la postura como arrodillarse durante los momentos principales de la plegaria eucar stica
7043865 los fieles estar n de rodillas durante la consagraci n a no ser que lo impida la enfermedad o la estrechez del lugar o la aglomeraci n de los participantes o cualquier otra causa razonable y los que no pueden arrodillarse en la consagraci n har n una profunda inclinaci n mientras el sacerdote hace la genuflexi n despu s de ella
7043866 el sacerdote toma despu s la patena o la p xide y se acerca a los que van a comulgar quienes de ordinario se acercan procesionalmente a los fieles no les es l cito tomar por s mismos ni el pan consagrado ni el sagrado c liz y menos a n pas rselos entre ellos de mano en mano los fieles comulgan de rodillas o de pie seg n lo haya establecido la conferencia de los obispos cuando comulgan de pie se recomienda que antes de recibir el sacramento hagan la debida reverencia del modo que determinen las citadas normas
7043867 es necesario que el lugar en que se conservan las especies eucar sticas sea identificado f cilmente por cualquiera que entre en la iglesia gracias tambi n a la lamparilla encendida para ello se ha de tener en cuenta la estructura arquitect nica del edificio sacro en las iglesias donde no hay capilla del sant simo sacramento y el sagrario est en el altar mayor conviene seguir usando dicha estructura para la conservaci n y adoraci n de la eucarist a evitando poner delante la sede del celebrante
7043868 el puesto m s habitual de la sede ser de cara al pueblo al fondo del presbiterio a no ser que la estructura del edificio o alguna otra circunstancia lo impida por ejemplo si a causa de la excesiva distancia resulta dif cil la comunicaci n entre el sacerdote y la asamblea congregada o si el sagrario ocupa un lugar central detr s del altar
7043869 pido a todos en particular a los ministros ordenados y a los que debidamente preparados est n autorizados para el ministerio de distribuir la eucarist a en caso de necesidad real que hagan lo posible para que el gesto en su sencillez corresponda a su valor de encuentro personal con el se or jes s en el sacramento
7043870 si est n presentes otros presb teros pueden ayudar al sacerdote a distribuir la comuni n si no est n disponibles y el n mero de comulgantes es muy elevado el sacerdote puede llamar para que le ayuden a los ministros extraordinarios es decir a un ac lito instituido o tambi n a otros fieles que para ello hayan sido designados 11 en caso de necesidad el sacerdote puede designar para esa ocasi n a fieles id neos estos ministros no acceden al altar antes de que el sacerdote haya comulgado y siempre han de recibir de manos del sacerdote el vaso que contiene la sant sima eucarist a para administrarla a los fieles
7043871 una actitud coherente entre las disposiciones interiores y los gestos y las palabras
7043872 es necesario que cada uno se examine a s mismo en profundidad cf 1 cor 11 28 para que quien sea consciente de estar en pecado grave no celebre la misa ni comulgue el cuerpo del se or sin acudir antes a la confesi n sacramental a no ser que concurra un motivo grave y no haya oportunidad de confesarse en este caso recuerde que est obligado a hacer un acto de contrici n perfecta que incluye el prop sito de confesarse cuanto antes
7043873 como se constata en la actualidad los fieles se encuentran inmersos en una cultura que tiende a borrar el sentido del pecado favoreciendo una actitud superficial que lleva a olvidar la necesidad de estar en gracia de dios para acercarse dignamente a la comuni n sacramental en realidad perder la conciencia de pecado comporta siempre tambi n una cierta superficialidad en la forma de comprender el amor mismo de dios ayuda mucho a los fieles recordar aquellos elementos que dentro del rito de la santa misa expresan la conciencia del propio pecado y al mismo tiempo la misericordia de dios
7043874 se crea realmente se celebre con devoci n y se viva intensamente este santo misterio
7043875 es toda la comunidad el cuerpo de cristo unido a su cabeza quien celebra
7043876 es necesario que en todo lo que concierne a la eucarist a haya gusto por la belleza se debe tambi n respetar y cuidar los ornamentos la decoraci n los vasos sagrados para que dispuestos de modo org nico y ordenado entre s fomenten el asombro ante el misterio de dios manifiesten la unidad de la fe y refuercen la devoci n
7043877 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7043878 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7043879 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7043880 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7043906 dos d as antes del show en obras arreglamos personalmente con el manager qu medidas de bengalas pod amos llevar
7043907 nosotros no quer amos ir a obras porque no nos gustaban un par de cosas la organizaci n del lugar es distinta a la nuestra nosotros queremos que la gente se divierta y no echamos a trompadas a un pibe porque prende una bengala como hacen ah los shows los damos para los chicos no para nosotros as que vamos a buscarle la vuelta para que se puedan divertir
7043908 todo lo que pasa en un show me encanta inclusive el tema de las bengalas que me mata porque en cierto punto no puedo respirar y menos cantar nuestra gente lleva todo tipo de pirotecnia

7043911 el hecho de que en un local cerrado un grupo de descerebrados encienda bengalas habla a las claras de una crisis de valores que est m s all de la supervisi n de un funcionario p blico
7043912 las bengalas son ingresadas por lo general por los invitados especiales dado que en los lugares vip no se hace el cacheo en rep blica croma n las bengalas llegaron del primer piso muchas veces los invitados las ingresan a pedido de los m s fan ticos de los grupos de rock y despu s se las entregan a los chicos

7043915 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7043916 i have not selected him as i do not think that he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7043917 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well
7043918 the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game
7043919 i shall talk to the player tomorrow he is our player and we shall work with him at training
7043920 while dimitar berbatov is still here he is very much a tottenham player
7043921 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
7043922 if a player is on form and he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
7043923 the vast majority of chinese people accepted that this was a very important chance to improve national solidarity and to show chinas progress to the world these goals have been reinforced and the chinese government has been quite successful at it
7043924 i have conducted operas in the west and it was so troublesome
7043925 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights we do not have that we can work very hard we can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month other than north korea no other country in the world can achieve this
7043926 this kind of uniformity brings beauty we chinese can do it too
7043927 our program had the highest level of political review since the founding of the peoples republic of china basically all reviews were from the central committee
7043928 we dont see any sign by the chinese leadership that it wants to establish genuine political reform its obvious that the party has no intention of accepting any diminution of its monopoly on power

7043947 when you talk about a sun devil you talk about rudy
7043948 what im most proud of is ive had some injuries but ive never missed a game
7043949 i cant lie to you i hear the fans that are critical of me and talk about bringing in somebody else
7043950 but i think to myself man i have a chance to be the all time guy at asu in all these categories and people still want me on the bench
7043951 canada continues to be a major producer for both domestic and international markets exporting significant quantities primarily to the u s and to a lesser extent japan australia and new zealand
7043952 we were 60th or something like that in the nation in total offense
7043953 we can certainly play a lot better than we did
7043954 there were times i thought we were pretty good and there were times when we were really inconsistent we have to play more consistent and deal with adversity better
7043955 this the first year weve had sophomores that we recruited he said
7043956 were a lot more mature team and a lot bigger we had to get extra pads for our skill guys because they couldnt fit in them
7043957 we had to make changes on defense and we did laslett said
7043958 we can do some different things with our running backs and they can catch the football
7043959 were a lot better up front but theres still a lot of work to be done right now as far as bringing everyone together
7043960 it seems like eight starters are hard to replace but i feel we underachieved as a defense last year
7043961 when we play with high energy and fly around and play hard were going to be successful
7043962 it does not mean we are going to smother everybody but were going to make them earn every yard
7043963 the younger guys are eager and nobody has been here they cant really talk the talk or walk the walk
7043964 he kept telling us the n stood for not today
7043965 every time we saw that helmet he wanted us to think not today not today you look back at that now and it sounds so corny but that has stuck with me forever and it was very motivating back then
7043966 that game felt different than any game i played in at arizona
7043967 it kind of felt like what i thought the super bowl would feel like it was like the lights were brighter it was different
7043968 it was definitely fun to play in it was probably the most fun i had in a football game
7043969 to this day anywhere i go walking around here in california they bring that game up
7043970 they can tell me more about the game than i can
7043971 the first thing i think about in that game is brad brennans catch
7043972 there was a lot of pressure at that point of the game
7043973 we kind of looked at each other and he broke off his route into a skinny post i knew i had to zip it in there and i threw it as hard as i could
7043974 he split two defenders and was excited to come out of that thing alive
7043975 nebraska was always a team you wanted to play wanted to beat
7043976 it would have been nice to build on that momentum and do better things after that
7043977 if you had told me after the holiday bowl that i wouldnt have gone to another bowl ever again i would have told you you were crazy
7043978 and if you had told me arizona wouldnt go to a bowl in the next nine seasons i would have said jump off a bridge because thats the dumbest thing
7043979 every game is a championship game for us so here we go there is great anticipation and i look forward to doing something special
7043980 carpenter spends a lot of time in my office studying the game he loves the game that is what separates himself from a lot of other quarterbacks
7043981 youve got to have support people because the quarterback cant do it on his own
7043982 our receiving corps is different we used to have a lot of smaller speed guys now we have bigger speedy guys
7043983 this system works and the schemes work we have the players to get it done
7043984 every year somebody comes out of the woodwork to make a name for themselves and take them to a place where nobody thought they could go hopefully that is in westwood this year
7043985 im just one guy if the attention is on me and we are still able to score with other people making plays and we are winning that is great i love it
7043986 when i came in we were the weakness of the team and now we are finally the strength a lot of guys had to develop and get better
7043987 the offense tries to find the best way to get people the ball and it allows players to move easily i like learning it as more and more time goes on
7043988 it is ultimately about wins and losses and i certainly understand that
7043989 the fans are passionate for what we do that is fine that is good
7043990 i am very passionate they get very upset when we lose games that we should have won believe me i understand that i am more upset than they are it hurts
7043991 there are things i have to take a step back and take a look at things that we have done well
7043992 you get beat down with all the negatives with all we havent done
7043993 we are a much stabler program than we have been in a long time and getting to a bowl game and having winning seasons is obviously the next part of the progression
7043994 its definitely not going to be an easy task to win the pac 10
7043995 last year we did a good job of winning the games we were supposed to win and we didnt do a good job of winning the games maybe we felt we could have won
7043996 this year we have to take that next step if we want to be talking about the bcs
7043997 i thought i was a little small playing at 205 and i felt i got wore down a little bit toward the end of the year
7043998 i felt if i put on some weight some muscle i could maybe last a little bit longer be stronger toward the end of the season
7043999 part of me loves it because its going to be a great opportunity for us as a university and for us as a football team to show what we can do against some of the best teams in the country
7044000 then again its pretty rough that can be a pretty difficult stretch if we dont take care of business we could be hurting at that time of the year
7044001 its the bar everybody in our league has to get over thats just how it is
7044002 bullet injured aziz was brought to the hospital with protruding intestines on aug 11
7044003 he aziz was brought dead we couldnt conduct any post mortem because the body was soon taken by an angry mob for funeral
7044004 pierced through azizs body and even forensic experts cannot say what kind of bullet hit him
7044005 the bullet had entered the left side of his back and left from the right side
7044006 we have just lodged firs first information reports and detailed investigations would be launched soon
7044007 pakistan backed separatists have been using the tool of political killing to stoke anti india passions in the valley but i am not sure if azizs death falls in that category
7044008 nobody is going to believe this narayanans theory he was killed in police and paramilitary firing and i am an eyewitness to that
7044009 aziz fell to the forces bullets in front of senior administrative and police officials
7044010 district commissioner baseer khan and district police chief b sreenivas were there and even they know who killed aziz

7044034 weve been tested a lot ive been tested four times even before i started running
7044035 ive been tested so many times in the competition ive lost count we know were good we know were clean we work hard and any time you want to test us its ok
7044036 what almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good
7044037 we have been good for a very long time the quality of our coaching and the talent that we have is just showing up now and justifying our place as the leading athletics country in the world
7044038 i would not like anybody to suggest that this is anything but pure raw talent properly trained properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7044039 all the records that youve seen broken and all the gold medals that have been won by jamaica in the last two weeks have come after extensive testing of our athletes
7044040 there have been 32 tests conducted on jamaican athletes over the last three weeks here in beijing over 25 of our athletes have been tested representing 50 percent of our aggregation
7044041 so all the medals won by usain bolt and his team mates have come after extensive testing by
7044042 im sure they could have played better its going to be a tough game theyre not in the championship game for no reason this team won the world championship in 06 and now theyre back to the championship
7044043 i believe once they knew the game was over they let it down
7044044 theres no holding back on sunday on for either team theres no excuse
7044045 i think theyll be even more dangerous with calderon out because it gives the young kid rubio more playing time and he likes the spotlight
7044046 pau gasol and those guys get another chance at us theyre a dangerous team
7044047 that wasnt a process this has been a process not just to win a gold medal but to win something that will go forward in 1992 they were thinking it was the first time the nba was here and it was a celebration of a great team this is much different

7044121 sorry for the interruption sir the colonel has called an early briefing before the honchos leave state security is the topic you and top dog have been requested
7044122 ya got 10 minutes jump into the shower and heres a fresh uniform
7044123 yeah the names are not regulation but i guarantee no one will gripe these were made weeks ago now hurry you dont want to be late sergeant
7044124 if you promise not to fight you can go sit with her
7044125 full house for you new people no notes eye and ears only mention the any of the contents at your peril accidents happen to loose lips ok why are we here g2 you called it
7044126 g2 has signal intelligence that despite our successes of the past few days indicates that an organized oppfor exists it is our opinion that this explains the slave market of previous briefings we will be debriefing the refugees who have just arrived for further details we would expect to put an clandestine interdiction scouting force out of state to gather evidence if as we expect we can identify targets we will seek the general staffs endorsement of a carte blanche request to the governor we sought this forum to alert the forces in the field that they should not relax their vigilance thinking the threats are past history i request that you instruct the militia forces accordingly
7044127 youre a busy fellow colonel but better safe than sorry governor with your permission the general staff orders all forces to be on the alert for any hostile action against the citizens of vermont patrols outside of the state are authorized as the local command authority deems necessary general armody that does not mean you can recon new york city in force no matter how many cigars you think youll find
7044128 lets be clear here folks youre protecting your mother and vermont you have to explain you actions to her and to the people and she as well as they have to be proud of you no rule book will condemn you or reward you do whats need to get the job done if in doubt consult your command authority if in doubt and you are the command authority consult you conscience and your top sergeant thats why the tops are here in this briefing if they are confused they can consult with me id like to see that miracle a confused top like jumbo shrimp
7044129 governor and chief i believe you want to see me and these people
7044130 and when you get to montpelier we have to spend some time talking about your future
7044131 well dogs meet your new boss boss meet your new dogs
7044132 well do just fine marie is possessed of the finest math mind i know this side of the atlantic and from what ive seen john has the biggest set of brass ones outside of pawn shop if they can steer a mob while creating a cohesive fighting unit crossing several hundred miles of hostile countryside than this will be a short putt id suggest that you two make all your family arrangements over the next few days youll be very busy after that colonel you have a week to show me the ropes
7044133 ropes you helped me set these ropes up show you the ropes you were probably one of the folks that got me kicked upstairs lifer
7044134 no your chief cheerleader was armody blame him he threw you under the bus to save himself from having to take the job too bad about the old coot i figured that it had to be something like that to dislodge him he bled vermont
7044135 it was seven hundred and fifty miles and if im so good how come two of my friends got killed
7044136 im sorry about your friends but you have to know that mistakes get people killed even when you do everything perfect people are going to up and die on you just focus on the mission we are keeping the people of vermont safe from criminals sneaking up on them your arrival will soon make everyone a little safer as all our children are taught your magic sticks its a perfect weapon for kids to defend with thats a high priority activity for you you have to now grow up i know you have a set use em the people of vermont need your best effort even if they never know who you are
7044137 i was hoping to raise my foster children and my own children in peace math was always academic to me do i have to do this
7044138 my dear sweet marie all along the frontiers we have children defending homesteads in the regiment youve just met they have a boy fourteen leading scouts and a man 80 whos the regimental pt instructor hard times are on us everyone has to do their duty as they see it i no one is going to tell you what you have to do you have gifts that are unique and irreplaceable if you wont or cant use them to help then thats a shame well have to figure it out given what youve done i think ive said youll see your duty and do it just as everyone else is doing besides im not a terrible boss you can have a family a life and do your duty we need done youre a smart girl youll figure it out now go have breakfast and help your people adjust colonel ears and i have serious work to do
7044139 yes shameless i know desperate times desperate measures learned it from you when i just wanted to be a math prof
7044140 yeah you dont spend decades around these folks without learning to read the tea leaves
7044141 well these two have been volunteered for some heavy intelligence work they really are youngsters but based on what they have accomplished getting here they are need to apply those skills to some new problems marie was in what ill call happily ever after mode silly rabbit and john was planning to go back to some sort of life like before the bomb another silly rabbit
7044142 its a dangerous world out there and we dont have the luxury of wasting any asset life is changing every day vermont has to change with it i see all sorts of changes coming children will no longer waste the first 25 years of their lives adults will no longer be tossed on the rubbish pile for the last 50 years of their life vermont is going to become the economic miracle of the northeast it has natural advantages that will make it possible think the switzerland of the new world and these kids have to buy everyone time to make it happen
7044143 well children i cant tell you what to do but i can tell you that you have your home on the farm and louie and i will help you in whatever way we can after all thats what family is all about
7044144 my family is dead you told us but we didnt believe it
7044145 you have a lot of folks depending upon you to be strong including me
7044146 marie dear thats not being silly its being human can i tell you about some of the challenges ahead and some of the things the old wives club has done to ease you way into the new world
7044147 when we got wind that you were coming we knew wed have to help you all find good situations to fit into we have put the word out statewide for host families businesses with jobs and just anyone with an idea the response was deafening we have opportunities for groups up to size 30 we have ones i suggest that your family strategy was good we have in the breakfast area everything boarded there are opportunities described with age size or education qualifications to make it easy on everyone i think you should urge everyone to study all the options then regroup to discuss them in the family structure if an individual wants to do something then it would be best to permit them if the family wants to do something as a group then they can do that if we work at it i think everyone will find what they like
7044148 john you and marie and all of your group is welcome at the farm youll see why today this afternoon we planned to have the funeral this afternoon and the wedding tomorrow
7044149 but we were going to have that small wedding to make an honest woman out of marie
7044150 i dont need to be made honest i didnt do anything
7044151 dear it doesnt matter to anyone what you did or didnt do the tongues will wag the good folks wouldnt care if you did the bad ones wouldnt believe you anyway we have all the funeral arrangements made the wedding arrangements are being made as we speak you have a task force of a little more than half the wives of the regiment working on landings and a less than half the rest on funeral wedding feeding housekeeping its a done deal
7044152 no what we have done is map out all the choices you have to make and you have to convince everyone that this is a good idea my biggest fear is shock knocking people into a a frozen lethargy youre the leader lead
7044153 we have to look our best if were going to attract a man
7044154 marie whats wrong we didnt mean to make you cry
7044155 nothing gal pals of mine its just we have so many challenges no road map and all these depending upon us coming to vermont seems to have been the easy part

7044264 how do you get activity going if the moon is owned by everyone at the same time

7044540 it is extremely rare for two incidents of this nature to occur just over a mile apart in an area such as workington and we are devoting significant resources to catching those responsible

7044547 under the circumstances it is difficult to avoid the impression that the cia and other intelligence agencies defended themselves against the dangers of attack from the bush administration through a process of self censorship
7044548 the net impression is that the cia white paper was rewritten to conform to administration preferences if so u s intelligence a priori made itself a tool of a political effort vitiating the intelligence function and confirming the presence of a politicized process
7044549 the specific analytic failures on iraq intelligence become much less significant in such a climate especially in that they all yielded intelligence predictions of exactly the kind the bush administration wanted to hear
7044550 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant

7044555 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president
7044556 senator biden has never run anything but his mouth such a desperate attack from senator biden is to be expected considering i katie levinson have a better chance of becoming president than he does
7044557 its what you have to do in order to have a chance against the usa
7044558 if you try to go showtime against them that wont work because thats what they want to do and they do it better

7044605 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7044606 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7044607 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7044608 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7044609 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7044610 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7044611 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7044612 the document signed by your majesty is offensive to the nation and to the abiding spirit of autocracy

7044615 roller coasters are great but our children are the future of coney island
7044616 i testified at a public scoping hearing on june 24th and wasnt too popular with some of the amusement activists who were in attendance about my concern that a lot people who consider themselves advocates for coney island are missing the larger point the rides the sideshows the unique attractions that make coney island such a wonderful place to visit make are only part of a much bigger picture look beyond the roller coaster and youll find families struggling to get by and students who have a hard time finding after school jobs in their community having rides and a beautiful beach are all great things but what do these things do for the kids growing up in coney island

7044645 dice que si dos de los tres partidos hacen alianza entonces el fap ir a hacer campa a por esos dos dejando al margen al prd
7044646 la actitud que tienen alejandro encinas dante delgado alberto anaya y mu oz ledo es de ir a romper el partido en el estado de m xico
7044647 esto les pasa a los que pasan informaci n a los militares atentamente ffmm
7044648 estoy contento de la actuaci n ten a el objetivo de acabar era una competencia bastante dura y termin satisfecho

7044650 wenn man hier beim ersten rennen auf einem neuen stra enkurs von der pole startet ist das eine tolle ausgangslage
7044651 meine runde war gut und wir haben ein gutes auto f r das rennen
7044652 da war ich fantastisch unterwegs und habe die grundlage gelegt
7044653 felipe hat im ersten sektor alle in grund und boden gefahren da sind wir morgen hoffentlich besser
7044654 ich war ein oder zwei zehntel hinter ihm dort habe ich die zeit liegen gelassen es war also keine super runde von mir aber sie war okay
7044655 es war ein gutes qualifying f r mich und das team
7044656 wir hatten in den letzten rennen pech aber hier ist unsere pace besser dennoch gibt es eine l cke zu mclaren und ferrari
7044657 wir gehen mit der denkweise nach dortmund dass wir danach vier punkte auf dem konto haben
7044658 letztlich hat die partie nichts mehr mit dem supercup spiel zu tun aber wir wollen es den bayern erneut so schwer wie m glich machen
7044659 nat rlich hat er lange nicht gespielt daf r hat er aber im training gute grundlagen gelegt
7044660 wir sind gut drauf so dass es ein interessantes duell wird
7044661 da in dieser angelegenheit bis heute keine gesetzlichen regelungen vorhanden sind betrachten wir das ganze als rechtliche grauzone
7044662 americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken washington arent going to find them on the obama biden ticket
7044663 john mccains comprehensive energy reform plan is supported by a broad and bipartisan majority of americans who are tired of struggling with high gas prices and soaring utility bills and hes taken the bold step of calling on speaker pelosi to bring congress back from its break to vote on house republicans american energy act mccain is a real reformer and the only candidate in this race who is ready to lead
7044664 viele von uns erhielten vor dem absturz von unseren verwandten sms aus dem flugzeug dass mit der maschine etwas nicht stimmte
7044665 wir wollen hier keine politiker mehr sehen wir wollen endlich wissen was wirklich passiert ist
7044666 right now weve sent reconnaissance teams to ten different counties and have additional forces standing by in north florida
7044667 there are another 14 or so counties that may need assistance as this storm passes westward across the state we are well prepared to assist in any high water vehicle missions especially search and rescue and area assistance survey work we work well with our local county and municipal partners and are ready to help them in any way we can
7044668 were maintaining the whole warehouse and just pretty much waiting for the storm
7044669 we have all the trucks stocked and are making sure everything is ready to go
7044670 the rern system gives the state the ability to rapidly deploy a communications network anywhere if the comms have been lost
7044671 and this gives the commanders on the ground the ability to run their operations and get assets out to the people who need them quickly
7044672 this is a very odd storm in the sense that it is moving so slowly and it has zig zagged across the state
7044673 this is a storm that has the unique potential to make landfall five times thats not happened before
7044674 i had even read some articles about the other competitors before i began i knew the competition was going to be tough i knew i was going to give it my best effort but quite honestly i expected not to win
7044675 i never thought six months ago before i started all of this that this would ever happen in my career so its a bit overwhelming now of course the challenge is going to be the next level but thats kind of the way its been up to this point
7044676 when you get done with this competition you can stand up to anybody at any time and youll have that confidence level because youll know you have done something that very few people can say they have done or ever will do
7044677 we had the regional competition a few months ago and i got into really good shape for that
7044678 so all you have to do is maintain it its basically all the same events
7044679 there have been a lot of other events here so far that ive never done before like the combat swim
7044680 that was the best just getting pushed off that high dive without knowing when youre going to hit the water i wouldnt even mind doing it a little higher next time just to get that adrenaline pumping
7044681 the toughest part and i didnt anticipate this was the ruck march
7044682 i just anticipated stepping out jogging in a few parts and pretty much just shutting off my mind and just ruck but it actually took a lot of mental fortitude to get through that and that was more challenging than i expected it to be most other ruck marches im fine
7044683 the most challenging thing for me was that im a full time student and i usually take 18 21 credit hours per semester
7044684 so to balance that and still try and stay on top of this has been a bit of a headache sometimes but its working out so far
7044685 all around when they say i am a warrior and a member of a team from the soldiers creed whoever wrote that wasnt kidding this really was a team effort
7044686 i spent a lot of time doing ruck marches and runs typically with my dog
7044687 hes a pit bull but he requires a lot of exercise so that was one way to get out and move a lot
7044688 the biggest thing is to just soak up every minute of it you can learn so much from not only the cadre but from the senior enlisted people you meet throughout it
7044689 meta materials are artificial materials with versatile properties that can be tailored to fit almost any practical need
7044690 similar to general relativity where time and space are curved transformation optics shows that the space for light can also be bent in an almost arbitrary way
7044691 if youre out on the battlefield and you see a cloud coming or you suspect there might be an aerosol chemical or biological warfare being used against you its very difficult to quickly detect what the material is
7044692 so this would be an enormous an enormous improvement and not just on the battlefield but it would allow us to make all kinds of materials what we call nanomanufacturing
7044693 which could go into electronic and optical devices that youd use from night vision goggles to distance sensors to other kinds of sensors
7044694 one of the most exciting applications is an electromagnetic cloak that can bend light around itself similar to the flow of water around a stone
7044695 making invisible both the cloak and an object hidden inside
7044696 this experiment was performed in 2006 and it was almost like a chain reaction
7044697 the field of transformation optics and meta materials and negative index materials exploded with this but as i say the proof of principle has a long way to go before we can see that on the battlefield
7044698 you have to give him a reason to do it
7044699 most of what aquinas has written hasnt been translated yet
7044700 that 5 000 people in the united states die every year from foodborne illnesses is tragic
7044701 food producers need to address the source of the problem too fast processing lines and dirty conditions at plants not promote an expensive impractical and ineffective technology like irradiation
7044702 ghanaian are loud and boisterous they enjoyed a heated debate
7044703 ron fournier given that he almost went to work for mccain last year and that he sends gushing emails to karl rove isnt this kind of troubling
7044704 rights to control hoarding in the state lies with state government and it should take steps against such hoardings
7044705 what is needed is restoration of the dialogue process to bring the state back to normalcy

7044709 we were the unlikeliest lot and that is precisely why god has chosen us
7044710 it just kind of cracks you open in a lot of ways
7044711 i dont know that i would have made this particular record if that hadnt have happened
7044712 it is more of a self reflective divorce record it is not about ben
7044713 i guess there are always going to be things in it that people are going to construe to be about him
7044714 if you make it from your heart it is impossible to avoid
7044715 i dont think it is a blaming record it is more about my own reflection
7044716 i dont think i have ever laughed or cried so much in my life
7044717 it was sort of like therapy going in there as a woman when you are juggling motherhood and being married to somebody who has a pretty huge career and living in two continents and travelling a lot it is hard to fill your own shoes
7044718 it is hard to find your own voice and that is something that i wasnt very good at doing you can lose yourself and what you need to say and do in those times
7044719 so i was kind of finding my voice coming out of that
7044720 theyre giving me the opportunity so im going to take it
7044721 it was definitely part of the decision growing up with those guys and playing baseball with them
7044722 everyone you play is good and youve got to bring your a game every time you play
7044723 theyre going to give me the opportunity to pitch whether its over the weekend middle of the week or out of the bullpen ill do whatever i can do to help a amp m win

7044761 republican violence since 1968 has ensured that a lasting and stable settlement of the relationship between north and south has remained elusive even as the british government has signaled a willingness to divest itself of its commitments in northern ireland should a majority of that community so desire
7044762 similarly the essentially conservative home rule movement which sought to provide security for irish protestants and guarantees for british strategic interests ultimately failed in the face of unionist and republican intransigence
7044763 asa cum am promis si la lansarea noului sistem de etichetare cze venim cu un program amplu de informare si de mobilizare a cetatenilor indiferent cat de eficient ar fi sistemul de etichetare fara o campanie de informare care sa le explice cetatenilor cum sa foloseasca noile etichete acesta nu poate avea impactul dorit in aceasta etapa insa nu am venit cu informatii noi ci incercam sa facem o campanie pentru a stimula mobilitatea in randul cetatenilor trebuie sa constientizam ca o dieta echilibrata nu poate fi conceputa fara miscare fizica mai mult nu putem sa neglijam aspectele ecologice ale mijloacelor de mobilitate urbana fara motorizare

7044765 sunt initiatoarea campaniei sport pentru viata tocmai pentru a veni in intampinarea copiiilor si pentru a le spune cat de minunat este sportul si cat de frumos poti sa te dezvolti prin sport avem nevoie in romania de o cultura a miscarii si de aceea eu sustin initiativele care incearca sa ne invete cum sa traim sanatos
7044766 am practicat sportul inca din copilarie mi e greu sa stau cateva zile fara miscare si stiu cat de importanta este aceasta pentru sanatate de aceea incerc sa nu treaca o zi fara sport suntem alaturi de fiecare initiativa care promoveaza un stil de viata sanatos

7044813 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7044814 we will be negotiating with them about the number and location of checkpoints in the future
7044815 not envisaged by any agreement including the one which was mediated by the french president nicolas sarkozy
7044816 agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7044817 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7044818 without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations

7044821 im gutted i really thought i could do it today and i just missed out
7044822 i just misjudged my finish a little bit so its disheartening i was desperate to get a medal i wanted it and feel like ive missed a really good opportunity there
7044823 i just missed it by a split second i think its such a fine line in the past ive gone a little bit too hard too early and finished further down so its hard
7044824 there was some more there thats the frustrating thing there was more to give and i messed up tactically
7044825 i would rather have gone 20 seconds slower and have a medal
7044826 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7044827 i have not selected him as i do not think he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7044828 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game i shall talk to the player tomorrow he is our player and we shall work with him at training

7045162 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
7045163 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
7045164 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
7045165 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
7045166 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
7045167 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties

7045188 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7045189 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7045190 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7045191 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7045192 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7045193 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7045228 the imaginary time bomb why an ageing population is not a social problem
7045229 historically modern societies double their wealth about every twenty five years this kind of growth projected across the next half century would dwarf the extra pension and other costs to society of more elderly dependents moreover it is far from certain that extra years of life mean extra years of ill health and dependency serious disease tends to be concentrated towards the end of life so living longer may simply postpone the point of onset without increasing the costs

7045240 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs

7045351 my group has come across some alarming evidence of a mutant conspiracy
7045352 yes not conquest like magneto or experimentation like mr sinister but more along the lines of apocalypses conversion of humanity
7045353 who is hard to explain the first reports begin around the beginning of the twenty century so its either a long living mutant or a group of individual we believe its the former rather than the later because we have scene many cases describes a man known as the doctor as for how a new super soldier serum
7045354 project rebirth headed by professor abraham erskine managed to produce captain america however erskine was murdered moments after rogers was successfully empowered the refinements he introduced which made the process successful lost with his death
7045355 project rebirth began as collaboration between the american british and german eugenicists led by doctors reinstein and koch when world war ii began koch took over the german program and josef reinstein erskine moved to the american program the original programs purpose is the creation of super soldiers intended to fight the wars of the future especially a mutant human war the ultimate goal was the total extermination of mutant kind
7045356 yes if the war hadnt occurred super soldiers like steve rogers would be killing mutants like your misfits
7045357 the doctors new super serum not only enhances the user but also alters there genetics granting them a regenerative healing factor like weapon x x 23 and dark the problem is the doctor is releasing to select individuals and our attempts to secure samples have failed
7045358 we want your misfits to raid a serum production facility the details are in folder
7045359 the basis for the detection system is only people who have taken the serum can get within range without setting off the alarms
7045360 in other words only mutants can reach the island without setting off the main alarms and our ability to simulate mutant abilities is insufficient
7045361 what are the deterrents i know you people can afford to be loud
7045362 two reasons what samples we managed to obtain broke down into simple amino acids and radiogenic tracers meaning we need fresh untampered samples the other reason is the facility has a powerful self destruct system that is armed by a major security breech

7045364 capoeira a blend of martial art game and dance originated in brazil i learned it when a greenshirt made a comment about the moves resembling ginga
7045365 pronounced jinga and literally meaning rocking back and forth or to swing is the fundamental movement in capoeira
7045366 i noticed that as well the way toad moves do to his body structure would make him a natural at it add a good kicking style and he could mop the floor with most opponents
7045367 he also said in that 2006 film dead or alive featured a scene in which the ninjutsu practitioner hayabusa uses ground capoeira to fend off attackers
7045368 jj how did you know about ginga i thought you hated physical work
7045369 i left the x men to get away from there stupid danger room but the joes want me to learn how to fight
7045370 ive been looking for the best for me i learned some aikido and judo so far
7045371 shipwreck switched the bottles with booze since he thought the people on the ship would have there sea legs
7045372 now what have i told you about stealing mr stupid
7045373 sgt snuffles is different hes pickle head beachhead teddy bear and guilty by association
7045374 mr stupid is mine and i beginning to wonder if your a masochist if you are i might as well throw you overboard now
7045375 gamma the files are research on gamma and its effects on living creatures normal human cells are destroyed by high energy photons as they strip the electrons from organic molecules there are two exceptions
7045376 he can be nice if you approach him in a friendly manner
7045377 yeah trinity managed to make a boy scout out of him
7045378 its interesting to note that the young genius banner once created a bomb because of his imaginary friend the hulk a bomb which he later disarmed but caused the military to take interest in him and lead to the creation of the gamma bomb
7045379 his father smashes his wifes skull he smashes his fathers skull hulk smash the hulk is an alternate personality born from the abuse
7045380 they talk about gamma nutrient baths and other techniques to reverse the mutation
7045381 what about the second type you said gamma mutants were the first
7045382 i had jj and arcade hack the files when i overheard a conversation in hawks office
7045383 a couple of dark suited government agents were talking about gamma source in japan and a gamma radiation surge in space they said they have been worried about japanese mutants for a long time
7045384 samurai clans contained a lot of pure blood but modern yukuza and ninja clans contain the outcasts
7045385 those hibakusha including the former korean prisoners could cause a mass increase in mutant activity
7045386 the reason there have been more cases reported in the western world is likely due to the early radiation experiments in the states and france and people like mr sinister trying to speed things up
7045387 there is also the fact people used uranium in glass and ceramic until the twenty century
7045388 my great great great granduncle jebdiah dukes made pots for the town of dirty scrape they werent very good pots but they keep the bath water warm which was very important since the town was deep in northern canada
7045389 they didnt learn that the pots were bad until the town pig died they would have known earlier from the skin problems and extra limbs if dirty scrap didnt have a rash of skin problems and there were too many husbands who were also brothers and uncles
7045390 we havent even left the boat yet and we are already messed up
7045391 i dont care whose in charge as long as i get to kill that traitor dark
7045392 keep yourself calm pike anger will only deteriorate your skills
7045393 gamma team is with me and delta team is with the second lot move out
7045394 this is place i was at before i lost most of my memory the secret mutant school
7045395 the enhanced armor possesses superior strength boosting abilities and greater protection it also has a new assortment of lethal weaponry the new models also dont have the same power sources meaning they can go on much longer missions and can think of strategy instead of rushing battle to finish before the power runs out
7045396 instead of anti mutant shock rifles the soldiers have phased plasma assault rifle that can punch holes in a fifty centimeter thick steel plate
7045397 instead of expensive flash bang grenades they have high yield shrapnel and incendiary grenades these grenades can be used to level entire areas and blast there living targets into extra chunky spaghetti
7045398 when i first lost my right arm i had a cybernetic one with superhuman strength built but i didnt fully understand it once i tried to lift a truck but because the rest of my body was organic i ended up smashing my face into the wood the second time i ripped my arm out of the joint and nearly bleed to death
7045399 i went for full body cybernetic conversion and had my limbs modified to separate and become semi independent of my body
7045400 so you young fools think you have one there are two reasons im called legacy
7045401 i was a scientist working on a cloning project when i died of the legacy virus i survived by transferring my mind into my younger clone a engineered clone or bioroid with superior physical abilities a minor healing factor and deliberate congenital insensitivity to pain i didnt want to feel pain ever again
7045402 i lost that first clone body when i needed to fake my death i managed to create many replacement bodies including ones with toxic blood for trapping powerful mutants
7045403 power disrupter that alone could kill you with poisoning from your own metal laced bone claws
7045404 oh shes your friend ill be sure she dies slowly
7045405 my codename is pike it was given to me by eden academy you and me were students i hated working with a lesser but your were a good student
7045406 my grandparents were of pure blood they were selected by the state in the late 1940s to give birth to new unpolluted race by the state the enemies of the fatherland destroyed berlin but several loyal nurses and one doctor managed to escape with my four grandparents and two others they trained there adopted children to be warriors while hidden in the forests of south america they gave birth to my parents and trained them and finally gave birth and trained me and my brother
7045407 no those fools thought me and brother were abominations pollution of there bloodlines
7045408 me and my brother were forced to kill them to prove our superiority
7045409 in the past there was homo sapiens aeternus the eternals a powerful race possessing eternal life and virtual invulnerability and thought as the ancient gods themselves
7045410 crazy i am dedicated and loyal words that mean nothing to you traitor the eden academy was created to train the superior warriors to destroy the lesser races i was the man who proved my loyalty by killing my own brother
7045411 when you betrayed us and left the commanders were forced to select the strongest and most loyal of the rest they had us fight one another to the death and only the strongest survived it was me prince and abyss that survived we will survive to see a new dawn
7045412 weapon ten the infamous weapon x that escaped and became the worse threat to the weapon program
7045413 what a joke if i didnt have orders to bring you to the director i could kill you in an instant
7045414 do any of you have a power inhibiter the one i was carrying was destroyed early in the fight
7045415 the censored is too hard to kill i need to shut off her powers to finish the job even a plastic bag would be enough to smother her
7045416 no sir i think the rest of the inhibiters are at the factory
7045417 we also cleaned up the garbage before the academy was abandoned
7045418 fine well take her with wolverine back to home base and kill her there
7045419 the orders are to eliminate all mutants excluding weapon x
7045420 that was to immobilize them so they would be easier to kill
7045421 the bad guys capture the heroes the bad guys taunt and reveal there plans the heroes break free or are rescued the plans are ruined and the bad guys are defeated or killed
7045422 dont delude yourself soldier as far the united states government is concerned especially g i joe the misfits are heroes which makes us the bad guys we even using a big n to destroy the evidence
7045423 rina isnt healing because that prince guy put something inside her body
7045424 why dont you use the sea water to cool it
7045425 trinity made him resistant to electricity but everything has limits
7045426 when when we get back to the pit the ninja and wolverine i need more training
7045427 i dont know how to help rina i dont have the tools or skills to remove it
7045428 the inhibitor is a energy field device pure electronic in nature an electrical surge threw rina could destroy the device
7045429 a couple of months ago trinity had that sensory manipulation chip the one cobra developed looking for a new mind control chip she made everything i ate taste like greens
7045430 i couldnt find it because it was so small and they had the radio transmitter codes so i used the tazer
7045431 the taser that altheas been using on her dad recently
7045432 enough of this we have to stop the inhibitor before rinas injuries or her own bones kill her
7045433 fire earth metal water wood fire wood to fire fire is protected from water fire blast ignite
7045434 youve got to ask yourself a question do i feel lucky well do ya punk
7045435 earth to metal metal is protected from fire metal splits the wind
7045436 holy crap he looks like an anbu like from my naruto manga
7045437 how how did you get our of your restraints so fast
7045438 while you were distracted by chases wind shield i used a few friends of mine this is another friend
7045439 microscopic machines that deconstruct molecular materials and nanomachines at a molecular level
7045440 only the doctor and his people possess that technology our own technology was reverse engineered from captured pieces of technology
7045441 what are you talking about this place was abandoned before the project could raid all we managed to do was capture the academy and its students
7045442 dammit you didnt know that you didnt know about the doctor
7045443 it doesnt matter one way or the other you all die today
7045444 karas is my codename masato is my real name just dont call me crow boy
7045445 the name is kusanagi those were yamatos phase disrupter shells
7045446 electromagnetic rounds designed to effect intangible people and objects the second he felt pain his body automatically shifted phase out of reflex he became solid inside a solid fusion
7045447 we soldiers are taught to fight beyond our limits till we die my time is done and i can remember who i was before before the weapon project came please
7045448 an interesting fact about magic is because it distorts probability and space time it causes electromagnetic disturbances that effect electrical and electronic mechanism unless shielded or modified to work in magical fields
7045449 hence legacy cant call more bodies or transmit his mind beyond these six
7045450 so what are we going to do with them him whatever
7045451 we cant let this guy escape hes too dangerous and he works for the weapon program
7045452 there tenth project was the one that gave wolverine his metal claws roman numeral for ten is x hence weapon x
7045453 a clandestine program dedicated to destroying all mutants wanda i need a big hex blast
7045454 lightning fire earth metal water wood water to wood wood is protected from metal wood crushes heaven and earth forest thunder snake
7045455 im more worried about what pretty boy prince and that idiot soldier said
7045456 the first clue was the fact you dont really bleed
7045457 the second was when i touched you my technopathy was able to mess you up
7045458 i didnt want to bring xi but he threatened to teleport to east hanover new jersey
7045459 originally known as national biscuit company is a brand of cookies and snacks including chips ahoy
7045460 listen up the islands field generators must have been inside the factory and were destroyed in the collapse communications and teleportation are online including satellite which just found something
7045461 a radioactive source most likely uranium or plutonium surrounded by high explosives
7045462 a sorceress a cyborg and an alien girl all you need is masked fighter and you have the teen titans ive scene japanese versions of american comics so i thought you were cosplay for a new teen titan manga
7045463 well none of us are teenagers but titans does sound good
7045464 my name is alex kusanagi the sorceress is yuna chase and the alien girl is valarie evans also called val the reason why your here is when we were crashing we were forced to eject our reactor but miscalculated where it would land instead of crashing into the deep pacific it crashed into the river you were next to
7045465 arariel is the name of a long forgotten angel that precedes over the waters of the earth
7045466 its also a star ship this ship can fly in space in the atmosphere hover over the ground and even dive low into the water it was built in machina shipyard alpha and until recently possessed a matter antimatter reactor we were able to remove the 100 kg of antimatter but we were forced to eject the core
7045467 we used the ships most powerful weapon the positron blaster cannon to shoot the antimatter into deep space
7045468 the reaction of 1 kg of antimatter with 1 kg of matter would produce 180 petajoules of energy by the mass energy equivalence formula e mc or the rough equivalent of 47 megatons of tnt
7045469 the problem is that while the reactor no longer contained antimatter it did contain a large amount of high energy photons when it crashed near you you were exposed to several times the lethal dose of gamma radiation
7045470 wha if thats true why am i skill alive and now dressed in a cosplay outfit
7045471 shouldnt i be covered in burns hair falling out and dying in hospital bed
7045472 nanomedicine we injected you with bionano organic nanotechnology that rebuilt your cells on a molecular level correcting the damage done by the gamms radiation
7045473 they contain a limited amount of energy and rapidly reproduce inside the host to make repairs when the energy is spent they dissolve into simple amino acids that are absorbed by the body or excreted the blue glow is actually the energy slowly being released
7045474 you are completely healed but there was a slight problem
7045475 we didnt have a complete record of your dna to program into the nanomachines and you were dying rapidly so he used the dna of another who could have been our crewman
7045476 our friend jason was from the same world as me and chase
7045477 he was going to join us for this trip but he needed to help friends in albion at the last minute something about helping queen ester and her husband stop a group of mad summoners we still had his nanomedicine in stock and used it to save your life it was designed to repair damage if exposed to high level gamma during the trip
7045478 healing factor so no lethal powers or weird looks if im a mutant at least i have the most practical power hell i bet there are people who wished they could heal lethal would never be sick or drugged and live for centuries at least thats what people online are theorizing
7045479 why would i im hikikomori a hermit i havent joined society in years
7045480 the japanese government and other groups in your homeland are looking for mutants there even sending people disguised as social workers and utility men with miniature mutant energy detectors they figure that people who hide from the world instead of acting like a stoic japanese countryman could have many things to hide
7045481 we can empty your apartment when we have the chance
7045482 but you need training to defend yourself in this world there are way too many dangers
7045483 it would take to long to learn the normal way so are you going to download martial arts into my brain like neo in the matrix
7045484 if you had the cybernetic interfaces and we had the correct programs we could download skills like in that series
7045485 but your healing factor would reject the implants even if we had them
7045486 ive never scene so many languages saying the same thing
7045487 hey how come i can understand what you guys are saying
7045488 i speak japanese and did poor on my english test
7045489 its a magical language known as magianese its a mixture of several languages connected to a spell that spreads like the flu all i have to do is talk to someone and there infected by the language the side effect is you also speak all the languages used to create the magianese
7045490 my world was once an parallel earth the world was unique in that it contained many supernatural threats like vampires demons and evil mages thinks changed during halloween of 97 when one chaos mage called upon the power of the roman god janus to empower to spell his evil little plan was to turn people into there costumes for a single night
7045491 you mean like what your about to do to me
7045492 dont interrupt his plan was a simple night of chaos but the spell went out of control instead of changing the town for a night it changed the entire world forever in a single night the world became filled with characters from pop culture people who dressed as demons became demons and people who dressed as superheroes gained superhuman power the end result was the apocalypse
7045493 it was the end of humanity instead of normal homo sapien sapiens my world is filled with mage meta humans martial artists youkai mad geniuses and summoners they even have alien species in colorado
7045494 magia the city of magic its one of the big three colonies with machina the city of machines and sunnydale the nexus my family is originally from sunnydale but i moved to magia to increase of magical knowledge
7045495 correct that is how other universes perceive our universe imagination is a connection to creation which enables us to see all possibilities in one universe sir arthur conan doyle wrote stories of the great detective sherlock holmes but in another universe sherlock holmes really did solve the great mysteries
7045496 but i watched the halloween episode online that spell worked fine
7045497 my universe isnt common or canon as its sometimes called its a crossover universe
7045498 we managed to find at least two series scanning the net
7045499 x men evolution in our world an animated series based on a series of comic books and centered around teenage mutants in the town of bayville the other is gi joe an 80s animated series based around military action figures
7045500 you mean all this insanity with mutants and invasions is entertainment to someone
7045501 so my cousin was right we are nothing more than gods toys
7045502 take comfort in the people who dream of your world are merely dreams of others either a dull dreaming of adventure or action filled dreaming of peace they themselves may be nothing more than dreams
7045503 when this skip passed threw the barrier a dimension surrounding my worlds reality it absorbed a large amount of chaos magic the magic was drained from the ship into a set of special storage seals to prevent it from harming us what the cube does is drain the magic from the seals into it and the seals will convert it into the original spell
7045504 this spell wont be at full power and your not dressed as a specific character so you should become a generic anbu version of yourself with your persona inheriting the knowledge and skills
7045505 it was very confusing having a second set of memories an entire life time of memories added to my own it was like i was a reincarnated soul regaining what was stolen by lethes water after several hours on confusion and some sleep the others began to tell me there origins
7045506 on my version of earth during our twenty second century a plague known as crimson ravaged the earth the epidemic killed millions before hope was found in one small village a child possessing regenerative abilities was found by the government codenamed adam the boy produced cures for diseases minutes to hours after exposure they used this ability to not only cure the crimson but thousands of others the government feared another pandemic apocalypse so they began genetic research on adam and eventually began to replicate his healing powers this lead to creation of a hundred children born with healing factors due to there feral nature in later life the enhanced were given the second name therians by the media theria is greek meaning wild beast and changing into an animal is called therianthopy the public and other governments were upset with the creation of the therians until there healing factors managed to wipe out most of the worlds diseases there will still religious figures and politicians that spoke against there creation but the benefits soon washed them away i remember reading about a religious politician running against therians saying they were abominations in the eyes of god when his son was cured of a terminal disease using a therians healing factor his wife walked up to him and slapped him on national tv and demanded a divorce from the fool later genetic testing uncovered a second special child codenamed eve who possessed vast mental abilities that made her mind computer like this lead to a new generation of enhanced the beta generation of enhanced possessed both the healing factor and kinetic mind the beta generation lead to vast progress in technology especially biotechnology and space exploration they were physically and mentally superior to normal homo sapiens sapiens which lead to a conflict average humans were jealous of there abilities and feared them which lead to hate groups appearing on the other side the enhanced thought normal humans were violent weak and mostly inferior eventually the majority of beta enhanced established space colonies and the first mars colony
7045507 yes most of them did in fact many of the beta enhanced were modified for living in space there cells were made more resistant to radiation poisoning and cancer there bones never became brittle from low gravity and they were less effected by decompression sickness there enhanced minds were also fortified against the mental illnesses that plague space travelers the problem was the hatred on earth didnt die down and eventually reached people in power on one august 11 at 1100 colony time a nuclear weapon destroyed colony ares the destruction of the colony killed nearly a million enhanced but the fall of the colony to earth caused an extinction level event
7045508 a massive explosion on impact and towering tsunamis were the first effect the second was the world burning as fragments of rocks and dust from the explosion falling back to earth the friction in the atmosphere caused so much thermal radiation that ever exposed flammable object on earth ignited after the fire came the ice as the clouds of smoke and ash cut off the light of the sun the healing factors of the alpha and beta enhanced on earth allowed them to survive easier than the normal humans they could heal severe wounds easily while humans became helpless without hospitals while the cold took human strength and ravaged there immune systems the enhanced could tolerate the cold extremes and were immune to every imaginable disease in the end the enhanced controlled earth post meteor and eventually developed the nanomedicine nanotechnology to convert normal humans into enhanced
7045509 why didnt you use that stuff instead of your friends nanomedicine
7045510 in my time line homo sapien sapiens have been extinct for centuries there was no longer a need for general nanomedicine since everyone possesses a healing factor now dont interrupt because this is were things start to get weird a century after meteor the government experimented with new ftl faster than light space travel technology what you would call hyperspace travel one classified experiment uncovered the secret of time travel and a terrorist group known as purity managed to break into the base purity was part of remaining human minority who refused genetic engineering and felt oppressed by the enhanced the original plan of the group was to travel back to before meteor and prevent the destruction of ares the event which caused normal humans to loss there race against the enhanced the plan failed when the ship appeared during the detonation of nuke instead of before it the massive energy surge caused the ship to crash in the distant past with all except one of the crew dead from the impact heat and the gamma radiation the dying survivor found himself in a small town destroyed by the impact he found a badly injured woman the sole survivor of the town and out of guilt injected her with the nanomedicine before he died the woman who was a couple weeks pregnant at the time survived and gave birth to the first beta enhanced the child who historians later codenamed deus managed to keep his remarkable abilities hidden and eventually married a normal woman centuries later the descendants of deus and his wife became the progenitors adam and eve
7045511 the effect happens before the event they go back to stop the enhanced and end up causing there creation
7045512 we also learned that our worlds history cant be changed the temporal law states you cant change the past only create a past you cant change the future only make the future
7045513 if you did make a change you would only create an alternate reality separate from the original
7045514 the crimson plague was also caused by the time travelers when the remains of the ship were recovered from the bottom of the lake
7045515 the gamma mutated microbes were released into the atmosphere when the bioship breached the lakes surface
7045516 im getting to this i told you about alphas possessing healing factors and beta possessing both healing factors and kinetic memory but there is the third type of enhanced known as gamma enhanced or psions they were later created when scientists tried to further enhance mental abilities and unlocked psychic abilities eventually a third generation of enhanced was created possessing a selection of special abilities
7045517 what are your powers if you dont mind me asking
7045518 telepathy memory manipulation cyberpathy psychometry and psychokinesis all linked to my sense of touch
7045519 i can communicate and manipulate a persons memories by coming in physical contact psychometry is the ability to relate details about the past or future condition of an object person or location usually by being in close contact with it the tactile telekinesis grants me superhuman strength and speed nigh invulnerability and the ability to fly
7045520 the one on the left is randolph wolfgang mercer codename fenrir a violent a class criminal wanted for countless crimes hes an ancient therian possessing superior regeneration and mutant ability to transform into a wolf or a more powerful hybrid form the one on the right is lord dragos mikhail sokolov codename orlock hes a mutant psion possessing an extreme version of hydrokinesis the ability to psycho kinetically manipulate water he uses this ability to manipulate the water in his body granting him shape shifting abilities including animal morphing elasticity liquification and sublimation hes even able to use his blood as a weapon creating cutting whips or solid throwing needles hes also an a class criminal the one in the middle is a mystery he known as the doctor and is a s class criminal wanted for illegal genetic experimentation mostly human experimentation he also freed fenrir and orlock in order to break into evans labs the doctor somehow learned of my my fathers temporal probe project it was project in which special probes invisible and intangible when cloaked would be sent back in time to create a accurate record of past events and recover parts of our lost history it would allows us to get a true unbiased record not contaminate by the victors the doctor and his men used the technology they stole to travel back in time to an alternate time line to another world this world
7045521 the trail threw dimensions was decaying rapidly and it would take far too long for the authorities to get authorization to go after them my father my father was killed in the attack and wanted them to pay so i used the files i found in the doctors computer and the second prototype to go after him during my journey i encountered a trap the doctor set and ended up on chase and kusanagis alternate earth they managed to acquire this ship and offered to join me in the adventure
7045522 the doctor and his partners have been on his world for years if not decades
7045523 the technology used by those weapon plus goons was reverse engineered from technology from valaries world
7045524 i ended up helping because the ninja spell gave me an inflated sense of responsibility
7045525 a clandestine program of the united states government the programs purpose is the creation of super soldiers intended to fight the wars of the future especially a mutant human war the ultimate goal of weapon plus is the total extermination of mutant kind the infamous weapon x was the tenth installation of weapon plus but eventually it branched off and became an independent program with similar purposes
7045526 when my world was transformed it became a very dangerous place inhabited by fictional beings
7045527 you couldnt always trust what you see as something sweet and innocent could turn out to be lethal
7045528 an adorable little child that turns out to be a psychopath
7045529 out of safety people read and watched the media and created the files a collection of plots of profiles from various shows movies books comic books and japanese anime
7045530 arariels main computer contains the files but can only be accessed by someone of enough clearance
7045531 they have files on everyone including the history and secret identities of superheroes not all of them are censored
7045532 please note that the files contain the most canon versions of characters this world contains many differences
7045533 so far we know this world visibly separates from canon time line when toad was abandoned and found by gi joe the different crossovers and histories were revealed later
7045534 the black fury and that movie version with toad played by ray park are in this
7045535 they even have alternate future versions like those mutants from the future we encountered while the x mansion and misfit mansion were being repaired most of it is blacked out because we dont have clearance but even these little bits of information are major
7045536 i always thought our lives are like a messed up comic books
7045537 we already informed you about the nuclear self destruct on eden island
7045538 its not just the island several secret bases in the united states and canada have been discovered in the last few hours they have been revealed because they are dead
7045539 all the personal on the base soldiers scientists and others are dead they range from reduced to ashes to torn to pieces like out of a 80s horror movie
7045540 they would be discarded as normal if they werent all occurring now and have a same theme
7045541 he died of a painful death via a brain aneurysm in his cell
7045542 several politicians with strong anti mutant policies have died as well one was killed in a car accident the second with a history of high blood pressure died of heart attack the third overdosed on his cocaine and was dead by the time his servants found him and the fourth was stabbed to death by his wife after she found out about his mistress
7045543 purity and foh have also lost several key members one fell off the subway platform and was run over by a train passing threw the second was drinking and crashed his car into a concrete divider the third was arrested for child molestation and was murdered in prison the fourth committed suicide when his company went under the fifth died working on his houses fuse book the sixth
7045544 the numbers keep growing he already have thirty possible but there could be more under the radar
7045545 its not just in north america iran japan china russia north korea syria france politicians military officials members of hate groups and others have been killed in everything from household accidents to terrorist bombings
7045546 i just got another report i sent people to trail and get information on agent johnson the man who gave us the mission to eden island
7045547 the investigation was going no where until a few hours ago when all of opposition died agent johnson was a soldier with strong anti mutant views reported dead in the middle east he was recruited by a black ops government project who arranged his death his physical trail lead to the secret base that was completely cremated
7045548 titans i want you to come back to the base with misfits
7045549 i want to keep things close until things have settled down
7045550 as long as you dont try to steal the technology or download our computer files we have no problems
7045551 well copy wildshadows mass device amplifier and transmitter mdat signal and follow them
7045552 the original mass device allowed cobra to steal buildings and monuments
7045553 trinitys upgraded version should be able to handle two ships even powered by grape juice
7045554 we managed to recover video footage from the cremated base apparently some of the men were extremely paranoid and placed digital spy cameras in the private meeting room there was a camera hidden in the ceiling protected by a adamantium fire box we decrypted the files and managed to recover the last few minutes
7045555 due to the help of an unknown metahuman team codename titans all members of misfit team survived attacks and escaped before the failsafe activated
7045556 we will need to create a new scenario including the new team
7045557 in fact everyone in the facility beyond his room is dead
7045558 my name is eve as to how i can control people
7045559 oh do you prefer strain after all your not human your a sentient bacterial life form that arose during the beginnings of life on earth with the rise of multicellular lifeforms you found endless numbers of hosts you could infect however mutant kind some of whom were immune to your infection eventually arose and multiplied becoming the first threat to your domination
7045560 part of the very hatred and fear of mutants was caused by you but you took more direct actions one of those actions involved experimenting on a young mutant girl named maya in attempt to develop a method to infect other mutants the project failed and the girl died but some of your greedier scientists sold the organs and those of other test subjects on the black market since the subjects died of nerve damage they didnt see the problem donating hearts kidneys and livers
7045561 one of mayas kidneys was transplanted into a singer named melissa pearce the kidney produced mutated sublime bacteria that made her ill which was made worse when her doctor advised her to take immunosuppressant drugs not being able to detect you a recent overdose cause her immune system to fail and the bacteria nearly destroyed the body until melissa mutant ability awoke she possesses the ability to assimilate ambient organic matter to repair her own cells a healing factor that doubled as an immune system converting bacteria fungi prions and viruses into new cells she absorbed the mutating sublime bacteria and i was born
7045562 i am a shape shifter manipulating all my cells and can infect other animals to control them i can assimilate organic matter to regenerate from even a single cell i also possess the ability to ignite organic matter especially living creatures the second i entered this room your fate was sealed
7045563 backup plan the samples of yourself you have hidden away to ensure your survival most of them have been destroyed and i would be more concerned with that new drug your spreading the scientists came down with a case of parasite eve
7045564 with its command destroyed including sublime and the director dead the organization will collapse
7045565 the agent coated the documents with a nano medicine memory eraser it infects the person who touches the documents and then at the correct time or by trigger erases the persons memory back to the period of infection
7045566 there was an eighty percent chance of erasing parts of his long term memory and a twenty percent chance of mental illness from the strain they were using
7045567 parasite eve handled it the misfits serve the purpose of showing mutant potential and we dont want them crippled by having there commanders suffering mental illness well more than usual
7045568 im surprised the girl managed to survive her exile to that nexus evans and her little group have arrived far too late to stop our plans
7045569 a faith in the simple dreams of american people the insistence on small miracles
7045570 we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states there are patriots who opposed the war in iraq and patriots who supported it we are one people all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes all of us defending the united states of america
7045571 though the words are but nine among more than two thousand obama intended them as a trumpet call of faith no longer he was saying would the political fault lines in america fall between a religious right and a secular left instead a religious left was finding its voice here mansfield creates a fictional third person religious left voice to state his opinion the words in the book are italicized as though quoted but they are in fact mansfields own conclusions we too have faith they proclaimed those of us on the political left who believe in a womans right to choose an abortion and who defend the rights of our gay friends and who care for the poor and who trust that big government can be a tool of righteousness we also love god we too have spiritual passion and we believe that our vision for america arises from a vital faith as well no longer will we be painted as the non believers no longer will we yield the spiritual high ground the religious right has nothing on us anymore
7045572 he doesnt accept everything that traditional christianity hands him and he doesnt believe everything within scripture is inspired so that leads him to come to politics with a bit of pick and choose approach to theology
7045573 nach den uns vorliegenden informationen hat russland seinen r ckzug aus georgien begonnen aber nicht vollst ndig abgeschlossen

7045593 delaware can get another senator but my boys cant get another dad
7045594 he has taught law on saturday mornings at widener university since 1991 his income is his 165 200 senate salary and 20 500 from teaching in a 2005 ranking of the 100 senators for wealth he was 99th in other words unlike most other presidential contenders he isnt a millionaire
7045595 but the player said that he wished to go a little bit higher and get into the championship and so it has proved
7045596 it just shows that we were on the right lines i think with our scouting system
7045597 we knew that it was a bit of a long shot in a way once i had seen him i knew that this young man could play football
7045598 we have missed out because the lad went into the championship but it shows that we are looking at the right things
7045599 i am expecting a pretty quiet week on the transfer front
7045600 we have got three big games and i think that is enough for us to deal with if we have any problems that we just suddenly pick up then we might have to look at it
7045601 ik wil mijn hartelijke dank tot uitdrukking brengen voor de vele bloemen uit nederland
7045602 ik schuif even op want anders poept ie straks naar beneden
7045603 dont you think most newspeople at the missourinet as well as those at newspapers radio stations and tv stations throughout the state and the country have signed up for the same text message and will immediately broadcast it or post it
7045604 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
7045605 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7045606 i have not selected him as i do not think he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7045607 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game i shall talk to the player tomorrow he is our player and we shall work with him at training
7045608 in the presence of god and of christ jesus who will judge the living and the dead and in view of his appearing and his kingdom i give you this charge preach the word be prepared in season and out of season correct rebuke and encourage with great patience and careful instruction for the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine instead to suit their own desires they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear they will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths but you keep your head in all situations endure hardship do the work of an evangelist discharge all the duties of your ministry for i am already being poured out like a drink offering and the time has come for my departure i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing
7045609 im already be poured out like a drink offering and the time has come for my departure the word paul employs is the same as is used to describe oxen unyoked at the end of the day like one who weighs anchor and heads for the final destination or an individual striking tent and heading home in view of my passing timothy i want you to do this
7045610 woe is me if i do not preach the gospel
7045611 to convert one sinner from his way is an event of greater importance than the deliverance of an entire kingdom from temporal evil
7045612 dr barclay we all really like you but i have to tell you something we cant understand a word youre saying
7045613 for the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine
7045614 today the evangelical church is in a life and death struggle with this spiritual alternative even as the apostles in the new testament period today this pagan spirituality comes in sophisticated psychological language it sounds plausible compelling and even commendable but let us make no mistake about it it is lethal to biblical christianity that is why the biggest enigma we face today is the fact that its chief enablers are evangelical churches
7045615 let no one among you think of himself more highly than he ought but each with sober judgment according to the grace that has been given to us
7045616 some will love thee some will hate thee some will praise thee some will slight cease from man and look above thee trust in god and do whats right
7045617 is the pulpit of gods love drawing people again and again to the cross keeping evangelism at the very heart of all were doing
7045618 tomorrow i undergo my trials before the presbytery may god give me courage in the hour of need what should i fear if god see fit to put me in the ministry who shall keep me back if i be not fit why should i go forward to your service i desire to dedicate myself over and over again
7045619 and honored by a high and holy calling let me never forget that i am but a man of dust and ashes a man with all the natural faults and passions that plague the race of man i pray you therefore my lord and my redeemer save me from myself and from all the injuries i may do myself while endeavoring to bless others fill me with your power by the holy spirit and i will go in strength and tell of your righteousness i will spread abroad the message of redeeming love while my earthly life shall last
7045620 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly
7045621 come that you might have life and might have it more abundantly
7045622 defile not ye yourselves in any of these things sodomy incest adultery bestiality for in all these the nations are defiled which i cast out before you that the land spue not you out also when ye defile it as it spued out the nations that were before you
7045623 o america america thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee translate thou that persecutest wbc how often would i have agthered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate
7045624 the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
7045625 hes been very special i actually wanted to take him out in the sixth inning but he pleaded begged told me hed be ok he said i cant come out of this game i said ok go get em and he went out and got em
7045626 i told manuel that i felt good that i just wanted to stay out there
7045627 i told him i dont want to come out of the game before roy
7045628 i pray that mccain chooses romney i heard him on this show or that program and he is the smartest guy in the room he understands the issues and is an economic guru that is what we need
7045629 i dont think theyre making a statement at all they just want to shock everyone
7045630 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7045631 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7045632 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7045633 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7045634 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7045635 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7045636 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7045649 we want a simple approach in an energy bar not complicated formulas or gimmicks dont you its just an approach that makes sense clif bars are a great tasting convenient source of energy for any activity to perform at your best the last thing you want to put in your body is a synthetic product thats why we believe in using healthy ingredients such as organic rolled oats organic roasted soybeans organic milled flaxseed and organic soy flour all 16 clif bar flavors are made with 70 organic ingredients its your body you decide with a mix of carbohydrates protein and fiber clif bar is a moderate glycemic index food what does this mean basically youll benefit from a steady increase in blood sugar levels followed by a gradual decline sustained energy know what that means you keep going eat a clif bar 1 2 hours before a workout or race and youll avoid the sugar high and crash associated with refined ingredients and sweeteners a clif bar delivers the boost you need without unwanted crash and burn you dont have to be an athlete to enjoy a clif bar but with the extra energy a clif bar provides you may find it hard not to be
7045650 clif shot bloks chews the latest energy food option for endurance athletes variety is the spice of life we couldnt agree more we understand cause weve been there that after numerous hours of training and racing the body needs to mix it up a little in terms of what goes in the tank thats why we set out to create another energy food option that would complement our bars and gels the result is clif shot bloks chews theyre simple to handle easy to chew and provide similar nutrition to shot gel so theyll fit seamlessly into your training and racing nutrition program nutrition carbohydrates and electrolytes shot bloks chews offer very similar nutrition to shot energy gel the primary ingredient for both is brown rice syrup which provides easily assimilated carbohydrates for working muscles both products also provide the mineral salts known as electrolytes these electrolytes allow electrical impulses to travel properly throughout your body permitting normal bodily function when you sweat you start to deplete your electrolyte stores and experience potential performance decline so its best to help replenish them through food and fluid intake one of our newest flavors margarita w salt provides 210 mg of sodium which is 3 times the amount in other flavors sodium is the key electrolyte lost in sweat lose too much and performance declines dramatically including a higher likelihood of muscle cramping for hot days or for those that perspire excessively margarita w salt is the way to go we created shot bloks chews each in a 10g size so that 3 chews provide 100 calories that makes it easy to track caloric intake during long outings there are 6 chews to a double serve package so one package provides 200 calories clif shot bloks chews are the first product in the shot line to be usda certified organic which means that each flavor contains a minimum of 95 organic ingredients we strive to use the most sustainable ingredients possible in our products the environmental benefits of buying organic ingredients for our products have a direct positive impact on the air and water quality on this planet clif shot bloks chews are usda certified organic by quality assurance international qai
7045651 raising healthy and active children these days is not easy we thought it was time for kids to have their very own clif bar to encourage lots of play and healthy eating its an organic baked whole grain energy bar filled with the nutrients that growing bodies need without unnecessary fat and sugar and its from clif bar where weve always been about nourishing healthy people with great food

7045662 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7045663 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7045664 t zal een keer gebeuren dat zie je nu maar
7045665 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7045666 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7045667 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7045668 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7045669 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7045670 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7045671 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7045672 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7045674 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7045675 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7045676 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7045677 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7045678 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7045679 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7045680 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7045681 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7045682 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7045683 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7045684 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7045685 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7045686 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7045687 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7045688 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7045689 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7045690 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

7045694 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7045695 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7045696 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7045697 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7045698 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7045699 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7045700 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7045701 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7045702 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7045703 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7045704 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7045705 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7045706 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7045707 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7045708 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7045709 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7045710 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7045711 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7045712 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7045713 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7045714 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7045715 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7045716 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7045717 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7045718 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7045719 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7045720 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7045721 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7045722 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7045723 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7045724 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7045725 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7045726 with over 30 years of baggage accumulated in the u s senate biden is not the kind of running mate you would think of for someone who has campaigned on a pledge to change the way politics is done in washington
7045727 but it does signal that obama may be more of a realist than his rhetoric suggests
7045728 and shows that the change candidate has decided that a wealth of experience may be important to an administration after all
7045729 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7045730 watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on www barackobama com spread the word
7045731 would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7045732 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7045733 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7045734 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7045735 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7045736 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7045737 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7045738 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7045739 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7045740 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7045741 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7045742 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7045743 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7045744 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7045745 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7045746 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7045747 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7045748 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7045749 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7045750 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7045751 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

7045753 i do not think that he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7045754 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well
7045755 the andy that i know is a comic genius the andy that i know loves his kids the andy that i know loves the people he works with
7045756 joes a good guy we all criticize each other during this time but for joe biden to talk about qualifications hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a business
7045757 barack obama and joe biden are the leaders who will bring the change our country needs
7045758 an old white demosaur whos been around washington forever 1972
7045759 this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood whos a professor of english in chicago who i know and who i have not received some official endorsement from hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
7045760 and the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense george
7045761 so this kind of game in which anybody who i know regardless of how flimsy the relationship is is somehow somehow their ideas could be attributed to me i think the american people are smarter than that theyre not going to suggest somehow that that is reflective of my views because it obviously isnt
7045762 bill ayers lives in his neighborhood their kids attend the same school
7045763 theyre certainly friendly they know each other as anyone whose kids go to school together
7045764 t heres a constant chess match between the middles of which way theyre going to hit wrist away or cross body players are always getting more information about where the set is split second information about the approach angle of the hitters and factoring into that the history david lee taking that all into account making an amazing blocking move
7045765 hasta ahora estados unidos ha sido el abogado de rusia cuando se trataba de integrar ese pa s en la comunidad mundial hemos apoyado su entrada en el grupo de las ocho principales naciones industrializadas y celebramos su deseo de ingresar en la omc
7045766 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7045767 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7045768 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7045769 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7045770 we knew coming in that we may never have this experience again so we are lucky that everything went well and we got what we wanted
7045771 i think he has played very well in the olympic tournament
7045772 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor
7045773 i think it the game had been played in another part of the day it would have been very different
7045774 die mannschaft wird geschlossen und kompakt auftreten das wird f r uns eine ganz enge kiste
7045775 ik hou van paarden en ik hou niet van oorlog pesten en racisme
7045776 i guess if you play long enough youre bound to get some milestones more importantly we won we needed this game

7045779 no thanks im on my way to new york to break into public television
7045780 my idea that hed potentially make a good vp candidate surely ranks among this blogs most embarrassing errors in judgment
7045781 i would like to see these items addressed before i put this place on the market
7045782 the furnace is 15 years old put in a new furnace
7045783 s avonds ontspon zich een verhitte discussie en iedereen was het erover eens dat dit niet door de beugel kon toen ik de vlag naar beneden haalde werd ik overmeesterd door de beveiliging van het evenement en overgedragen aan de politie
7045784 ik wil namelijk de discussie openhouden wat wel en niet is toegestaan in de kunst wat mij betreft zijn daar grenzen aan de nederlandse vlag staat symbool voor onze bevochten vrijheden en is iets om trots op te zijn
7045785 ik sta voor 100 procent achter mijn daad maar ik sta op het punt af te studeren en moet dus straks solliciteren dan kan een eventuele veroordeling in mijn nadeel werken al reken ik daar niet op
7045786 op de dag van de moord was ik op verkiezingscampagne in doetinchem
7045787 ik was gewoon in doetinchem na een bezoek aan enschede en hield daar een toespraak voor bestuurders politie en brandweer
7045788 het leek wel alsof ze om de hoek de dader hadden staan opwachten
7045789 wanneer jij deze stukken naar buiten brengt dan heb ik een wapen dat voor jou absoluut en onherroepelijk dodelijk is
7045790 pas op het is heel onverstandig van u om met nijeboer te praten
7045791 de verlichting is feitelijk niet meer dan een krachtige maar ook specifieke belichting van de werkelijkheid de verlichting is een spotje dat leidt tot een versmalling van de blik
7045792 je moet leren om verder te kijken dan de stereotiepe beelden denk bijvoorbeeld aan de sharia de islamitische wetgeving wij zijn snel geneigd om voortdurend te focussen op de kwalijke kanten daarvan een studente uit damascus vertelde me laatst indringend dat wij daarvoor de ogen niet moeten sluiten maar dat we als gevolg van ons individualistische denkraam niet zien dat die sharia ook moet worden gelezen als een tekst waarin wordt uitgedrukt wat werkelijk van groot belang in de samenleving is en wat echt goed beschermd moet worden gezin familie gemeenschap wat dat betreft hebben moslims ook een vitale traditie van waaruit zij het maatschappelijke debat impulsen kunnen geven
7045793 dat betreft dan zelfs soms tekenaars of webloggende leden van het parlement wanneer die zich beroepend op een niet echt correcte interpretatie van de vrijheid van meningsuiting zich het denken te kunnen permitteren medeburgers in hun diepste overtuigingen te kunnen kwetsen vrijheid van meningsuiting is nooit absoluut maar moet in zijn overigens niet mis te verstane grote belang wel worden gewogen met het feit dat die vrijheid wordt gebruikt in verantwoordelijkheid jegens elkaar persvrijheid is geen pestvrijheid we merken deze dagen dat discussies over als vrijheid van meningsuiting uitgevente maar als kwetsend bedoelde tekeningen van wat voor islamieten heilig is zich niet langer binnen de grenzen van de natiestaten laten opsluiten dat geeft een nieuw perspectief op de grenzen van het toelaatbare en wellicht ook een discussie over de vraag of we nog wel kunnen omgaan met dingen die heilig zijn daar oog voor hebben daarbij passen leiders die de burgers streng durven te corrigeren als dat nodig is
7045794 we hebben geen reservepotje voor deze nieuwe tegenvaller bij de noord zuidlijn
7045795 dan heeft u voorlopig dus een kolossaal financieel probleem is er een reservepotje
7045796 wij hebben jullie in de gaten gehouden u bent gewoon op de verkeerde plaats op de verkeerde tijd het is een adminstratieve aanhouding
7045797 enkel de mensen die de politiebevelen in de wind sloegen zijn administratief opgepakt telkens hebben de politieagenten de manifestanten gevraagd zich te verspreiden alvorens werd ingegrepen
7045798 ik heb een hekel aan het knuffelen van moslims het is walgelijk dat de pvda top zo erg bezig is met het idee dat ze moslims niet mogen verliezen
7045799 verricht onderzoek naar personen en organisaties die een bedreiging kunnen vormen voor de democratische rechtsorde de staatsveiligheid of andere gewichtige belangen van de staat
7045800 op internet voltrekt zich een nieuwe seksuele revolutie onder jongeren en ontstaan er vele nieuwe seksuele contacten de huidige generatie jongeren tussen de 12 en 18 jaar maakt er massaal gebruik van
7045801 80 procent van de jongens en 85 procent van de meisjes vindt dat je hiervoor moet oppassen
7045802 een pedofiel is gek op een kind en wil het helemaal niet misbruiken ze hebben geen behoefte aan penetraties omdat zij weten dat kinderen daar niet op gebouwd zijn maar wanneer in een sfeer van wederzijds respect een intimiteitbeleving bepaalde seksuele handelingen gebeuren bijvoorbeeld wederzijds masturberen hoeft dat niet slecht te zijn
7045803 ik kan ook wel op een knaapje vallen men gaat ervan uit dat je met een kind geen erotische verhouding kan hebben zonder het te benadelen kinderen zouden minder verstandig zijn en niet goed duidelijk kunnen maken wat ze wel of niet willen onzin alle leeftijdsgrenzen moeten gewoon uit de zedelijkheidswetgeving worden geschrapt
7045804 in nederland houden we het liefst elkaars hand vast gaat het kabinet onder de kerstboom liederen zitten zingen en schuiven we alle rotzooi onder het tapijt
7045805 als nieuwe partij moet je je gezicht laten zien van friesland tot limburg door de beveiliging wordt dat natuurlijk een enorm circus maar ik doe het wel en vind het hartstikke leuk samen met fleur en alle andere kandidaten trekken we het land in daar laat ik mij door niets of niemand van weerhouden
7045806 zoals het er nu voor staat kan ik gaan en staan waar ik wil ik maak mij geen zorgen
7045807 het wisselt bij de n staan we op nul bij de ander op vier de campagne is nog maar net begonnen ik weet zeker dat die tien zetels die metro eergisteren voorspelde er in zitten
7045808 ik merk het in het land tijdens het flyeren er wordt ontzettend enthousiast op geert en de rest gereageerd
7045809 we doen niet aan koetjes en kalfjes maar hebben een heel duidelijk verhaal
7045810 er zijn overeenkomsten maar ook een boel verschillen wij willen een immigratiestop pastors niet wij willen een verbod op de dubbele nationaliteit pastors niet wij willen geen nieuwe moskee n erbij pastors wil dat weer wel wij zeggen jongens we hebben nu even genoeg islam in nederland dat heb ik pastors nog niet horen zeggen
7045811 duidelijkheid en lef deze campagne zoeken we niet naar het compromis macht is voor ons een instrument om onze doelen te bereiken het gaat ons om de wensen van de kiezer wij zijn een partij die ergens voor staat en zullen nooit zoals d66 heeft gedaan onze ziel verkopen om alleen maar op dat pluche terecht te komen we willen meeregeren maar wel op onze voorwaarden
7045812 wij staan voor een strenger immigratie en integratiebeleid fors lagere belastingen fatsoenlijke zorg voor ouderen en goed onderwijs dat is een authentiek geluid en daar zijn wij trots op en ik denk dat dit veel mensen aanspreekt
7045813 dat zijn er meer dan je denkt het viel zelfs rita verdonk onlangs nog op tijdens een bezoek aan de haagse schilderswijk de burka deugt qua veiligheid niet je moet mensen meteen kunnen identificeren het is een middeleeuws gebruik een middel om vrouwen in een tweederangs positie te dringen tevens is het een grote n tegen de nederlandse samenleving als je een burka draagt zal je nooit een baan vinden in nederland als je hem toch wilt dragen ga dan alsjeblieft naar saudi arabi jemen of iran daar kun je nog kiezen tussen verschillende kleuren of maten
7045814 verdonk gaat zich nu toch weer buigen over een verbod ik heb goede hoop dat dat er komt
7045815 dat is een verkeerd beeld ik ben juist een rasoptimist nederland is een prachtig land en kan nog zoveel beter worden dan zullen we alleen wel de problemen eerlijk moeten benoemen
7045816 we moeten het hebben over de subsidies de te grote overheid en de problemen met islam en integratie
7045817 de hufterigheid op straat de slechte scholen en de criminaliteit die maar niet wordt aangepakt in nederland houden we het liefst elkaars hand vast gaat het kabinet onder de kerstboom liederen zitten zingen en schuiven we alle rotzooi onder het tapijt dat is heel gezellig maar het land wordt er niet beter van we zullen problemen moeten benoemen en oplossingen aan moeten dragen dat noem ik optimisme
7045818 eigenlijk niet zoveel als ze als iets goeds hebben gedaan dan is het wellicht dat het begrotingstekort bijna is verdwenen wel heeft hij het thema van normen en waarden op de agenda gezet en toch is het nog steeds zo dat het onfatsoen in nederland heerst nog steeds kan je ongestraft hoer zeggen tegen een trambestuurster nog steeds zitten die ouderen in een luier omdat ze niet op tijd naar het toilet kunnen in een verzorgingstehuis nog steeds zijn n op de vijf marokkaanse jongeren als verdachte bij politie geregistreerd nog steeds zijn die grenzen wagenwijd open nog steeds is het gezin niet wat het zou moeten zijn en ontsporen er nog steeds heel veel kinderen
7045819 het debat over normen en waarden heeft alleen holle frasen opgeleverd
7045820 je kunt veel van balkenende zeggen maar het is tenminste geen socialist
7045821 het was natuurlijk af en toe een vervelende vent maar ik was een groot fan van hem hij durfde wel op te schrijven wat hij vond daar heb je er nu nog maar weinig van in nederland gelukkig hebben we binnenkort een debat in de kamer om na te gaan wat is de rol geweest van de aivd en van het kabinet en dat is noodzakelijk nederland heeft namelijk nog steeds haar lesje niet geleerd het beleid is nog steeds niet veranderd het terrorisme ligt nog steeds op de loer
7045822 een nieuwe bepaling voor moleculaire dimensies stomverbaasd zal einstein zijn geweest toen men dit wel wist te waarderen
7045823 bangladesh heeft te kampen met de grootste massavergiftiging uit de geschiedenis
7045824 deze lijst geeft een overzicht van stoffen die geacht worden een bijzondere bedreiging te vormen voor bodem water en lucht
7045825 het in het milieu brengen van deze stoffen dient gezien hun eigenschappen vermeden te worden voor deze stoffen wordt een maximale brongerichte aanpak voorgestaan
7045826 geachte heer van rooij u toont al jaren een hoge mate van betrokkenheid bij het milieu ik waardeer het zeer wanneer burgers blijk geven van hun bezorgdheid voor een beter milieu u legt echter een zeer groot tijdsbeslag op mijn medewerkers ik ben van mening dat dit tijdsbeslag een thans niet meer te verantwoorden omvang is gaan aannemen u noopt mij daarom u mee te delen dat uw brieven voortaan voor kennisgeving zullen worden aangenomen een inhoudelijke beantwoording zal niet meer plaatsvinden hoogachtend de minister van vrom
7045827 kruistocht tegen sluipmoordenaar ge mpregneerd hout rampzalig voor mens en milieu
7045828 als ik niet eens mag weten welke chemicali n er in dat alternatieve middel zitten
7045829 daar het jaarlijks in het milieu brengen van 16 000 kilo arseenzuur en 19 000 kilo chroom vi een bijzonder ernstige overtreding is van de wet milieubeheer
7045830 was de inspectie wettelijk verplicht mij onmiddellijk een verbod op te leggen de inspectie heeft dit nagelaten en mij zelfs gedwarsboomd bij het overschakelen op een milieuvriendelijk alternatief als gevolg daarvan heb ik sinds december 1994 n g eens 24 000 kilo arseen en 29 000 kilo chroom vi zijnde zwartelijststoffen in het milieu gebracht zonder dat mij een strobreed in de weg is gelegd wilt u zo vriendelijk zijn een onderzoek in te stellen naar deze gang van zaken
7045831 in de commissievergadering van 28 augustus 1996 is besloten uw brief voor kennisgeving aan te nemen
7045832 dit houdt in dat de commissie meent geen actie te moeten ondernemen de leden adviseren u contact op te nemen met de nationale ombudsman
7045833 daarmee worden de omwonenden die die lucht wel m eten inademen vogelvrij verklaard
7045834 en om de ramp compleet te maken wordt van de giftige vliegassen die overblijven cement beton asfalt en baksteen gemaakt
7045835 het op verantwoorde wijze verwerken en verwijderen van chemische afvalstoffen
7045836 te gek voor woorden dat de boel niet wordt gesaneerd
7045837 maar meneer reijnders als de stichting natuur en milieu zich al twintig jaar ongerust maakt over al dat arsenicum waarom heeft de stichting natuur en milieu er dan zo weinig tegen gedaan waarom bijvoorbeeld nooit een kort geding aangespannen tegen het ministerie van vrom dat aantoonbaar zijn eigen milieuwetgeving overtrad
7045838 natuur en milieu mikt niet primair op lobbyen in den haag
7045839 de heer van rooy heeft met ons al jarenlang correspondentie gevoerd over de problematiek van verduurzaamd hout daarbij heeft vrom steeds aangegeven dat het probleem van verduurzaamd hout al in de jaren 80 door vrom is onderkend echter het ontbrak aan normering t a v verschillende stoffen en juridische titels om de gewraakte stoffen te verbieden deze mogelijkheid is pas begin jaren 90 ontstaan via beoordelingen door het ctb vanaf dat moment heeft het ministerie van vrom zich beijverd voor het verbieden van zowel gecreosoteerd hout als van met wolmanzouten ge mpregneerd hout het verbod op gecreosoteerd hout is enkele jaren geleden ge ffectueerd het verbod op het gebruik van wolmanzouten stuit telkenmale op tegenstand van de europese commissie de europese commissie betwijfelt de schadelijkheid en bestrijdt het opwerpen van handelsbelemmeringen wel is de europese commissie nederland tegemoet gekomen met het verbod op het gebruik van arseenhoudende stoffen echter dit alleen voor een beperkt aantal toepassingen de inzet van vrom t a v de arseenrichtlijn van de eu is daarbij nog immer een breed verbod op wolmanzouten deze lijn zullen we bij de europese commissie verdedigen in deze reactie ben ik bewust niet ingegaan op een aantal onjuistheden in het artikel maar de slotpassage inzake avr chemie wil ik niet onbesproken laten de in deze passage gedane suggestie van een overheid die ten behoeve van avr chemie valsheid in geschrift pleegt is volstrekt absurd en werp ik ver van mij
7045840 als er sprake is van een aantal onjuistheden in dit verhaal wil vrom dan toelichten op welke
7045841 en wat die onjuistheden betreft dit is ons offici le commentaar en daar willen we het bij laten goedenmiddag
7045842 o that my throat had been cut across my tongue torn out and my body buried in the rough sands of the sea at low water mark where the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty four hours ere i had been accessory to the death of so good a man as our grand master hiram abiff
7045843 o that my left breast had been torn open and my heart and vitals taken from thence and thrown over my left shoulder carried into the valley of jehosaphat and there to become a prey to the wild beasts of the field and vultures of the air ere i had conspired the death of so good a man as our grand master hiram abiff
7045844 o that my body had been severed in two in the midst and divided to the north and south my bowels burnt to ashes in the center and the ashes scattered by the four winds of heaven that there might not the least track or remembrance remain among men or masons of so vile and perjured a wretch as i am ah jubela and jubelo it was i that struck him harder than you both
7045845 you must conceal all crimes of your brother masons and should you be summoned as a witness against a brother mason be always sure to shield him it may be perjury to do this it is true but youre keeping your obligations
7045846 een laffe daad waarbij het extra treurig was dat de moord door een moslim in de naam van de islam is gepleegd
7045847 oorlog tegen diegenen die de haram de religieuze verboden van allah vermijden
7045848 ranken te sluiten en een granietsterk monolithisch blok te vormen dat onze stem unisono laat resoneren tegen de tegen onze groep gerichte niet aflatende haatpropaganda
7045849 om de nadruk te leggen op de positieve bijdrage van de arabische cultuur aan de ontwikkeling van europa
7045850 de grote verrijking die het arabisch cultuurgoed ons te bieden heeft vooral op het gebied van normen en waarden
7045851 the form is different but the content is the same that is why i propose a referendum in all eu
7045852 de kamervoorzitter komt er bij mij niet in dat heb ik haar ook laten weten aldus wilders
7045853 ranken te sluiten en een granietsterk monolithisch blok te vormen dat onze stem unisono laat resoneren tegen de tegen onze groep gerichte niet aflatende haatpropaganda
7045854 with a gesture of his hand that went up and down again
7045855 should the us undertake military action against iran to stop their nuclear programme
7045856 essentially if you get a heavy metal stuck on dna you can get a mutation
7045857 the health effects of uranium really havent been studied since the manhattan project the development of the atomic bomb in the early 1940s but now there is more interest in the health effects of depleted uranium people are asking questions now
7045858 when the uranium mining boom crashed in the 80s there wasnt much cleanup
7045859 yet the technology exists to create a totalitarian new world order
7045860 covert neurological communication systems are in place to counteract independent thinking and to control social and political activity on behalf of self serving private and military interests
7045861 when our brain functions are already connected to supercomputers by means of radio implants and microchips it will be too late for protest this threat can be defeated only by educating the public using available literature on biotelemetry and information exchanged at international congresses
7045862 one reason this technology has remained a state secret is the widespread prestige of the psychiatric diagnostic statistical manual iv produced by the u s american psychiatric association apa printed in 18 languages
7045863 implanted human beings can be followed anywhere their brain functions can be remotely monitored by supercomputers and even altered through the changing of frequencies
7045864 guinea pigs in secret experiments have included prisoners soldiers mental patients handicapped children deaf and blind people homosexuals single women the elderly school children and any group of people considered
7045865 todays microchips operate by means of low frequency radio waves that target them
7045866 when a 5 micromillimeter microchip the diameter of a strand of hair is 50 micromillimeters is placed into optical nerve of the eye it draws neuro impulses from the brain that embody the experiences smells sights and voice of the implanted person
7045867 every thought reaction hearing and visual observation causes a certain neurological potential spikes and patterns in the brain and its electromagnetic fields which can now be decoded into thoughts pictures and voices electromagnetic stimulation can therefore change a persons brainwaves and affect muscular activity causing painful muscular cramps experienced as torture
7045868 de mening dat nicolaas een opvolger van wodan is heeft sindsdien definitief afgedaan
7045869 journalisten vergeten maar al te graag dat ze deel uitmaken van een bureaucratische onderneming en dat ze aan de regels daarvan gebonden zijn ze zijn onafhankelijk en vrij in het rapporteren van het nieuws zolang ze binnen de door hun superieuren gestelde grenzen blijven
7045870 zij weten immers wat eind en hoofdredacteuren graag geschreven zien en schrijven daar ook naar na verloop van tijd wordt dit gedrag een tweede natuur
7045871 there are always going to be a few people who cant be brainwashed
7045872 but for the most part the masses remain in the dark not having a clue how the new world order plan works and how they really are
7045873 everybody has to realize that this is their system not ours people have to realize they are led to believe they are free but really they are not mind control is a big part of the new world order takeover and they use religion as one of their main tools
7045874 people have to remember that this elitist system has been passed down for hundreds if not thousands of years they work through secret societies infiltrating governments and religions and using freemasonry around the world as their tool
7045875 the people at the lower levels of course dont understand whats happening at the top and they provide a good cover for the top levels to carry out their plan of one government and one religion through war and genocide we are put on this planet for a short time and must try to first understand what is happening by understanding history
7045876 weve got to eliminate the crocodiles because apparently theyre running all over the place
7045877 ive been deluged with new agers whove swallowed every piece of candy on the bookshelves and their solution is to stare down holes like mt
7045878 the oneness movement was put out there by the top of the establishment for the establishments sake
7045879 why would anyone give power of law over one self to someone or hundreds whove sworn allegiance to a secret agenda just like with the ftaa nafta gatt soa the public know by the effects years after the deals have been signed into law we are only now seeing the effects of the next stage america is asleep no one can argue they didnt notice the unification of europe and the subjugation of once national governments to that of minor provinces where were the people of america while all that was going on and check the most popular books of that era yes counter intelligence works very well
7045880 we are truly into the age of chaos long in the planning and written about openly by the big movers and shakers who lord over us
7045881 after the unification of europe was to follow the unification of the americas with the resulting clash of cultures and the initial mayhem produced
7045882 among the most evil and unpleasant this court has ever come into contact with
7045883 the full extent of the psychological damage you have inflicted on this young girl wont be known for many years
7045884 you have completely ruined any immediate chance she may have had of leading a full life she must have believed sexual promiscuity was the norm
7045885 you carried on despite being investigated by police and even had the affront to write to the chief con stable claiming that officers were harassing you
7045886 not only do you not have any empathy for the victim but you lacked any insight into the seriousness or consequences of your behaviour
7045887 we can see from his previous convictions when he stabbed someone seven times and tried electrocuting them that he is a very controlling individual
7045888 mr lawlor accepts full responsibility for it but it is also a case of him burying his head in the sand and failing to face up to what he has done
7045889 it is clear you have very little if any consideration of how your behaviour has harmed the victim
7045890 he recognised one of them as a fellow member of his masonic lodge who walked up to him and asked do you want to have a bit of fun he pointed out a girl who was with them
7045891 he is distraught about the shame and suffering he has brought upon his wife and daughter
7045892 he is utterly concerned about the welfare of the young lady and we have prayed together for her future well being and for forgiveness
7045893 we are satisfied in that we have identified a large number of men involved in sexual activity with this girl
7045894 there cant be any more victims they can get to while they are locked up like this
7045895 the judge has been fair and we are particularly pleased with fred lawlors sentence
7045896 we can see from his previous convictions when he stabbed someone seven times and tried electrocuting them that he is a very controlling individual
7045897 he has used a girl from the age of 13 to have sex with a large number of men
7045898 he hasnt been satisfied with that he had to take it to a public place in broad daylight
7045899 but he wasnt satisfied with that and went even further by filming it
7045900 he has the classic signs of a paedophile he refuses to comprehend his actions and has tried to worm his way out of it from day one by putting the blame on others including the victim when he instigated everything
7045901 child abuse is a disgusting crime picking on vulnerable people looking to an adult for support and guidance
7045902 this would not have been possible without the observations carried out by police officers on the ground who visited the beaches
7045903 it became a much larger inquiry than anybody had initially perhaps expected
7045904 if it wasnt for that work very many people who were sent to prison would not have been
7045905 we are very satisfied with the way the appeal went and with the quick response there has been
7045906 a member of staff was suspended in february pending the out come of a police investigation into allegations made against him
7045907 we are aware police have now brought charges against a member of staff and we will await the outcome of a trial
7045908 a 45 year old man from chester has been charged with three offences of sexual assault and has been bailed to appear before wrexham magistrates
7045909 fervent masonic desire to rebuild solomons temple is the driving force behind events in israel once completed prophecy will be fulfilled
7045910 masons making a move in israel and a closer look at the road map
7045911 this picture was taken by a friend while in eilat recently it is on the road that crosses the border and one of the first things a visitor sees when coming from egypt into israel i have written about the involvement of freemasonry in the israeli government mainly through the supreme court and the knesset but this makes a clear statement to anyone crossing the border into israel that the illuminati or freemasons are in control here
7045912 one of dees biographers described him as elizabethan englands great magus dee was a practitioner of hermetic gnosticism a school of thought based on the ancient pre christian teachings of the greek god hermes hermes was in fact a mere copy of the much earlier egyptian god of knowledge and language thoth in this sense all hermetic gnosticism can be viewed as a worship of the teachings of thoth according to the egyptian mythos thoth was one of the gods who came down to earth along with isis and osiris to bring the fruits of knowledge civilization and the sciences to the egyptian people in 1581 using his knowledge of these ancient practices he began a series of attempts to communicate with higher beings his channel in this capacity was one sir edward kelly
7045913 conjuration of the spirits of the dead for purposes of magically revealing the future or influencing the course of events
7045914 the focus of their efforts was to obtain the knowledge of the book of enoch a supposed
7045915 enoch is the central figure around which a great deal of masonic legend is centered as he is said to have constructed the two pillars of masonic lore to preserve the antediluvian high knowledge of atlantis inside them
7045916 ik maak uit alles op dat de man geoefend moet zijn
7045917 hij was daar met een geladen pistool en had kennelijk een vooropgezet doel na zijn arrestatie wenste hij geen verklaring af te leggen en vroeg hij meteen naar een advocaat dat wijst op een heel koel persoon
7045918 als mij straks wat gebeurt dan zijn zij de nederlandse regering mede verantwoordelijk
7045919 grote krokodillentranen de mensen in het land zien wel wat voor dubbele bodem daar achter zit aldus langendam gisteren in het parool
7045920 in de marge van hun onderzoek zullen ze ook proberen een aantal complottheorie n uit te sluiten
7045921 het is allemaal voorbestemd lang geleden al voor je uitgestippeld het heeft dus geen zin je ertegen te verzetten
7045922 pims moeder heette jacoba en dat is ook de naam van mijn vrouw
7045923 het is niet mijn merk maar zon gepantserd model ziet er toch goed uit
7045924 twee keer per jaar even oefenen om je vaardigheid op peil te houden
7045925 dat er waarheid schuilt in het gezegde doe wel en zie niet om
7045926 ik heb altijd de aantrekkingskracht gevoeld van de onderstroom vrijmetselarij was in vroegere eeuwen zon onderstroom tegen het absolutisme maar het is ook de eerste beweging die echt democratisch functioneerde niet de prins of de baron wordt voorzitter maar de beste van het gezelschap
7045927 hij is de gewone man die de top bereikt heeft en daar rustig onder blijft
7045928 zul je voortaan h l voorzichtig zijn op straat ik houd nu rekening met aanslagen
7045929 het gebruik maken van een rood petje als je een moord gaat plegen om je daarna ongemerkt uit de benen te willen maken is paradoxaal de verdachte heeft halverwege de vluchtroute van positie gewisseld met de echte dader de opdrachtgevers wisten dingen van hem en hebben dit gebruikt om hem onder druk te zetten
7045930 maar de aanwijzingen werden steeds sterker er kwamen dingen naar buiten die niemand kon weten alleen wij
7045931 zoiets zou bij niemand zijn opgekomen aldus de oud minister van binnenlandse zaken
7045932 rein jan hoekstra was immers de man die ten tijde van de bijlmerramp secretaris generaal was op het ministerie van algemene zaken en in die functie ook co rdinator van alle nederlandse veiligheids en geheime diensten als er dus iemand was die boter op zijn hoofd had als het mogelijke geheime wapen en andere transporten via schiphol naar isra l betrof dan was het rein jan hoekstra maar voor de regering was hij natuurlijk een uitgelezen man om zon onderzoekscommissie voor te zitten hij zou kunnen ingrijpen als de commissie te dicht in de buurt kwam van zaken die vanwege de betrekkingen met isra l geheim moesten blijven de tweede kamer was te na ef om deze connectie te zien
7045933 maar u zult mij geloven als ik het vertel de bvd luisterde niet alleen fortuyn af maar al veel langer die milieugroep van volkert van der g dat is gebruikelijk bij dat soort radikale groeperingen
7045934 al direct na 6 mei 2002 wist ik dat ik dit ging doen het is niet gek dat theo van gogh ogenblikkelijk dezelfde mening was toegedaan per slot heeft mijn vader de zijne nog aangenomen bij de bvd
7045935 in het rapport over fortuyns beveiliging kwam al de opname van een telefoongesprek tussen twee milieu activisten uit harderwijk en wageningen ter sprake
7045936 ja voor de joint strike fighter dat je dat niet begrijpt
7045937 ja en daarom wilde sobel vorig jaar met pim praten over de jsf pim heeft me dat zelf verteld albert de booij was ook bij dat gesprek aanwezig omdat pims engels zo slecht was hij heeft mij verteld dat de ambassadeur zich schor heeft geluld om pim over te halen die vliegtuigen te aanvaarden
7045938 volgens de booij had de ambassadeur pim al een heel eind omgeturnd pim zei tegen mij iets heel anders maar goed die is er niet meer waar het om gaat is dat sobel in een interview met nrc handelsblad ontkent dat hij met pim over dat vliegtuig heeft gesproken toen ik dat las dacht ik de vent liegt de vraag is waarom liegt de amerikaanse ambassadeur
7045939 om daarachter te komen heb ik een fax gestuurd naar meneer sobel waarom liegt u why do you lie
7045940 nadat ik die fax had gestuurd werd ik gebeld door een man uit huizen die noemde zijn naam en telefoonnummer u kunt bij de politie navragen wie ik ben want ik ben zeer bekend ik wil u wel waarschuwen dat als u doorgaat de amerikaanse ambassadeur te bestoken met faxen nou ik had n fax gestuurd en u zou naar amerika gaan dan komt u in een psychiatrische kliniek letterlijk zei hij dat en als u hier blijft dan zou ik maar uitkijken want dan krijgt u een kogel nou daar ben ik wel van geschrokken het is de eerste keer dat ik die beurt krijg h
7045941 ik sla alarm pim zei ook ze gaan me vermoorden en ze hebben het gedaan
7045942 ik heb geen flauw idee maar ik denk dat sobel de aandacht van fortuyn wilde afleiden je weet wie pim hebben opgeruimd dat hebben de hollandse boertjes niet gedaan
7045943 ja wat dacht u wij schieten toch geen mensen dood in dit land het was voor de amerikanen toch van het allergrootste belang die tien miljard binnen te halen
7045944 dat denk ik ja dat vinden ze natuurlijk ontz ttend vervelend dat ik dat denk
7045945 vandaag komt mijn advocaat terug dan ga ik stennis trappen
7045946 het gesprek met fortuyn verliep heel plezierig en duurde langer dan de bedoeling was maar de jsf is geen keer ter sprake gekomen
7045947 hij is er niet in geslaagd mensen tot de jsf over te halen die daarvan voordien nog niet waren overtuigd
7045948 we are not asking vohra to resign he should resign himself as his approach to the amarnath shrine board land transfer issue is not clear
7045949 some state governments have offered land to the tatas to shift their small car plant from singur but i would like to assert that the project will be a reality
7045950 i hope it will be implemented in time and the first car will roll out in october nobody can obstruct it
7045951 we organised the demonstration in support of the demands made by our supremo mamata banerjee the west bengal government must return 400 acres of land to the helpless farmers
7045952 we will be including a compulsory content storage clause in the iptv guidelines whereby service providers will be required to retain all televised content over a period of 90 days and enable viewing of the programmes on consumers demand
7045953 let him chiranjeevi come he has conducted one public meeting no name no work
7045954 nothing is going to happen by two or three leaders leaving the party
7045955 attestations on the part of us officials which allude to india having to accept a new draft hinting at conditionalities cannot be considered acceptable
7045956 clearly reserves the right to walk out if extraneous conditions are imposed if so the failure would not be on the part of india
7045957 the objections rooted in the selective application of so called non proliferation concerns may at best be relevant to non weapons countries without over half a century of indigenous r and d and a technologically advanced programme
7045958 if indeed such concerns were serious an objective assessment of the rampant proliferation over the last decade is called for where many of these very countries have remained mute witnesses to well known instances of illegal activity and violations of international undertakings
7045959 at this moment i can say that our talks with the governor appointed panel have been absolutely fruitful and productive
7045960 this also depends on our and their viewpoints we are hopeful of the talks progressing towards that end
7045961 open house today for a mountain modern on mount vernon
7045962 sayan peru limpieza total en la villa de irrigacion santa rosa archivo 2 2
7045963 stylish at any speed the mid century automotive design show
7045964 we pay eight grand to fly business class from new york and b a will pour me as much 50 a bottle champagne as i can drink but if i want to use the internet i gotta pay 30
7045965 you cant nickel and dime high yield customers like that
7045966 the obvious application for this spectrum is for internet connectivity everywhere all the time
7045967 remember that fuzzy static between channels on the old tvs
7045968 today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused
7045969 so we took it upon ourselves to take advantage of that and go get it ourselves
7045970 white space opens that up it drops the cost of end user equipment it increases the ability of us to broadcast to not have intermediate repeating towers to support going through a grove of trees
7045971 because expanded access to the internet hopefully means more users using google and more users using google means more people hopefully clicking on the ads
7045972 but we do think that once americans learn more about the issue theyll agree with us
7045973 when it gets a little boring i might pull it out
7045974 we think this is the way the future is going to work
7045975 we would have probably gone ahead of this maybe just getting a thousand iphones and giving them out
7045976 these actions would ensure that low power auxiliary operations do not cause harmful interference to new public safety and commercial wireless services in the band
7045977 these are the favored frequencies because they can be run at lower power and can be used for very high quality audio
7045978 a lot of us certainly are suffering from fay fatigue but weve got to stay focused
7045979 i dont think any foreign internet company can effectively compete against chinese companies in the chinese market
7045980 the regulatory environment is so difficult that its almost impossible for foreigners to have an advantage over locals who have better political connections and who can manipulate the regulatory system much more effectively
7045981 everything much of the user interface is not as complete or polished as planned in designs
7045982 the feedback were getting here in the market has been positive
7045983 legislation would make it clear to not only network carriers but also the public that network neutrality is enshrined in law that the fcc has jurisdiction and that it is not going to be subject to years of litigation
7045984 while these changes will increase listings impact to the demand side of the equation remains to be seen
7045985 given that ebay made no change to financial guidance as a result of the lower insertion fees the increase to final value charges are clearly significant
7045986 our goal with our pricing change is to be the most competitive marketplace on the web period
7045987 in fact i saved the addresses and banking information of 1 5 million clients
7045988 it is necessary to have a general ban for the trade in personal information such as name address date of birth or profession this should only be passed on for commercial purposes if a consumer has expressly given his or her permission
7045989 we certainly hope that this will be resolved before the dtv transition on feb 17 and hope the fcc adopts our road map on how to move forward which protects members of the public allows for opening the spectrum for all productive wireless devices and punishes only those who illegally marketed the devices in the first place
7045990 appear to make it more difficult to place unlicensed devices on channels 21 51 since the demand for wireless mike spectrum will increase on those channels
7045991 shure plans to work closely with the fcc during this rulemaking process
7045992 in anticipation of changes in the 700 mhz band shure ceased manufacture marketing and sale of all wireless microphone products in this frequency range the last of which was discontinued in 2007
7045993 we are examining the order and will evaluate our next step
7045994 we are in a trial and final results of that are yet unknown which is why we do trials
7045995 the important point is that the intent of network management has and continues to be to provide a great experience for our customers
7045996 inconsistent with the concept of an open and accessible internet
7045997 another important step to ensure that all consumers have unfettered access to the internet
7045998 the framework we adopt today will send a message to the industry that bad actors will be punished
7045999 with this order the internet remains in the hands of consumers and the greatest engine of free speech and commerce since the printing press
7046000 specifically recognized the commissions ancillary authority to impose regulations as necessary to protect broadband internet access
7046001 we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
7046002 we also believe the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
7046003 we are considering all of our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
7046004 masn signed an agreement almost two years ago to be carried on comcast systems
7046005 and now masn has simply decided that it no longer likes the deal it made comcast has fulfilled its part of the bargain and intends to hold masn to the deal it struck the complaint filed by masn is completely without merit
7046006 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7046007 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the and at the same time all records of this athlete at the will immediately be erased
7046008 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7046009 i obviously had scored i dont know if they werent watching or what
7046010 thats one of the things i hate about this sport
7046011 jag hann aldrig ifatt efter min skada tidigare i sommar
7046012 we just watched felipes qualifying lap and as he said it was sector one in which he destroyed everyone
7046013 they are going to be hard to beat tomorrow but we will push as hard as possible to do so
7046014 we noticed we had a good car through practice and then going into q1 and q2 it was about getting through and it wasnt too much of a problem the car felt great
7046015 i stayed on the option tyre for both of my q3 laps and the first one wasnt a great lap i probably lost a second compared to my later timed lap
7046016 but i think the last lap was pretty good i was quite happy with that
7046017 there is always a little bit of time you lose somewhere but generally i was very happy and it is a good starting position for us tomorrow
7046018 i think i was already down a tenth or two tenths after the first corner
7046019 it was okay through turn two and three and then four and five it didnt seem to be as strong as i liked so that is probably where the time went
7046020 we always want to be on the top and starting on pole here for the first time is very nice
7046021 the track here is not very easy especially the surface which is very slippery so to make the perfect lap is very difficult
7046022 i had a good lap so it was good to score the pole position
7046023 i think we have a good car for the race tomorrow it will be very difficult but lets try to do our best
7046024 i think i made the pole position in the first sector that was just fantastic
7046025 then i made some very small mistakes in sector two as you always have a car that oversteers or understeers it depends on the corner you do through then i had a good sector three
7046026 for sure we have a great car we have shown it in so many races this year and in the last race but unfortunately these things engine failure can happen
7046027 somehow or another it caused the 911 system to crash
7046028 the lesson here if you want to own the story probably best to jump on the send button once the msm surrounds your super secret vp choices house with camera crews
7046029 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
7046030 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
7046031 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
7046032 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
7046033 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
7046034 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
7046035 preparing for the worst what communities need to know in the event of a community tragedy
7046036 i think the majority of individuals are in the process of recovery
7046037 people are relying on their own resiliency to help them move forward
7046038 miller caught a few passes from the then ball boy at greenwood during warm ups on the sidelines
7046039 i think that there are a lot of great guys up here i think there are six of us in the quarterback room and i knew the reps were probably going to be a little bit limited i just tried to make the most of my opportunity and i think thats come and with a great attitude its going to be the opportunity to take more snaps
7046040 i like it when quarterbacks show a little favoritism hes definitely getting in there and learning the offense and proving himself worthy
7046041 theres four or five receivers on the field at all times there are plenty of guys that can make plays so i get it to the guy thats open
7046042 in the early spring i got the playbook and thumbing through it
7046043 you really dont start understanding the offense until you get up here and start being a part of things i think its finally starting to click a little bit and i still have a lot to learn
7046044 he has good instincts he may not go to the one receiver for that played called but if you notice his instincts are really good for a young quarterback i think hes going to be great leader on down the road
7046045 you become a little more excited when you see things pan out
7046046 we didnt run the ball a whole lot in high school but when we did we did a lot of screens and draws
7046047 its a lot similar to this offense but obviously its a lot more complex now
7046048 there are a lot of plays you have to learn but once you start to understand it its a language and things speak for themselves i think there is going to be a lot of throwing the ball around mixed up with the running game there are checks for pretty much everything we do and i think thats whats going to make us successful
7046049 i actually made a comment to him that we should hang out when all of this is over
7046050 and he goes were going to be hanging out for the next three weeks
7046051 weve been together through this whole camp and i think thats what the camp is about building bonds and relationships with your brothers i think thats what makes you successful in the long run too
7046052 i just didnt have the extra gear the last 200 meters im happy i kept myself at the front i would have liked to have a little extra at the end to get in the top three
7046053 you try to go and its there or its not
7046054 its hard to explain i would have liked to be closer to a medal shot but it was a great experience its the best women in the world so i cant complain
7046055 i think i learned i should be in front i should keep myself in position
7046056 thats the best way to race theres so many positives that have come out of this its the olympics you think about medals to put it in perspective im young i have a lot of races to go i cant be disappointed
7046057 pop to go with those girls when they made the move i couldnt go with it
7046058 reducing poverty by increasing literacy and funds and supports literacy initiatives locally nationally and around the world
7046059 oh come to me this thing i do not want
7046060 we cant arrange long term care here so we try to do the best we can in the country of origin
7046061 its important to make sure that hospitals arent permitted to dump patients on an international level when they cant do it on a local level
7046062 hospitals dont have the financial resources to meet all of the acute care needs of patients without insurance let alone take on all the chronic care needs that present with patients like this
7046063 first blossom of sanctity that south america gave to the world
7046064 since the discovery of peru no missionary has arisen who effected a similar popular zeal for the practice of penance
7046065 on which the paradise of her heavenly bridegroom unlocked itself to her
7046066 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7046067 not to worry i am the only artist in the show
7046068 een tijd niks geschreven maar nooit uit mijn gedachte gegaan
7046069 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7046070 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7046071 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7046072 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7046073 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7046074 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7046075 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7046076 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7046077 of two time olympian talks about sex in the olympic village
7046078 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7046079 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7046080 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7046081 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7046082 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7046083 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7046084 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7046085 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7046086 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7046087 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7046088 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7046089 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7046090 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7046091 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7046092 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7046093 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7046094 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7046095 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7046096 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7046097 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7046098 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7046099 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7046100 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7046101 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7046102 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7046103 looking at all options and hope to meet with the company in the very near future to discuss our thoughts
7046104 gabelli was instrumental in persuading folks it was an undervalued private bid
7046105 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage

7046107 arent you worried about getting facial hair dont you think you should get a second opinion what if your voice deepens

7046109 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7046110 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
7046111 i am confident of winning because many voters are fed up with both barisan nasional and pakatan rakyats hostile politics and mud slinging

7046116 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7046117 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7046118 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7046119 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7046120 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7046121 babylegs protect crawling babies knees and keep little legs warm especially the often exposed skin between the sock and the bottom of the pant or skirt
7046122 through the divine light in me i call forth and am grateful for the sacred union of the divine masculine and the divine feminine within in oneness with creation we sow the seeds of peace
7046123 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7046124 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7046125 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7046126 i think itd be a stupid mistake to lower the drinking age the simple fact is it will kill more people on our highways
7046127 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7046128 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7046129 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7046130 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7046131 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7046132 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7046133 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7046134 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7046135 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7046136 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7046137 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7046138 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7046139 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7046140 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7046141 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7046142 i know that human rights were violated during the conflict
7046143 i am only here to look at the human rights situation and come up with recommendations on how these rights can be protected in the future our report will be objective and impartial
7046144 many people had their rights violated including the primary right to life to housing and so on and this issue requires much attention so weve come to find out what happened from that perspective
7046145 by september 1 the schools will definitely be open the first school has already been fixed and is ready two more schools will be ready on time as well
7046146 they bombed our homes luckily i had some buckets of water so i put out the fire the neighbours were gone and their houses burnt down they bombed several times see i have no ceiling now saakashvili is scary he is worse than hitler they say he is really insane i cannot understand why the georgian people obey him
7046147 eu n o acho que foi t o grave assim tudo uma quest o de perspectiva

7046153 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7046154 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7046155 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7046156 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7046157 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7046158 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7046203 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7046204 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7046205 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7046206 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7046207 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

7046242 who the hell made that i think its so cool
7046243 i wont let a girl come in half way and ruin my chances
7046244 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7046245 a clean black man the first black guy on the american political scene who can both shower regularly and speak properly is that really what biden thinks if a republican had said this wed have a national outpouring of grief over the residual ignorance and racial insensitivity in our country and the guy would be in sensitivity training until around about the time john kerry is elected president
7046246 if biden thinks that obama is clean then he has to think that others are not clean does he mean that he knows that jesse jackson is not clean does he mean that he knows that reverend sharpton is not clean see folks this is the problem for the libs once they get off script they expose their idiocy they expose their prejudice
7046247 when i heard his comments i thought joe biden was referring to a bygone era
7046248 years ago when white folks referred to black people with education they often used words like articulate to suggest they were different they were acceptable that they were ok as compared to rest of african americans so i think it came across that joe biden was referring to sen obama as if he was a candidate running in the 1960s not in the 21st century
7046249 and thats why he should interpret what he meant by those loaded words it was an attempt i thought to diminish baracks attributes and dismissive of our previous campaigns that made baracks candidacy possible
7046250 you can just look around the city and see that its being rebuilt but its being rebuilt by us the citizens

7046253 ill analyze whether or not i have the jurisdiction to call a public hearing and if so whether its in the public interest
7046254 and then i will try to address in a general way what the fuss was all about because i think im kind of the only source left
7046255 i have my job to do and i will do it regardless of who has done their job or who hasnt done their job or who has leaked information
7046256 i will be doing what i can as much as i can because i understand the publics desire for information

7046271 essential oils are not herbs and i wouldnt consider them inherenly poison free
7046272 herbalism really means developing a relationship with these plants and that relationship involves a lot more than just them healing what ails you you have to recognize what they do use them properly not abuse them and above all respect them and what they can do if you fail to do that herbs prepared in any fashion can cause a lot of damage
7046273 that said you certainly dont need an industrial infrastructure to produce essential oils it really just comes down to a long term infusion made in oil instead of water plenty of wild cultures used essential oils and i see no reason why rewilded people wouldnt do the same
7046274 kate we obviously have very different meanings weve worked from
7046275 i dont know if we really want to adopt your terminology
7046276 ive got plenty of books that tell me that i can make essential oil by infusing it in oil for several days
7046277 measure 2 teaspoons of each essential oil into 4oz bottle citronella cedar eucalyptus and wintergreen add olive oil to fill bottle it should add up to approximately 2 ounces of olive oil shake and label
7046278 i dont know if we really want to adopt your terminology

7046292 we start overvaluing our waking time and come to see our sleeping time only as a way to support our waking time
7046293 we should lie down and go out right away so we can get up and get to the day right away
7046294 theres a lot to be done while your head is still young
7046295 shouldnt spend time reading or whatever because that meant i was training myself to stick with this
7046296 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
7046297 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7046298 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7046299 americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken washington arent going to find them on the obama biden ticket in joe biden barack obama has not only found a running mate who doesnt believe hes ready to be president hes proven his opposition to an all of the above energy reform strategy to lower fuel costs for families and small businesses
7046300 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7046301 with a lifetime lcv environmental score of 83 joe biden recognizes that ending our addiction to oil is vital to our national security senator biden is a long time leader on key energy and environmental issues and the members of lcv enthusiastically support senator obamas choice
7046302 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7046303 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7046304 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7046305 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7046306 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7046307 dead on the life and cinema of george a romero
7046308 es el momento por el cual he estado luchando mucho al que he dedicado mucho tiempo yo creo que s es el triunfo m s importante de mi vida
7046309 mi carrera apenas inicia y espero seguir cosechando m s preseas para m xico
7046310 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7046311 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7046312 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7046313 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7046314 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7046315 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7046316 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7046317 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7046318 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7046319 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7046320 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7046321 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7046322 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7046323 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7046324 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7046325 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7046326 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7046327 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7046328 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7046329 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7046330 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7046331 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7046332 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7046333 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7046334 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7046335 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7046336 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7046337 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7046338 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7046339 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7046340 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7046341 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7046342 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7046343 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7046344 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7046345 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7046346 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7046347 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7046348 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7046349 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7046350 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7046351 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7046352 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7046353 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7046354 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

7046366 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7046367 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7046368 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7046369 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7046370 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7046371 it is extremely rare for two incidents of this nature to occur just over a mile apart in an area such as workington and we are devoting significant resources to catching those responsible
7046372 we are reminding women to be mindful of their personal safety when out in the town
7046373 there are similarities between the mossbay road attack and the hunter street incident so a joint investigation is under way to ensure every avenue is thoroughly explored
7046374 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7046375 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7046376 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7046377 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7046378 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7046379 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7046380 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7046381 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7046382 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7046383 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7046384 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7046385 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7046386 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7046387 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7046388 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7046389 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7046390 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7046391 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7046392 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7046393 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7046394 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7046395 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7046396 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7046397 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7046398 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7046399 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7046400 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7046401 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7046402 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7046403 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7046404 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7046405 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7046406 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7046407 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7046408 if i just do what i normally do i should make the final that should be no problem
7046409 hanya orang orang yang berkepentingan saja yang bisa hadir di sini
7046410 at this stage there is no indication to suggest that knives or weapons were involved but we believe this group came to the tower block for a specific purpose
7046411 for reasons which we continue to investigate this caused ahmed and his friends to leave the flats
7046412 ahmed was separated from his friends and climbed on to the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on and he lost his grip
7046413 after this point he fell to his death there is no indication that ahmed was assaulted before he fell
7046414 having recovered cctv evidence it is apparent that after ahmed fell five of the six youths left the area they were seen riding on pedal cycles along paragon road away from mare street
7046415 one of the male youths left the area on foot leaving his bicycle at the scene police have recovered this and it is being forensically examined

7046429 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7046430 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7046431 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7046432 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
7046433 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7046434 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7046435 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7046436 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7046437 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birth date
7046438 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
7046439 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
7046440 if you trust every web site but not a government
7046441 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7046442 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7046443 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7046444 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
7046445 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
7046446 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
7046447 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
7046448 if i end up taking the penalty at the end im worried ill humiliate myself and fall over
7046449 you hit this ill hit that but eventually we tried to get something melodic that would go from a to b without falling apart thats the long story short
7046450 we deployed about 25 000 men to guard polling booths and the reports so far suggest that the voting went off without any major incident
7046451 we were a bit disappointed with the way we handled the situation there dambulla
7046452 we wanted to execute certain plans which we couldnt but that game has gone the wicket and conditions are different here and all the batsmen are ready for the challenge
7046453 it is a different wicket and looks firm the ball will probably come nicely on to the bat so definitely there will be more runs it is all about getting used to the conditions and the performance on the day
7046454 in one day cricket bowlers do come into the play create opportunities and put pressure but batsmen have more responsibility as they are the ones who control the game because runs on the board are vital
7046455 he has been bowling for the last two days and looking good right now he has a very good chance of playing the match on sunday
7046456 he and murali have been doing the job for us for a long time to get 400 wickets is a great achievement
7046457 both the young players virat kohli and badrinath played really well in the last match
7046458 it was good to see young players coming in and feeling comfortable in the international set up its very important for indian cricket that we have competition for places
7046459 we are discussing various combinations at the moment and would like to be pretty flexible we will take it game by game
7046460 the american presidential experience center offers the public an opportunity to experience first hand the inspiring power of the presidency

7046463 im watching all the cameras and traffic looks light to moderate
7046464 the economy has changed dramatically and people just arent eating out as much anymore
7046465 people are cutting back everywhere and a lot of companies including cafe dupri are feeling the effect
7046466 for the past two months business at the cafe has been down and if the business isnt making money i feel its a smart move to shut it down bottom line if it doesnt make money it doesnt make sense

7046510 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7046511 the main problem with this simplistic formula is that building democracies from scratch is a long and difficult process
7046512 led to a series of failures and to a new level of global fragmentation
7046513 the united states is a global power with global ambitions and interests from the u s point of view it has no interests that it is willing to sacrifice regions that moscow sees as secondary to u s interests have become necessary components of the us structure known as american leadership
7046514 the united states was not in a position to give substantive support to its ally georgia it was even unable to prevent georgia from making fatal mistakes
7046515 for their generous support in this our hour of need
7046516 without this support the burden would have been too heavy to bear

7046526 the revelation was written by the apostle john during the reign of the roman emperor domitian about the year a
7046527 as to the date of the composition some scholars particularly of the last century have been inclined to assign revelation either wholly or in part to the reign of nero and to the year a
7046528 it is far more probable that the revelation was written in a
7046529 then again modern historians agree that the neronian persecution hardly extended beyond the city of rome while the persecution under domitian was spread widely over the empire
7046530 furthermore the persecution under nero was not on the grounds of religious belief
7046531 nor did the means of punishment adopted by nero include banishment
7046532 for these and other reasons there is now rather general agreement upon the latter date for the composition of the revelation
7046533 to ascertain the exact time when john as a christian martyr on the isle of patmos received his visions is a matter of real oncern for both the inspiration and the correct interpretation of the apocalypse are involved however it is of still greater importance to note the character of the time in which the book was composed it was in days when the church was in great suffering and peril the allurements of the world or the fear of pain and loss were threatening to make men disloyal to their divine lord a godless state and a pagan religion were leagued together to destroy the cause of christ dangers even more dark and dread were on the horizon deliverance by no human power was possible it was in a time like this that john caught those inspiring visions of the returning triumphant king of his universal reign and of the celestial city established upon earth which have been the source of inspiration of comfort and of hope in all ages of the world

7046539 i honestly believe that im a better player now than i was in 1988 when i won the world championships
7046540 to play against these guys on a regular basis again has been really fantastic it has really woken me up and told me i can still do it but at the age of 60 im very happy to be in the league
7046541 i am definitely coming back next year i like the feel of that its been a number of years since i picked up a trophy but i liked the feeling and id like to do it again next year
7046542 im definitely confident of defending the title i think i laid down a pretty big ticket tonight saying what im capable of im a year older but the passion wont have diminished one jot
7046543 tonight was a totally different mindset it was kill or be killed right through the league youre thinking there is another match next week and that is a totally different mindset one we are not really used to
7046544 but im used to win or youre in the car park and that was my focus tonight and im happy to say i did just that
7046545 but i think we were the best two players throughout the tournament
7046546 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7046547 i have not selected him as i do not think he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7046548 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game
7046549 ive got you its okay kenzie its going to be okay

7046600 women expect you to figure them out but if you try to do this youll get nowhere women arent linear so you cant take them from one point to another what you ayame said
7046601 jullie komen dus net uit toronto hoe hebben jullie het daar gehad en in welk gedeelte verbleven jullie eigenlijk
7046602 het was s per we verbleven bij een couchsurfer in de wijk jane amp finch erg gezellig geweest we zijn
7046603 sorry hoor maar de wijk j ne amp f nch zeg je you gotta be kidding that part of toronto is sooooo dangerous ik ben daar nog n it geweest en zelfs de politie durft er niet meer te komen er worden bijna dagelijks moorden gepleegd echt schietpartijen en steekpartijen zijn aan de orde van de dag levensgevaarlijk is het daar ongelovelijk dat jullie daar drie dagen gezeten hebben
7046604 gisterenmiddag heeft op klaarlichte dag in de wijk jane amp finch ontario de zoveelste schietpartij plaatsgevonden deze week bij een drive by shooting zijn twee meisjes om het leven gekomen
7046605 jamiel was photographed in a most interesting pose entering his blonde girl friend from the rear her dress hanging from her head to the floor so her face could not be seen the others cheered as he thrust himself deep into her and her shrieks reverberated around the room
7046606 try as much as possible not to be raped but if it happened you got busted dont scream try to enjoy it
7046607 there are two category of things in the world good things and fantastic things take pussy for example its goooood but if you ask me about a pussy with two holes in it its fantastiiiic since there is no such thing created yet my cheap buy for it would be a back slash
7046608 can a man who has anal sex with with a woman be considered gay
7046609 if two consenting adults so decide to participate in any type of sexual activity as they wish then this sexual activity is okay and fine
7046610 it is obvious that people will do what they want
7046611 a guy who gives it up there is not a real man
7046612 can a man who has anal sex with with a woman be considered gay
7046613 if you take the backdoor of a woman then you are the equivalent of a homosexual
7046614 if you enter a woman from behind that is also unnatural just as homosexuality is unnatural
7046615 if you really think about it going in the backdoor doesnt make sense if you do it youre basically a homosexual
7046616 to just specify the anus is not a sexual organ and its actually used for defecation and thats the only purpose one can see for it the vagina is a much more natural hole as it produces a proper orgasm is sensitive breaks on the first time showing its there for something special and its where the lady can get pregnant this is the natural place for sex to happen
7046617 sex is the most intimate act you do in your whole life and so if someone values themselves they will not do it so cheaply and meaninglessly
7046618 if youre sleeping around why not spice it up anything goes right theres absolutely no difference anyways so why not just be a homosexual
7046619 perhaps its better to have meaningful relationships most of your perceptions have to do with your exposure to the media as well as social norms it also has to do with desire and materialism
7046620 to just specify the anus is not a sexual organ and its actually used for defecation and thats the only purpose one can see for it
7046621 i dont know why u just ignor me let me know if u know x
7046622 if youre wearing a condom youre actually doing latex molecules you pervert molecular bastard
7046623 nobody knows if you are an asshole because you are online

7046625 well continue writing as long dubais guys continue to be idiots
7046626 if love is a two way street why do i always seem to end up in the back passage
7046627 oh you are insert nationality here very beautiful no problem hahahahahaha carry on
7046628 and i have no desire to jump him or vice versa that being said this is the only one where this phenomenon of friendship post dating has happened and he is not emirati
7046629 choose 100 married locals at random and hit on them 99 will not require too much coaxing this is a tried and true fact
7046630 a worthy woman is far more precious than jewels strength and dignity are her clothing
7046631 why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free
7046632 was not in love with his wife you know how it is you get married because of your family
7046633 cheaters do not deserve an ounce of anyones time or energy period
7046634 but is funny they dont learn and keep acting like clowns you included so relax loose a bit loser
7046635 loser how exactly do you see our behaviour as acting like clowns
7046636 how do you know someone is rubbish before even going out with them
7046637 dubais men are more signifcant in terms of quantity than quality
7046638 yeah i want a gorgeous babe who is much too attractive to be an appropriate match for me but i think i rate her anyway because im rich if shes a nice girl the money will attract her but then shell fall head over heels in love with me
7046639 im not going to bother about you anymore i just wanted to point out you arent a typical guy or a typical westerner either with your attitudes about
7046640 really dont stop what youre doing but dont put it in
7046641 i want to ooohhh please dont stop but dont put it in
7046642 im a virgin im saving myself dont stop but dont put it in
7046643 give me your car and ill let you do it in my pooper
7046644 hlh theres three men to every woman in dubai you do the math
7046645 err u do mean that its always better to give than to receive for the givers who gave give the gifts right
7046646 do mens selfish desires override the impact of a potentially great sex session
7046647 go girls go if guys can why cant we down with the double standards
7046648 perhaps you shouldve waited some more before you served it to him
7046649 what a load of rubbish aicha well in case you didnt know sex is not only about reproduction its also about pleasure and women physiologically get pleasure from sex too you seem to be absolutely unaware of that pool girl
7046650 even if the sperm donation is the last thing we want from sex
7046651 enough reason not to give it to the first good looking man on the g u l f c o u r t or first apologizing chef that had put f o r b i d e n t o m a t o s in your dish
7046652 as per grammar and spelling if i were you i wouldnt even bring that up
7046653 hehe and i didnt even go to any of the
7046654 i dont get it aicha you say youve been having so much sex and seen so many dicks in your life good for you you seem to be very proud of that
7046655 and then you blame some women who behave as if they had the balls
7046656 here we find two ladies who love to have sex just like men they face problems and disappointment in their quest and instead of being bitter like you they choose to make us all laugh about it we are here for fun dont spoil the party
7046657 next time dont take your panties off on a first date
7046658 i dont understand why you feel the need to even come to this blog
7046659 were yet to meet a healthy human being who doesnt like to fuck
7046660 and you continue to draw your own conclusions based on flawed assumptions of our ethnicity and residency really aicha didnt your elite school teach you to base arguments on facts instead of assumptions tsk tsk

7046664 if people who are banned attempt to enter a match under our ticketing conditions they are then liable to be charged with criminal trespass
7046665 we have been working closely with our security advisers police departments venue management and the clubs to do everything possible to minimise unacceptable behaviour at games
7046666 while there were some regrettable incidents at last saturdays match between sydney and melbourne the incidents were dealt with very quickly on the night by police and security personnel largely because of the co operation and planning that went into the security aspects of the game
7046667 its going to be our priority this project and were very committed to getting it up and running
7046668 at the moment were working through whether the establishment of a new state league could conflict or complement the tasmanian devils in the vfl
7046669 theres certainly a lot of arguments to suggest that they conflict
7046670 our role is the same as afl victorias and that is we need to grow and develop and promote the game in all areas of tasmania
7046671 and thats why the establishment of a state league is very important to us
7046672 theyve been very good for us and i think weve been good for them over the time theyve been in the competition so it would be disappointing for the league if we lost them
7046673 if we were to stay wed like to make a long term commitment to the vfl if were not in a position to do that then we dont believe that it would be fair to ourselves or anyone else to just make a year or two commitment
7046674 inti ta3bana are you okay lets go the movie is not so good
7046675 the women of todays world have come to this type of behavior
7046676 stop thinking of the consequences and lets enjoy each other at least one time when you are here ha im serious
7046677 it just doesnt matter who you are getting married to as long as youre getting married theres just something fundamentally wrong with that
7046678 noora will probably not give up her age because if she did i think you all will be shocked
7046679 if youre not from the countries im thinking of in my head dont bother
7046680 i think that everyone in russia and in the world is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
7046681 damascus is moscows long standing partner in military cooperation and we are expecting to reach an agreement in principle on new weapons deals
7046682 we had 30 teams in little league we were a powerhouse really there was nothing else but footy on saturdays kids didnt have distractions like basketball and playstations
7046683 you didnt dare miss a training session because you wouldnt get a game we had sunday morning training if you missed that you didnt get a game if you were in the seniors you couldnt drink after wednesday night if the coach found out you didnt get a game
7046684 they want to play where their schoolmates are there are 20 to 30 kids playing for other clubs in geelong whose fathers played for us
7046685 we lost 10 players from the seniors and on top of that five or six decided to retire
7046686 it had a massive impact a few of our seconds players also pulled the pin due to family and work we basically lost all our depth
7046687 once all that happened we drew a line in the sand we knew it was going to be a tough year
7046688 the ex afl players who come down this way command big dollars and we probably cant afford that at this stage
7046689 our areas a blue collar working area so we havent got too many deep pocket businessmen we dont have the doctors and lawyers and people who own their own businesses its unsustainable to go and buy a flag and leave the club in trouble
7046690 if you didnt have juniors youd be almost pulling up stumps maybe not pulling up stumps completely but it would be very very challenging
7046691 i honestly believe that im a better player now than i was in 1988 when i won the world championships
7046692 to play against these guys on a regular basis again has been really fantastic it has really woken me up and told me i can still do it but at the age of 60 im very happy to be in the league
7046693 i am definitely coming back next year i like the feel of that its been a number of years since i picked up a trophy but i liked the feeling and id like to do it again next year

7046708 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7046709 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7046710 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7046711 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7046712 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake

7046952 i have been playing pogo now for 2 years and have had a wonderful time meeting people from all over the world it is great fun and i am so glad that i found pogo
7046953 im a 24 year old graphic designer from northern vermont i design and lay out childrens books and put my heart and soul into making them fun and easy to understand for all levels of reading
7046954 i am a 24 year old i live in a small town in ohio i have been married to my wonderful husband for three years we have three beautiful children who are 7 5 2
7046955 im 47 year old who enjoys living everyday of my life to the fullest my family is the most important part of my life i love playing softball watching college and pro football and basketball
7046956 im a mural artist who has discovered the challenge of painting on canvas rather than walls its limited space but i love it what better place to crawl into your thoughts when you can create them in front of your own eyes
7046957 i am a stay at home mom who needs a break from the 17 month old that i call my son he is very active and keeps me very busy my husband and i recently relocated with his job
7046958 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
7046959 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
7046960 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
7046961 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
7046962 it is undeniable that the present investigation into alleged historical child abuse at haut de la garenne and elsewhere has cast a dark shadow over jersey and its people
7046963 however in spite of what some critics seem determined to assert neither the great majority of islanders nor our political and legal establishments can be damned by awful events which as far as we can tell unfolded decades ago and clearly involved a restricted number of people
7046964 it is possible that the haut de la garenne scandal could produce l asting effects that go beyond the scars that it will leave on the collective psyche of this island if senator stuart syvrets attempt to force the hand of british justice minister jack straw through a legal action calling for the intervention of english judges and prosecutors were to be successful a constitutional precedent would be established
7046965 this is not to say that the imposition of english judges would mark the immediate end of our status as a crown dependency in fact there are occasions when for reasons of its own the royal court calls in uk assistance in certain cases but
7046966 it is though highly unlikely that the senator is unaware of the possible far reaching consequences of his foray into the english courts and of its potential for spurring a catastrophic reordering of not only the legal but also the political social and economic life of the island
7046967 no critic nor survivor no campaigner no politician not even any national media have stated that the ordinary people of jersey are to be dammed for the awful events
7046968 only a fool or a liar could possible come to any conclusion other than that the jersey oligarchy has entirely been the author of its own misfortune in this matter
7046969 this government is fully committed to implement all agreements done with different political parties organisations and the preceding government
7046970 im very happy after being voted as the worlds sexiest woman as i had never expected this but im happier over the fact that its the first time that an indian is being presented on the international platform so im very happy

7046975 as que claramente es una especie en riesgo y la disminuci n de su talla podr a deberse a la captura accidental y la sobreexplotaci n pesquera
7046976 esta es una se al clara de que se est capturando por encima de la capacidad de reproducci n de este animal por eso deben establecerse planes concretos para su explotaci n

7046984 dear editor today i received yet another political mailing from our mp helena guergis with a mail in ballot to check which political leader i think is best its about the 10th similar mailing ive received this month with all the recent negative publicity on these household mailers i can only assume that ms guergis nor her staff in distant ottawa doesnt read the local media or maybe they do not understand that taxpayers are not happy with this waste of postage and partisan political comment when no election has been called i imagine that it costs around a dollar to print and mail these to each house and another dollar should the form be returned please will someone tell ms guergis and her ottawa office to spend our tax money on something constructive such as support for our olympic athletes dick hill collingwood

7046993 despite extensive local enquiries no one has been caught for this offence
7046994 astonished at the attack on what is a local club supporting local people
7046995 especially in the current economical climate many parents cannot afford a further increase in fees and rightly ask why should they pay for damage caused by a few thoughtless individuals
7046996 an initial estimate advises that it will cost 3 4 000 to complete the required repairs money the club just doesnt have

7046999 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7047001 to send love and acknowledgment to women who brighten your day teach you new things and live their lives fully with generosity and joy
7047002 i mean we played pretty well all tournament disappointed with the semi final against spain but today everything just came together for us
7047003 i wish wed played like that in the semi final but absolutely rapt with the way the boys played today and you couldnt ask for a better finish
7047004 i think it was just the one performance really in the semi final
7047005 in the end we were just beaten by a better team in that semi final but thats what you learn to live with and it will take a while to get over that performance but well just move on and get on with the next one
7047006 in the first half there were some defensive moments that were very sharp and some attacking sequences that were very good
7047007 the second half was the best thing for us at this point
7047008 its the first time we really saw some errors we need to work on
7047009 i think we can see a positive out of this
7047010 it was a dream game all i could think of was thank god the ball went over the line and now thanks to that i have a gold medal
7047011 we didnt play our best football today but this victory is a good one for us
7047012 the fact that we have been to the athletes village and met famous sportsmen its all an experience that we will not forget quickly
7047013 messi terrorises not only our team but all teams in europe he didnt score but he created a lot of their chances that is why we have the silver and they have the gold
7047014 were very disappointed but it means we came second in the olympic games we had a lot of good scoring chances but you have to score goals to win the gold medal
7047015 i agree this d bag pomoter sent a pic of hims
7047016 well jennifer i was going to get you a soft coated wheaton terrier this christmas but now that i know aquarians arent the most likely fit for dog ownership i think well just get a goldfish
7047017 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer
7047018 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
7047019 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
7047020 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
7047021 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers
7047022 speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music
7047023 not as far as im aware regarding what ea needs to do i cant comment on that ea takes piracy very seriously and people deserve to get paid for content they create
7047024 but as far as im aware we have no plans that i know of to partner with atari and codemasters and chase down consumers
7047025 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job

7047053 honoured to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7047054 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president can this person help me govern
7047055 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
7047056 bidens weaknesses are on the surface he has said a number of idiotic things over the years but that wont hurt all that much because voters are smart enough to forgive the genuine flaws of genuine people and over the long haul biden provides what obama needs
7047057 presidents need someone who will be relentlessly direct obama who attracts worshippers not just staff members needs that more than most
7047058 we were a bit disappointed the way we handled that situation in dambulla we knew it was going to be a tough period in that morning session weve wanted to execute certain things which we couldnt but that games gone its a different wicket tomorrow and we have to prepare ourselves for this challenge
7047059 to see young players like kohli and badrinath come in and do well is promising staking a claim for further honours they took a bit of responsibility too its good to see young players come in and feel comfortable in the international set up it is very important for indian cricket that we have competition for places
7047060 we do not want a player to become a selector as soon he retires we dont want them to be biased as they are the contemporaries of players who might still be in the team

7047096 whether joe biden is willing to go after john mccain
7047097 i dont think this will either antagonize or assuage her supporters
7047098 sen clinton likes joe biden and i dont think he said a bad word about her during the entire campaign theres no animosity or enmity at all in that sense hes a safe pick but shes the only person who was going to automatically bring her supporters back into the fold
7047099 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7047100 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7047101 hrc fans have been electrified by the late buzz on her dark horse potential
7047102 that is i havent heard anything to indicate that she is under serious consideration but that hasnt tamped down the hope
7047103 i believe the overwhelming polling data that senator clinton would have helped senator obama the most to win the election especially in battleground states
7047104 having said that i completely support the decision he has made as his alone and will support joe biden
7047105 joes smart and funny but this is not exactly an exciting choice
7047106 i know politics things just dont happen that way hillary knew that anyone who thought he would put her on the ticket is just clueless
7047107 its a big mistake not to choose her its sad and its a sure way to guarantee the republicans will win
7047108 and i beheld after they had dwindled in unbelief they became a dark and loathsome and a filthy people full of idleness and all manner of abominations
7047109 and i beheld that they were white and exceedingly fair and beautiful
7047110 and he had caused the cursing to come upon them yea even a sore cursing because of their iniquity for behold they had hardened their hearts against him that they had become like unto a flint wherefore as they were white and exceedingly fair and delightsome that they might not be enticing unto my people the lord god did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them
7047111 and it came to pass that those lamanites who had united with the nephites were numbered among the nephites and their curse was taken from them and their skin became white like unto the nephites and their young men and their daughters became exceeding fair
7047112 o my brethren i fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of god

7047135 we have shown that in so many races this year it was a good lap and i think we have a good car for the race the first sector was just fantastic i made some small mistakes in sector two and then i had a good sector three the track was getting better all the time it was so green because of the big rain shower yesterday this morning was difficult
7047136 felipe s first sector on his last flying lap destroyed everyone
7047137 i didnt think my first lap was great but the last lap was pretty good i was happy with it it is a good starting position for tomorrow
7047138 the pace of the car is not as bad as before
7047139 it was definitely a surprise to see some of the other teams up front and so quick
7047140 im already thinking im still in this but if i was all happy happy about bogeying eight and nine then i wouldnt be a competitor

7047143 you know stricker played a great round of golf in the morning and obviously played a great round of golf on thursday but the weekend is still in front of us
7047144 since i got older i just cant seem to tolerate anymore
7047145 i lost a bit of my concentration in the second set i dont know why but then i felt i was finding my game again
7047146 i guess i ran a out of gas a little bit after last week and the matches i played this week
7047147 i would have loved to play the last match tomorrow but it has been a good tournament im pretty satisfied about the way i played throughout the week it was a little bit tough to produce a good level of tennis tonight without being good enough physically but i will stay on what i did in the first three matches and just look forward from here
7047148 it was too late to win the second set i came back from 1 5 to 3 5 before she won it but i got off to a good start in the third set and im really pleased with how i played that one
7047149 i just concentrate really well during all my finals i hope it will be the same tomorrow

7047151 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
7047152 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
7047153 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
7047154 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
7047155 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
7047156 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
7047157 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
7047158 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
7047159 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
7047160 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

7047184 because he is such a nice guy and great ambassador for the sport everyone in british canoeing was quietly hoping he would achieve his dream
7047185 london is definitely on the cards now dont be surprised to see me in london ready to represent great britain again
7047186 as with many british athletes i am sure the lure of 2012 will creep into his thinking
7047187 tim is such an athlete i have no doubt he could easily carry on to 2012 he is blessed with amazing physiological qualities
7047188 the key is putting maximum downward pressure on the blade and exerting the most power to pull the boat past the paddle

7047190 hopefully we will have become one of their priority sports and they will have the confidence to invest in us knowing we will deliver the results
7047191 we are comparatively low profile compared to rowing but the potential is there for canoeing to make a big contribution to 2012
7047192 i am completely destroyed its too much to take in
7047193 it was pretty bad i think they were holding onto the hope he would still be alive when he was found so everyone has taken it very badly they think he fell into a landfill part of the site and no one noticed so lorries were continually dropping rubbish on him
7047194 i think there was about 40 tonnes of the stuff police searching that part of the site spent the whole day just pulling back all that rubbish
7047195 hes site supervisor they work six days a week and hes always been on site hes never late for work hes the most reliable person there
7047196 he was beside the vehicles that manoeuvre the waste into a pile one look he was there the next he wasnt his locker was full of his clothes his trainers his jacket his bag his keys
7047197 we are all shocked by this dreadful event and our thoughts and condolences are with our colleagues family at this very sad time
7047198 at present we do not know the full circumstances that resulted in this tragic situation and are fully co operating with the police in their investigation we are of course also immediately undertaking our own investigation but we cannot comment on the possible cause of this incident until the full facts are known
7047199 im really really deeply saddened by the outcome its such a shock for his wife and the rest of his family and i offer them my deepest sympathy

7047210 a gifted player maybe the second purest talent in this class after kevin durant
7047211 he could really be a rebounding threat right now if he chose to focus on that
7047212 a special talent and is better offensively than scouts initially thought
7047213 to beat defenders from the high post by using solid jabs and counters when they take his jump shot away
7047214 with yi we feel his upside is very up we feel strongly hes going to be a very good player for us
7047215 being a rookie it was pretty tough plus with him coming to the states for the first year to play basketball that was big and as a first round pick theres a lot of pressure i experienced that with kwame brown in washington and its an adjustment yi hung in pretty well his first year
7047216 maybe more so than in a normal year when youre not trying to host the olympics
7047217 i sense that once the olympics are over and he has a chance to catch his breath and has a year under his belt his future is going to be real bright and some of that pressure will be relieved a little bit
7047218 the chinese basketball association can be a major pain in the caboose
7047219 they would call their players nba team and wonder why he didnt play more after a victory theyd call with suggestions of how many minutes would be best from week to week yis a great kid with a lot of pressure on him hes going to need a lot of help from his nba family but we doubt his new family fully understands what kind of marriage theyve just entered into
7047220 our doctors said he was one of the best physical specimens of anybody on our team hes young so i dont think it will be a problem
7047221 it will be a new team a new atmosphere and a new beginning for me the nets worked hard to get me and i feel honored
7047222 they play a fast tempo and are younger i think i can be part of the rotation in no time
7047223 its just challenging everybody on our team making everybody understand that each game is important you only have so many left
7047224 thats something richard jefferson and i tried to do with sean at halftime constructive criticism nothing like yelling it was like look youre a good player play like it be the person that you are and it was a different sean williams in the second half
7047225 ive been blessed to be in the playoffs every year but some of the younger guys have to understand that this is an opportunity you have to seize because nothing is guaranteed
7047226 that means you have to make sure youre getting extra work in you got to know the game plan youve got to do all the things you need to do
7047227 big picture its how much of a basketball feel he can continue to develop
7047228 hes a little bit small to be a 4 man in the nba and yet he doesnt have the perimeter skills or feel to be a 3 man
7047229 seans year was like a lot of rookies he had some early success fell back a little and then had some more success around the all star break then after the all star break did not have much success so i think he played more games this year than he has every played by far im sure he got a little tired as the season wore on i heard him saying several times that his legs felt heavy
7047230 specifically i want to work at my aggressiveness on the boards and just knowledge of the game every time i play i learn something about the game i just want to keep playing so i can learn and get better at the game im still young at this game and i feel my ceiling is very high i still cant even touch it with as much height as i have
7047231 they just dont build guys like this not very often anyway
7047232 he reminded me very much of dirk nowitzki when i first started working with dirk hes a little more athletic certainly at the same age talent wise it is all there hes as good as anybody in the draft
7047233 athletically hes certainly in the top 10 percent of the league athletically and has an upside and its up to us and to him to make sure that he does what he needs to do in order to get better

7047336 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7047337 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7047338 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7047339 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7047340 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7047341 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7047342 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7047343 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7047344 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7047345 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7047346 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7047347 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7047348 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7047349 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7047350 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7047351 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7047352 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7047353 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7047354 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7047355 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7047356 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7047357 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7047358 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7047359 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7047360 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7047361 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

7047370 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7047371 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7047372 ada 10 virus baru yang banyak dilaporkan menyebar di indonesia ditambahkan pada
7047373 anda dapat mengenali dan membasmi virus lebih banyak lagi jadi total tambahan virus sampai update build3 kali ini adalah sebanyak 30 virus
7047374 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7047375 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7047376 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7047377 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7047378 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7047379 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7047380 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7047381 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7047382 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7047383 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7047384 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7047385 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7047386 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7047387 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7047388 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7047389 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7047390 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
7047391 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
7047392 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
7047393 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
7047394 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
7047395 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
7047396 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7047397 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7047398 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7047399 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7047400 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7047401 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7047402 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7047403 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7047404 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7047405 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7047406 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7047407 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7047408 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7047409 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7047410 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7047411 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7047412 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7047413 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7047414 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7047415 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7047416 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7047417 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7047418 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7047419 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7047420 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7047421 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7047422 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7047423 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7047424 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7047425 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7047426 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7047427 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7047428 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7047429 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7047430 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7047431 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7047432 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7047433 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7047434 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7047435 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7047436 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7047437 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7047438 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7047439 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7047440 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7047441 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7047442 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7047443 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7047444 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7047445 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7047446 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7047447 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7047448 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7047449 in the future who and how will your service be performed
7047450 stop worrying soon take me to vrindaban where your gurus son lives
7047451 how will such a big deity be carried over to vrindaban where will it be seated in what way will its service and worship be arranged
7047452 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7047453 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7047454 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7047455 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7047456 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7047457 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7047458 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7047459 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7047460 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7047461 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7047462 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7047463 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7047464 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7047465 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7047466 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7047467 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7047468 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7047469 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7047470 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7047471 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7047472 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7047473 my family is truly blessed with all of you who love us and keep praying and thinking about us
7047474 my family is truly blessed with all of you who love us and keep praying and thinking about us
7047475 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7047476 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7047477 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7047478 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7047479 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7047480 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7047481 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7047482 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7047483 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7047484 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7047485 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7047486 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7047487 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7047488 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7047489 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7047490 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7047491 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7047492 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7047493 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7047494 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7047495 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7047496 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7047497 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7047498 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7047499 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7047500 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7047501 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7047502 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7047503 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7047504 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7047505 is one of the vital conditionsmake their thoughts selective they take the good and reject the bad
7047506 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7047507 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7047508 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7047509 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7047510 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7047511 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7047512 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7047513 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7047514 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7047515 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7047516 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7047517 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7047518 you may have often seen in the movies or even read in books about 911 the number the united states denizens dial incase of emergency situations now a similar service is being introduced in india by the emergency management and research institute emri which is soon about to launch this service in madhya pradesh in a recent statement health minister ambumani ramadoss was intimated by union telecom minister a raja that 108 is being finalized as the national toll free trauma care number to the institution it was further informed that 108 is already being used as the toll free emergency number in indian states such as gujarat andhra pradesh and uttarakhand on the other hand even states like rajasthan madhya pradesh and tamil nadu have inked mou with the emri institute for availing this service indian states like jammu and kashmir assam and kerala too are charting plans for fixing the number 108 for all emergency purposes every time a caller dials 108 his or her call will be received by a 24 hour call centre which will take down all important information from the caller after this the call centre will locate an ambulance fire vehicle or the police vehicle depending on the type of emergency through gprs technology and dispatch it to where the help is needed the emri institute has received top recognition in the health care category at the 2008 computer world honours programme

7047560 that guy who wont stop honking his horn is really annoying
7047561 we understand what is behind russias position we believe this is a response to georgian provocation we support moscow in this and are against any attempts to blacken russia
7047562 to consider the offers of the syrian government in connection to the delivery of new weapons only for defence purposes
7047563 we are not going to slam the door on nato nato could slam this door though everything depends on natos priorities if the priorities are absolutely supportive of saakashvilis bankrupt regime to the detriment of partnership with russia then it is not our fault
7047564 we looked at what we could do to address them and the whole area of air quality as it relates to the emission of ammonia from poultry houses
7047565 weve certainly been on a learning curve since 2001 about the different plant materials suitable for this practice we typically recommend the first row nearest the fans to be either a deciduous tree or a tree with a waxy leaf surface and the other two rows be an evergreen
7047566 its very important to realize there are a number of criteria that you use in tree selection and planting design what works for our soil types and climate on the delmarva peninsula may not be suitable for other locations
7047567 one initial concern was that it takes years for trees to grow to become effective in filtering out poultry house emissions but thats not necessarily the case
7047568 planting trees demonstrates that the poultry grower is being proactive to address potential concerns of neighbors gives the poultry farm a landscape appearance and increases property values adding the vegetative buffers also helps to reduce noise associated with farm operations
7047569 the easiest way for your children to learn about money is for you not to have any

7047572 the example of a good companion and a bad one is the bearer of musk and the worker on the bellows a bearer of musk would give you some you might buy some from him or you might enjoy the fragrance of his musk the worker on the bellows on the other hand might spoil your clothes with sparks from his bellows or you get a bad smell from him

7047575 real madrid would never retain a player on the team against his wishes and would have no choice but to call for a unilateral resolution of the contract if the player willed it so
7047576 given the high personal and professional esteem that the club has always held the player in as he deserves
7047577 when it happened i was just acting in the moment of the game
7047578 it is a birth defect but at the time i can tell you honestly i didnt know that i just saw it like i was making fun of someone for acne or a crooked nose at the time i didnt see it as a big deal
7047579 looking back at it ive learned from it and you have to be careful about what you say on the ice ive met him off the ice now and hes probably one of the nicest guys
7047580 since children are extra prone to temptation a similar ban should come in the neighborhood of schools eating fast food as well as other calory rich consumption must become an exception it cannot become a habit

7047584 they want their babies circumcised in the comfort of their homes surrounded by family and friends and they want it performed by someone highly experienced who brings spirituality and meaning to the practice
7047585 and its over in 30 seconds compared to what hospitals do which can be from 20 to 45 minutes with the baby strapped down

7047588 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
7047589 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
7047590 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
7047591 fails to give assurances that current laws about abortion will not be stretched to cover birth control
7047592 this proposal ensures that doctors and other medical personnel will retain the constitutional right to listen to their own conscience when it comes to performing or participating in an abortion
7047593 these regulations will ensure that pro life medical personnel will not be forced to engage in the unconscionable killing of innocent human life
7047594 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
7047595 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused abortion and physicians conscience
7047596 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
7047597 i take a regular interest in world affairs and all the important news including about tibet but im meant to respect the olympic charter

7047603 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
7047604 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7047605 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7047606 complimentary this is an incredible guy cmon hes a phenomenon
7047607 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7047608 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7047609 this is not exactly a safe selection for obama with over 30 years of baggage accumulated in the u s senate biden is not the kind of running mate you would think of for someone who has campaigned on a pledge to change the way politics is done in washington
7047610 but it does signal that obama may be more of a realist than his rhetoric suggests and shows that the change candidate has decided that a wealth of experience may be important to an administration after all
7047611 i dont want the job im not going to take the job
7047612 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend id be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off no matter who won
7047613 i need a president who will work with me who will be there for the people i care about that i get up and fight for every single day
7047614 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well
7047615 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
7047616 its absurd a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards

7047625 it features tv auditions bitchy judges performance anxieties theyre all there
7047626 there are two directions you can go with this research
7047627 some might say this suggests that parents should have their kids attend places of worship
7047628 or if we use it to help explain why religious participation has a positive effect on academics parents who arent interested in attending church can consider how to structure their kids time to allow access to the same beneficial social networks and opportunities religious institutions provide
7047629 surprisingly the importance of religion to teens had very little impact on their educational outcomes
7047630 that suggests that the act of attending church the structure and the social aspects associated with it could be more important to educational outcomes than the actual religion
7047631 n s vimos que na volta de classifica o de felipe ele destruiu todos no primeiro trecho ent o ser duro derrot lo amanh

7047636 com certeza sempre bom estar no topo depois de um resultado ruim especialmente pelo problema que aconteceu
7047637 bom alinhar ne pole e ter melhores possibilidades na corrida ent o vamos tentar fazer uma tima prova neste domingo
7047638 as you might imagine with 23 analysts working on quite discrete industries and companies the challenge is to bring order to diverse sets of information and understanding and to then synthesise it into coherent portfolios comprising individual stocks
7047639 another hurdle for a fund manager that follows a stock picking approach as opposed to hugging the in crowd is to avoid acting too early
7047640 we have an excellent record of anticipating emerging themes but need to improve our degree of anticipation
7047641 i cant think of anything except boiling it and cutting into half and swallowing

7047644 the costs of digital television outweigh the benefits by far
7047645 if you go in with a simple box you will lose the opportunity to offer additional services
7047646 in other markets we experienced that prices will fall down by 20 to 30 every year
7047647 i asked the government why their decoders are so much more expensive they told me it was because of the cream on top
7047648 you cannot use your box outside south africa they dont want people to buy it cheaply here and go abroad
7047649 a hundred rand extra would be acceptable but more than double the price of current standard decoders doesnt make sense
7047650 a wide range of boxes will be developed with different prices and different possibilities
7047651 its possible that you only get this code if you buy a tv licence
7047652 like mobile phone companies they offer cheap phones because they make their money out of the calling costs
7047653 but they make it more intense to people to buy one a decoder and you will pay a price for it
7047654 we are talking about an unknown population the poorest of the poor
7047655 we are expecting a mass roll out that requires both information and product distribution in an environment where most of the beneficiaries are rural or deep rural households
7047656 there is no chance that they will make the deadline it will take one year to develop a good decoder and then there is only two years left to roll out six million decoders to the public
7047657 whenever you extend it people will always wait till the last moment

7047816 but the player said that he wished to go a little bit higher and get into the championship and so it has proved

7047821 we have got three big games and i think that is enough for us to deal with if we have any problems that we just suddenly pick up then we might have to look at it

7047828 they the military are not hitting the known targets of the militants but blitzing the civilian abodes
7047829 the internally displaced people of bajaur said the troops did not target the militant centres which are located at stone throws distance from their bases

7047840 baghdad ha perduto la sua bellezza e non ne rimasto che il nome rispetto a ci che essa era un tempo prima che gli eventi la colpissero e gli occhi delle calamit si rivolgessero a lei essa non pi che una traccia annullata o una sembianza di emergente fantasma
7047841 first of all i went to denmark where about 400 chaldean families live concentrated in copenhagen and in arhus the second largest city in the country and where i will return on next december for the inauguration of the first church dedicated to the chaldean rite in denmark months ago in fact an agreement was signed with the catholic bishop of copenhagen mgr czeslaw kozon and on september the works will begin in the church for the official opening the church which will also have a hall able to accommodate 70 people and where to carry out pastoral activities serve the community of copenhagen that of arhus 300 km from the capital will continue to attend the local church of the jesuits after denmark i went to meet the community who lives in holland and has about 750 families in six cities and i celebrated a mass in born
7047842 yes like every year the chaldean community in europe gathers in banneux where a mass is celebrated in the shrine of our lady of the poor on august 15 given the concomitant presence in europe of mgr shleimun warduni patriarch vicar of baghdad who in those days had celebrated the ordination of three sub deacons for the chaldean church in stuttgart the mass was celebrated by him while i was entrusted with the preaching there were about 3500 people from many european countries and even some families from the united states there were also several priests father sami al rais from essen father cesar from stuttgart father raad washan from vienna father faris toma from denmark father suleyman oz from belgium a priest actually studying in rome and two chaldean monks who live in rome the two hours long mass was followed by a meeting with the community in the gardens of the shrine all the day was a moment of beautiful and important spiritual communion climate the presence of mgr warduni as a representative of the patriarchate testified the attention to the diaspora in these difficult times and was also an opportunity to bring together the european community and their priests
7047843 yes in early september at the church of the byzantine catholic exarchate in athens where our community meets there will be a spiritual retreat for the priests in europe that i will preside after it and thanks to the kindness of archbishop dimitrios salachas we will spend a few days of vacation in a house of the arcbishopric near the sea it will be a way for priests to know each other better and exchange their impressions and ideas on the role of pastors of the diaspora communities
7047844 certainly it has been a good experience crowned by the success of another church for the chaldean community in europe and by the presence of so many priests and faithful who showed through it their strong bond with the church a bond not broken by their being far from their motherland the bond that made and makes us strong
7047845 i cant think of any other reason or any other party with an interest
7047846 we are following the development and if they are looking for a provocation we will know how to avoid it
7047847 we are not experienced sailors as a result there is concern about the health and safety of the people on board
7047848 i brought the kids so if they the activists arrive i can tell them welcome and thank you for not forgetting us
7047849 baghdad ha perduto la sua bellezza e non ne rimasto che il nome rispetto a ci che essa era un tempo prima che gli eventi la colpissero e gli occhi delle calamit si rivolgessero a lei essa non pi che una traccia annullata o una sembianza di emergente fantasma

7047889 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7047890 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition
7047891 the olympics are a prism for the conflicts emotions and tendencies that are being worked out and worked out in public
7047892 hoped to show the world a china that after 30 years of rapid development has not been seen in hundreds of years
7047893 cheering for foreign teams would have been unimaginable four years ago much less 20 years ago
7047894 this is the beauty of dictatorship they can do many things that other countries cannot do
7047895 you have to remember they even controlled the weather no other country would do this
7047896 the olympic games are all about sport it is about the olympic spirit it is not a political platform
7047897 we are expecting it will take around four or five weeks to create the store and we want to open before christmas

7047900 we are really looking forward to opening the store it has been a long time coming and so we cant wait to get started

7047911 its a well intentioned notion he has but its a very na ve way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
7047912 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7047913 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training

7047915 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
7047916 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7047917 no that is not true we have not pulled out of the champions trophy but we have advised the icc about our considerable concern and we have made sure that they understand that we will not go anywhere which is not safe we are waiting to hear from them later this evening
7047918 ca at this stage hasnt made any official decision to not tour we are waiting to hear from icc the ball is in their court
7047919 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe
7047920 the only issue that is important for us is the safety and security of the players and the advice we get from our range of sources
7047921 we are aware of south africas decision but we will comment only after discussing various aspects of the issue during the icc board teleconference on sunday
7047922 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think south africa made a hasty choice
7047923 now its up to the icc to take a decision but i would say south africas refusal will badly hurt the event we will still do our best to save the event and host it on schedule
7047924 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
7047925 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
7047926 we appreciate all the efforts of the icc task team the pcb the pakistan authorities and the security consultants
7047927 the players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in september
7047928 our board is meeting with the icc on friday and i will be present at that meeting to convey our concerns
7047929 we have taken note of various security assessment reports including one from the federation of international cricketers associations fica nicholls steyn the icc consultants and another by our own government
7047930 i have also been in constant touch with our players in england over this and the mood among them is that the concerns remain
7047931 you cant rule out the possibility of a cancellation considering the absolute lack of a consensus at this stage
7047932 if countries like australia pull out there is no question of the tournament going ahead with substitutes like bangladesh
7047933 obviously ess wants the best teams to participate and ensure a world class tournament
7047934 it is possible to ensure quality coverage if it is shifted to a nearby country even now but it will involve significant extra costs for the broadcaster
7047935 we are still fighting and are hopeful of hosting the tournament
7047936 again though i ask what do we do with these men and yes women who have served what

7047994 it has been a very good qualifying for myself and the team after some unlucky races
7047995 the pace of the car here in valencia is not as bad as it was before but also we are missing a bit of time to ferrari and mclaren
7047996 qualifying went pretty smoothly only the weather was playing a bit we were anticipating everyone to make sure we would be fine with the laptime to go into next qualifying
7047997 rain didnt have an effect only in qualifying two there were some drops after corner 10 in the last part of the back straight but it didnt have any effect
7047998 it has been an incredibly frustrating day for us today we were not able to find a balance on the car in practice this morning which affected our preparations for qualifying this afternoon i particularly struggled with rear locking which cost me a lot of time as i wasnt able to attack the lap its very disappointing to be starting the first race here from so far back on the grid
7047999 our free practice pace was genuine and we have definitely made some improvements to the car over the break and here this week
7048000 it was a really disappointing qualifying today particularly as we have been quick all weekend
7048001 my first run on the prime tyres was good but we simply chose the wrong tyre for my final run in q1 i had no grip with the option and it just wasnt very competitive for us
7048002 my final run was slower than my prime run which shouldnt happen on a circuit which is improving all the time im really disappointed as we have improved the car but today we didnt make the most of that
7048003 it has been an incredibly frustrating day for us today
7048004 we were not able to find a balance on the car in practice this morning which affected our preparations for qualifying
7048005 after our difficult practice yesterday we completely changed my set up for today
7048006 then we had a gearbox oil pump problem this morning that meant i could not try it out so in a way i was driving blind this afternoon but i used my experience i concentrated very hard and i made it through into q3
7048007 i made a mistake on my last run but i am still very happy with what we achieved today im also delighted with the way the car is developing and the fact that we can always fight for the top ten and score points that is again our target tomorrow
7048008 its important and realistic and it will be an interesting race here more than anywhere anything can happen and it should be a great event
7048009 i dont know what went wrong but i just didnt get the lap together in the second session and that was that
7048010 we definitely had the chance to be higher in the top ten but it was a difficult qualifying in the end

7048016 i dont know what went wrong but i just didnt get the lap together in the second session and that was that
7048017 so it was just not my day today i had a heavy cold overnight and didnt feel particularly well but no excuses i think the car was good enough but it just didnt work out of course we will do our best to make up positions tomorrow there could be safety car periods so we will aim to make the most of our freedom with the strategy
7048018 altogether it has been a very difficult day and a disappointing qualifying result

7048248 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
7048249 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7048250 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger

7048259 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7048260 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7048261 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7048262 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates

7048288 screw it if i get this done im going down in cal history
7048289 we were manhandled we were threatened not to protest at this event i think that needs to be said we were made to sign a document not to protest for the betterment of taekwondo it was a very big thing there was a table you went up to the table and you signed the document you signed it in front of the secretary general of the wtf and you gave him the document
7048290 it is not an agreement i would call it a resolution a resolution on fair play it was do your best to ensure fair play and judging appealing is up to them its their right and their rule they can appeal ask him the right wordings on what he signed
7048291 respect and accept the judgment and decisions of the refereeing and technical officials in all taekwondo competitions
7048292 the wtf wanted everybody to have more self control and if they want to make a protest take the correct procedure actually not to jump up and down and make a ruckus raise a lot of noise
7048293 they wtf officials dont think about the repercussions until after they make a mistake
7048294 they know the power we have as a family and bringing limelight to our sport by no means do i want to bring this sport down i love this sport but sometimes in any sport there are judges there are politics involved unfortunately theres not supposed to be that in any of the sports but you see it all the time whether it be gymnastics boxing it happens there are bad calls all the time this is one of the times that it happened to me it normally doesnt but it happened it sucks
7048295 these people who conspired to make this hoax brought all the research down in my opinion
7048296 it kind of upset me weve been at this for years now and were trying to prove these things are real
7048297 we have these urban legends and we are kind of raised thinking these things might exist
7048298 so much of what we believe is developed by what scientists call the method of authority you have questions as a child you ask an authority figure who ought to know the answer and you believe what they say
7048299 those reports that are credible suggest there are pockets of sasquatch families living in and around dense tree cover usually in higher elevations
7048300 the bottom line is nobody has come up with smoking gun evidence that is really good enough
7048301 they have not found a single bone when the hair samples are analyzed its always some unknown animal or another species the hair samples never turn out to be an unknown ape
7048302 i dont care how many expeditions they go on they wont find this creature
7048303 we are doing it because we love it we want to find out the scientists wont believe until somebody comes up with a body
7048304 thats one piece of his soul that wont be back

7048311 at this stage there is no indication to suggest that knives or weapons were involved but we believe this group came to the tower block for a specific purpose
7048312 for reasons which we continue to investigate this caused ahmed and his friends to leave the flats
7048313 ahmed was separated from his friends and climbed on to the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on and he lost his grip
7048314 after this point he fell to his death there is no indication that ahmed was assaulted before he fell
7048315 having recovered cctv evidence it is apparent that after ahmed fell five of the six youths left the area they were seen riding on pedal cycles along paragon road away from mare street
7048316 one of the male youths left the area on foot leaving his bicycle at the scene police have recovered this and it is being forensically examined
7048317 it might strike you as something out of the blue it may be complete nonsense it might have much truth even an underlying meaning a strange motive yes a frank meaning yes where does one begin and the other end i dont know or maybe im not saying send me a picture and then well be on the road to being even thank you please

7048332 the real price of a gold medal would be much higher
7048333 ais programs are focused on looking to medal success in olympics
7048334 they have all got to be looked at what are the reasons for the relative failure can it be turned around what are the priorities
7048335 weve got to ask serious questions about how we spend money in elite sports and what sports we target
7048336 we will be just one spot off what we had hoped for
7048337 if were seen as a bunch of losers who cant win a medal people will think they dont want their money being wasted
7048338 were never going to be able to compete dollar for dollar with much larger populations and economies and when you look at it per capita australians are incredibly generous

7048347 michael wie hast du das qualifying auf dieser brandneuen strecke in valencia erlebt
7048348 wir haben uns gut auf diese strecke vorbereitet und wir m ssen sicherlich jetzt auf angriff schalten das haben wir in budapest auch schon gemacht aber nach dem unsch nen ausscheiden von felipe m ssen wir nat rlich schon ein bisschen gas geben damit wir wieder rankommen kimi ist auch in einer sehr guten position aber felipe hat es heute super umgesetzt
7048349 wenn man sich das training heute morgen angeschaut hat dann waren wir ziemlich zuversichtlich felipe hat es wie immer geschafft eine cleane saubere runde hinzubekommen absolut am limit das war wieder felipe like
7048350 offensichtlich hat felipe auch das lernen der neuen strecke am besten hinbekommen wie war das damals f r dich wenn du auf eine neue strecke gekommen bist
7048351 felipe hat es offensichtlich sehr gut hinbekommen gar keine frage kimi war auf harten reifen unterwegs hat diese bevorzugt obwohl ich mir da nicht ganz so sicher bin vielleicht w ren doch die weichen schneller gewesen
7048352 die strecke hat sich nat rlich auch ein bisschen ver ndert heute morgen waren wohl die harten schneller aber jetzt hat sich das blatt ein bisschen ge ndert es ist nat rlich auch eine balancefrage man kann sich nicht einfach umentscheiden und pl tzlich sagen man wechselt auf softs denn dann stimmt die feinabstimmung nicht mehr insofern hat es f r felipe sehr gut geklappt
7048353 das kr fteverh ltnis ist ein bisschen gekippt was ist derzeit mit kimi los
7048354 wir haben gesehen dass einer auf harten reifen unterwegs war der andere auf weichen reifen vielleicht war das der grund warum da unterschiede vorhanden sind aber man muss auch dazusagen dass felipe einfach ein sehr guter qualifyer ist im rennen sind sie dann manchmal ein bisschen hnlicher was den speed angeht es ist nat rlich ein problem wenn man festh ngt wie kimi in budapest denn dann kann man nicht seine leistung zeigen
7048355 gigantisch das ganze wochenende macht er schon einen superjob immerhin sind zwei toro rossos in den top 10 und die zwei red bulls drau en zum einen muss man da sicherlich das team loben weil sie beide fahrer reinbekommen haben aber zum anderen muss man auch ganz klar sebastian in den vordergrund stellen der nicht nur in q1 und q2 eine superrunde hinbekommen hat sondern auch jetzt sechster geworden ist das ist schon gigantisch
7048356 wie gef llt dir die stadt valencia wie findest du die atmosph re hier
7048357 ich muss gestehen ich kenne die stadt nicht wirklich auch wenn wir fr her immer hier getestet haben waren wir meistens au erhalb der stadt ich bin heute morgen erst angekommen also kann ich leider nicht allzu viel dazu sagen das ambiente hier an der strecke ist sehr angenehm
7048358 wirst du selbst mit dem roller mal eine runde fahren und dir die strecke anschauen

7048749 hidupmu bagaikan sebuah mosaik disaat aku sedang menghancurkanmu berkeping keping musuh memasukkan beberapa keping kelemahan ia memakai keadaanmu untuk memecah belah jiwamu ia mencoba mempertahankan kehancuran didalammu agar engkau tak dapat membentuk keadaan dan visi yang baru bagi masa depanmu namun akulah abba bapamu akulah pribadi yang mengenalmu sedari awal aku tahu bagaimana menghancurkanmu akulah pribadi yang mengetahui rancangan dan rencana yang terbaik bagimu meski musuh memasukkan keping lain didalammu aku melakukan pembedahan untuk membuang keping yang salah ini sekarang adalah masa yang sukar bagimu karena inilah musim pembersihan dan pemisahan aku mengasihimu dan akan membersihkan dan memindahkan bagian yang kupotong dengan hikmat dan kasihku bersiaplah karena berbagai kebaikan dan hikmatku akan engkau terima dengan cara baru engkau akan menampilkan kuasa untuk mengalahkan dunia yang telah menjeratmu bangkit jadilah terang dan memancarlah aku mengelilingi warisanku dengan kemuliaan engkau akan mendengar panggilan baru aku menyingkapkan beberapa area dimana warisanku tidak dipenuhi dengan kemuliaan sebaliknya dengan kutuk untuk memperluas pengaruhmu aku akan menguasai area tersebut penundaan hal yang membuang waktuku adalah musuh terbesar dalam meraih rancanganku ia bersaing denganmu dalam memperoleh kemakmuran yang telah kusediakan bagimu sekarang dan masa depanmu kedagingan berusaha melawan kekuatan umatku bangkitlah bangunkan fajar goncangkan pekerjaan iblis segeralah membajak dan majulah di ladang yang telah kusiapkan bagimu semangat baru sedang terbit atasmu bangun dan bangkitlah

7048751 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7048752 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue

7048754 i think he has played very well in the olympic tournament
7048755 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor
7048756 i think it the game had been played in another part of the day it would have been very different
7048757 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7048758 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7048759 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7048760 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7048761 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7048762 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices

7048771 once when you were still very young my husband and i were going to take you and cindy trick or treating your father called and i told him and he said absolutely not i couldnt believe it he was very polite about it he didnt yell but he said you were not to go with us i was furious and i told him mr smiley i am not going to deny that child what all the other kids do now my husband and i are going with the children in stone canyon and im sorry but luellen is going with us while we were walking through the neighborhood i noticed a black cadillac following us stopping when we did and so forth so i went over to the driver may i ask why you are following us the driver says to me sorry smileys orders well i never heard of such a thing now i didnt know anything about your father and if i did it wouldnt have mattered he cared very much and he was worried about you

7048773 i dont think anything can be more motivational than going down the way we did after having the season we did
7048774 we have an awful lot of exceptional young student athletes here so their expectations are quite high
7048775 their motivation is quite high so its a whole lot easier to take a motivating route and channel their energies into being successful than it is to take a group that you have to push all the time
7048776 i think you dont replace a player like mami yamaguchi
7048777 she was special but we certainly have some other young talents to come in and take some of the burden and responsibility of putting the ball in the back of the net
7048778 shes our team leader and our captain shes the emotional leader of the team
7048779 i dont know if anyone does as good a job as she does of keeping us motivated on the field
7048780 shes always yelling always saying something she makes you feel im 5 foot 3 on a good day and she makes me feel like i could beat out a 6 foot 2 girl in the air
7048781 were playing a lot of teams with very successful traditions and were expecting those teams to be back in the ncaa tournament

7048851 the a49 has been the scene of far too many fatal and serious accidents including the loss of two talented youngsters from craven arms earlier this month
7048852 the road is particularly dangerous as it passes through the constituency from south of church stretton to south of ludlow
7048853 although the highways agency is responsible for the a49 south of shrewsbury we hold regular liaison meetings to highlight improvements that we believe will help to ensure the safety of road users
7048854 we also work with local communities and parish councils to understand local concerns on road safety

7048866 we see the adoption of the fla by kde as a positive and important milestone in the maturity of the free software community

7048884 so there is a vast majority of their population that is under the age of 20 in terms trying to engage those young people and get them into positive activities will give them a positive outlet
7048885 hopefully by engaging the younger people in those neighborhoods it will build a stronger bond to the community

7048918 double the number of science technology engineering and mathematics graduates with bachelors degrees by 2015
7048919 u s stem bachelors degree production not on track to meet tap goal
7048920 the bureau of labor statistics projects that employment in science and engineering occupations will grow 70 percent faster than the overall growth for all occupations
7048921 in 2006 the already low unemployment rate for stem graduates dropped to 2 5 percent and starting salaries were higher for students graduating with stem degrees particularly those with engineering degrees than for most other majors
7048922 there is a desperate need for stem majors to teach math and science at us schools research indicates that a highly qualified teacher is one of the most important factors in raising student achievement
7048923 which provides scholarships for stem undergraduate majors who agree to become k 12 math and science teachers

7048928 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7048929 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7048930 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7048931 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7048932 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7048933 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices

7048948 the message in a bottle was really quite a find and surprised us all and were delighted to be able to reunite the owner with this piece of history
7048949 it really is quite remarkable that the bottle should be found after all this time who knows where it has travelled to in the last quarter of a century
7048950 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7048951 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7048952 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7048953 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
7048954 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7048955 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7048956 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7048957 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7048958 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birth date
7048959 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
7048960 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
7048961 if you trust every web site but not a government
7048962 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7048963 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7048964 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7048965 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
7048966 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
7048967 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
7048968 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
7048969 i hated you for heras but i now i hate you fair and square

7048971 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7048972 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition
7048973 the olympics are a prism for the conflicts emotions and tendencies that are being worked out and worked out in public
7048974 hoped to show the world a china that after 30 years of rapid development has not been seen in hundreds of years
7048975 cheering for foreign teams would have been unimaginable four years ago much less 20 years ago
7048976 this is the beauty of dictatorship they can do many things that other countries cannot do
7048977 you have to remember they even controlled the weather no other country would do this
7048978 the olympic games are all about sport it is about the olympic spirit it is not a political platform
7048979 people now realize its not such a simple matter its not just like opening the door and inviting guests in
7048980 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7048999 aqu no me lo quita nadie voy con aspiraciones nadie me va a quitar la ilusi n entreno para la medalla es dif cil porque s lo hay tres pero ese sue o no me lo va a quitar nadie
7049000 me he entrenado muy bien y los juegos me vienen en un momento incre ble
7049001 he sido segundo en roma d cimo en osaka el a o pasado y gan en madrid creo que estoy en plenitud en mi madurez personal y deportiva no me afectan tanto los nervios ni la presi n s lo tengo que llegar all y plasmar todo lo que he entrenado y como he entrenado mucho espero que lo pueda hacer bien
7049002 todav a me queda un cartucho en la rec mara tengo cuerda para rato no s hasta d nde voy a llegar pero voy a seguir es cierto que no me veo ya con opciones para los siguientes juegos ol mpicos y ahora lo tengo claro
7049003 creo que estamos muy alarmados pero espero que en china sea menos de lo que la gente dice
7049004 vamos a ganar 25 medallas el deporte espa ol vive un momento buen simo y tenemos que quitarnos complejos en atletismo cinco o seis y ojal pueda estar yo entre ellas
7049005 est el grupo de las sorpresas entre los que estoy puede que alguno ara e la medalla la diferencia entre ser tercero o cuarto es muy poquita va a ser dif cil pero a ver c mo sale
7049006 tambi n cuento con nadal el ciclismo el tenis y la vela son medallas claras luego est el judo que siempre da alegr as o el pirag ismo hay un batiburrillo de deportes en que podemos optar a ellas
7049007 ahora hay una generaci n de deportistas en espa a que no tiene complejos y que hayan conseguido esas cosas nos hace subirnos a su carro de ganadores no tenemos complejos ni miedo a nada nunca vas a conseguir ganar una carrera una competici n un partido si no te lo crees y ahora gracias a nadal alonso y gasol nos hemos sumado a ese tren
7049008 una grandiosa estrategia militar que toma los deseos por realidades cuanto mas ambiciosa mas sorpresas inesperadas gastar dinero si saben pero responder a los problemas pol tico sociales nada de nada es mas debido a su abundancia flotan en una burbuja y no han aprendido nada todo el monte es or gano sus medios no llegan a sus fines por que son fantasmag ricos y donde han estado en el pasado acumulan un lastre que les bloquea el futuro
7049009 if youve got the confidence hes got its right its such a big stage the whole worlds watching you so if at the end of the day you can perform like many people have performed over here and especially him you can gloat its good to see
7049010 obviously i think that china can be very proud of what theyve done for these games we have seen what the chinese have done and im sure well better them without a doubt
7049011 obviously being an east end boy im very proud that i was involved in it in the first place bringing it back to england and regenerating so much interest
7049012 because of the success of this games so far not just obviously great britain but the success of the actual games its sort of hyping 2012 up which is going to be great
7049013 there was obviously a lot of negativity leading up to the competition but everyone knew that once the games actually started that would disappear and the success of the teams and the athletes would take over
7049014 politically im not even going to comment on that but at the end of the day its such a special people chinese people deserve a great event and theyve had that
7049015 i was very surprised i knew jamal was very strong and expecting to win the race i was not expecting to be a gold medalist
7049016 i just stayed behind them and then the last 300 i tried to push
7049017 its been a strange season this year i know ive been able to get those distances but its just not been there until today it was just the perfect time to get a big one
7049018 there is always pressure but the olympics feel similar to other championships i have been part of so many that i know how to handle the pressure
7049019 i came here as an underdog i had 1 45 compared to my competitors who had 1 42s
7049020 the only thing was to not panic at any time because if you panic definitely you will lose the race
7049021 when i look back at where i was in 2001 i never expected to be still running but i can say im happy i continued
7049022 they the kenyans have made every right decision in that race for the last 10 years
7049023 there were so many killed in kenya but in the end we at least have something to say
7049024 un punct e mai pu in dec t trei dar e mai bun dec t niciunul
7049025 its not easy to achieve this for me after hard work after so much effort
7049026 but if we were in the same position in the last lap maybe i could have caught up with him i expected myself to get a gold medal but i lost it and he was faster
7049027 im very proud that we kenyans did a really good job
7049028 ive called my family but they didnt pick up i guess theyre still yelling
7049029 my plan was to pick up the pace very fast
7049030 my mind my body my achilles i could not kick at all its been a tough two weeks for me
7049031 honestly i believe everything happens for a reason and i do believe with my injuries from my hamstring that i had to miss a lot of training because of that
7049032 its healthy now and i came and gave it my best at the games but i really believe it was bad timing when i got hurt
7049033 im definitely looking forward to 2012 i think ill be here as long as i take care of my body
7049034 i dont want to just go out without a fight
7049035 i really believe it is beatable i dont know if it is going to be me or somebody else but i think a lot of people will adapt and i think 9 7 to 9 6 will be a number that everyone will be running
7049036 i think it was a little bit of bad luck you know the u s was one of the only countries who had as much pressure as they had to perform
7049037 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno
7049038 io ti ho amato andr e non saprei neanche immaginare come si possa amare di pi

7049046 democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word equality but notice the difference while democracy seeks equality in liberty socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude
7049047 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7049048 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7049049 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility

7049066 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7049067 the creation of an utterly heavy and doomed out vibe
7049068 when you consider that it doesnt include another four years of secondary education plus five more years of medical school if he wants to follow his previously stated goal to grow up to be a doctor like his daddy this will come as an interminably deep chasm of drudgery and imprisonment to connor
7049069 its difficult to know the effect on his psychological well being when he grasps the full truth that his education will be followed by approximately four decades of work bills and taxes during which he will also rear his own children to face the same fate all of which will of course be followed by a brief almost inconsequential retirement and his inevitable death

7049085 cerrar la guardia arriba y golpeando no ten a opci n si quer a ganar ayer vi varias veces el video de su pelea con iglesias y sab a que esa ser a la clave de la victoria para no dejarle brincar y poner el ritmo a la pelea

7049093 she should not have turned her back on china to coach the opponents
7049094 i am proud that she is chinese but if she coached for china we would be going for the gold medal its too bad about this
7049095 americas volleyball team will be the most popular team in beijing because of lang ping
7049096 i will always be chinese even though i wear another countrys colors

7049101 some state governments have offered land to the tatas to shift their small car plant from singur but i would like to assert that the project will be a reality
7049102 i hope it will be implemented in time and the first car will roll out in october nobody can obstruct it
7049103 weve had individual victories before and we won our first medal when i was a kid in a small fishing village in iceland
7049104 and i remember vividly what a national celebration that was but for a small nation like mine to come with a whole team and to be victorious against some of the greatest nations nations that have millions and millions of people its not just the message for us in iceland i think its a message to the international sports movement that anything is possible
7049105 i think people are dancing in the workplaces in their homes
7049106 there will be celebrations long into the night nobody will do anything tomorrow and when the final will be played the whole country will come to a standstill
7049107 the important thing is to have given joy and happiness to 300 000 people who speak the same language that i do
7049108 if we win this were going to count them as 15 golds one for each player
7049109 i dont think i will have enough adrenaline to handle it

7049118 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7049119 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7049120 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats

7049127 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7049128 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7049129 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7049130 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7049131 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7049132 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7049133 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7049134 the strike is part of continuing protests against indias rule in kashmir

7049151 de mensen hier zouden zich de ogen uit hun kop moeten schamen
7049152 ze hebben hier zoveel moeite in gestoken ook jan des bouvrie en zo
7049153 jongens ik rook niet meer dus ik kan af en toe raar reageren
7049154 meiner meinung nach habe ich das maximum aus dem auto und die bestm gliche zeit herausgeholt schlussendlich sind wir um lediglich 1 3 sekunden von der schnellsten zeit der einheit entfernt
7049155 dies zeigt lediglich wie eng es nun zugeht aber ich denke nicht dass wir mehr h tten erreichen k nnen vom team war dies eine fantastische leistung das auto hat sich gut angef hlt es k nnte morgen ein rennen geben das man nicht vorhersehen kann lasst uns einmal schauen wie es l uft
7049156 der erste versuch war in ordnung die strecke verbesserte sich und das haftungsniveau wurde mit jeder runde besser
7049157 auf dem zweiten versuch hatte ich eine gute runde von einem kleinen fehler in kurve 14 abgesehen als ich zwei oder drei zehntelsekunden verlor aber es war dennoch nicht schlecht
7049158 auf meinem letzten versuch hatte ich dann ein paar probleme mit verkehr auf meiner runde aus der box und konnte die reifen nicht aufw rmen sie waren aus diesem grund f r die ersten paar kurven nicht bereit ich blockierte aus diesem grund die reifen in der ersten kurve
7049159 aus diesem grund konnte ich meine zeit nicht verbessern was mit sicherheit entt uschend war denn der letzte versuch ist immer der schnellste und ich konnte meine zeit nicht verbessern ich bin also letzter in der startaufstellung lasst uns sehen was morgen passiert
7049160 dies war meiner meinung nach vom team eine gute leistung und giancarlo hat im qualifying das maximum aus dem auto geholt
7049161 es ist das erste rennen mit unserem getriebe ohne zugkraftunterbrechung und ich denke dass wir in bezug auf die konkurrenzf higkeit klar einen schritt nach vorn gemacht haben es ist sch n damit zu beginnen dank der fortschritte einige der werksautos im qualifying zu schlagen
7049162 ich bin auf das team sehr stolz nun sind wir nur noch um 1 3 sekunden von der schnellsten zeit des tages entfernt und machen wirklich druck um in das mittelfeld zu kommen im hinblick auf das morgige rennen wissen wir dass es eine menge zwischenf lle und wom glich eine menge safety cars geben wird wir wissen dass unsere geschwindigkeit im rennen normalerweise besser ist als jene im qualifying meiner meinung nach k nnen wir also aufrichtig im mittelfeld fahren und auf eine potentielle m glichkeit offen in die punkte zu kommen
7049163 threatening to attack someone and their family in their home because of their race or color is offensive to our nations fundamental values
7049164 the fair housing act ensures that we can live in our homes without having to tolerate violent threats of racial intimidation
7049165 hate and intolerance tear at the very fabric of our great nation a fabric that is strengthened by its diversity of races religions and national origins

7049170 my knowledge of buddhism is rudimentary but i have to tell you that much of what i understand strikes me as wonderful and insightful and the same can be said of the teachings of muhammad though of course i have my disagreements
7049171 does it make sense for a good being to create creatures who will experience infinite torture infinite time infinite you know never be numbed in their consciousness i mean how would you even create a universe where that sort of thing could happen it just sounds it really raises some questions about the goodness of god
7049172 the traditional understanding says that god asks of us something that god is incapable of himself god asks us to forgive people but god is incapable of forgiving god cant forgive unless he punishes somebody in place of the person he was going to forgive god doesnt say things to you forgive your wife and then go kick the dog to vent your anger god asks you to actually forgive and theres a certain sense that a common understanding of the atonement presents a god who is incapable of forgiving unless he kicks somebody else
7049173 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7049174 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7049175 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
7049176 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
7049177 if you really want a winning ticket this is it
7049178 i think she has the qualifications to be president and i think she would be very strong as a campaigner so youre doing the two things that need to be done to be qualified
7049179 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
7049180 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
7049181 i really dont care who he chooses as vice president because im not going to vote for him regardless
7049182 she is such a towering personality that she could have occupied a great deal of media real estate on her own complicating obamas challenge of communicating who he is directly to the public
7049183 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
7049184 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
7049185 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
7049186 most corrupt practices were adopted to save the manmohan government
7049187 politics is like a soap opera you can be away for six months come back and you havent missed much
7049188 after the turn of events in the last ten twelve days morally and democratically i felt i should resign and that is why i handed over my resignation to the governor
7049189 that is why i felt it was right for me to submit the resignation to the governor

7049241 lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed
7049242 and the scribes and pharisees began to think saying who is this who speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
7049243 i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
7049244 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
7049245 the lords words to the apostle peter in matthew 16 19 as to binding and to all the disciples in 18 18 signify in the former case that the apostle by his ministry of the word of life would keep unbelievers outside the kingdom of god and admit those who believed

7049255 on may 13 1981 within three weeks of that private papal conference to fire arrupe john paul ii was struck by two bullets from the browning semiautomatic pistol of paid hitman mehmet ali agca by mistake as it was later explained the pontiff was rushed to the roman hospital of gemelli rather than to the special hospital unit organized solely for papal use he was given blood from the public blood bank the private supply kept in readiness was never used in rapid succession pope john paul underwent two major operations and suffered the consequences of the transfusion of impure blood he contracted a severe case of hepatitis at the height of the pontiffs crisis on may 28 cardinal wyszynski of warsaw died wyszynski was john pauls closest friend and had made his career
7049256 in some respects the meeting that convened in the middle of spring 1981 bore the marks of thousands of board meetings going on at the same moment in every daylight country of the world beyond glass paneled double doors a conference between seven men was in progress a folder bulging with reports lay in front of each man at each mans elbow a full carafe of water topped with a glass was perched anyone happening to glance in might have said that the men gathered there were absorbed in the sort of hushed but free wheeling discussion typical of board meetings everywhere but this was not the sort of meeting most people have ever witnessed or even glimpsed through shut glass paneled doors this conference room was on the third floor of the palace of the popes on vatican hill the report folders were red damask and emblazoned in gold with the tiara and keys outside the door a secretary and two swiss guards in traditional uniform were on duty to block all intruders seated at the conference table were the pontiff of the holy roman catholic church and six of his most powerful cardinals the movers and shakers of the vatican a cameo of its most formidable strength and the subject of discussion between them was the life or death of the society of jesus whether in other words the order headed by father general pedro arrupe should be allowed to go on as it was or be reorganized and reset according to the often repeated wishes of three popes or be officially done to death by the power and under the authority of pope john paul ii
7049257 a summary of this material was made generally available through the associated press which published the following short note on march 31
7049258 soon after the conclave the new pope had a talk with the 20 cardinals from latin america and was deeply impressed by the fact that most of them supported liberation theology
7049259 on the basis of paul vis critical dossier and with the help of a very experienced old jesuit father paolo dezza who had been confessor to pope paul vi and now was john paul is confessor the pope composed a hard hitting speech of warning
7049260 let it not happen that the teachings and publications of jesuits contain anything to cause confusion among the faithful
7049261 paul meanwhile was in desperate need of help of all sorts his health had been deteriorating in an operation that took place on the fourth floor of the apostolic palace in november of 1967 the pontiffs prostate gland was removed contrary to rumors there had been no metastasis more miseries of the mortal kind came from the extremely arthritic condition of pauls legs and from his cervical arthritis that last condition forced him to wear a stiff collar beneath his robes in order to lessen the pain a circumstance that saved his life during his visit to manila the kris wielded by the bolivian painter and would be papal assassin benjamin amor y mendoza was sharp enough to have severed pauls jugular veins as mendoza slashed twice once to the right and once to the left side of pauls neck had it not been for that stiff collar and the speed of pauls private secretary monsignore macchi who caught mendozas arm and slowed its force paul would have been killed as it was he was wounded slightly on both sides of the neck

7049276 in selecting senator joe biden as his running mate senator obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of senator bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career if the support senator biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that senator obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser
7049277 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7049311 biden ha denunciado el pobre juicio de pol tica exterior de obama y ha argumentado con fuerza en sus propias palabras lo que los estadunidenses se est n dando cuenta que barack obama no est listo para ser presidente
7049312 biden lleva al equipo dem crata peso en asuntos que van desde la guerra en irak hasta el actual conflicto entre rusia y georgia

7049316 va da ando gravemente la democracia la naturaleza y la participaci n social de las personas para hacer valer sus derechos y levantar discursos ticos frente a una pol tica depredadora del ser humano ante la naturaleza
7049317 esta estructura de poder debiera ser motivo de reflexi n para que no vivi ramos en un tiempo de nuevo colonialismo que valoremos la soberan a que tenemos el terreno en que vivimos y los bienes naturales porque aqu hay un deber de estado que no se ha hecho responsable de la b squeda de pol ticas energ ticas definidas y deja esta pol tica en manos de privados quienes buscando una mayor rentabilidad para ellos y no para el bien com n van imponiendo proyectos que son gravemente da inos e irreparables para todo el pueblo chileno

7049331 wow yeah this makes sense and this is exactly what i want to do
7049332 what do you want to do i dont know what do you want to do
7049333 well there are about 8 interesting things going on this weekend
7049334 and macenstein questions the accelerometers ability rotate on a flat
7049335 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study
7049336 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
7049337 slams into gear sometimes and then sometimes it slides out of gear the back in
7049338 i didnt mean it that way i just meant i am having a bad summer sorry if it was put off as mean or something
7049339 but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence
7049340 if the bible is not true and authoritative on the roles of men and women then maybe the bible will not be finally true on premarital sex the homosexual issue adultery or any other moral issue
7049341 i believe this issue is the carrier of a virus by which liberalism will enter the evangelical church
7049342 taking this step has kind of rattled a lot of peoples cages
7049343 were culturally and historically specific not universal principles for all times and places
7049344 an ethic in progress leading to full freedom for women to exercise their giftedness in the local church
7049345 there are great theologians in the conservative evangelical world who come down on both sides
7049346 i do want us to be loving in our disagreement theres something powerful in that
7049347 whether hes gay or not he is the gay elvis he is among the greatest entertainers of our time the banter the dancing the stage craft it all conspires and you know exactly what morrissey is he is heroic he is a total package like dean martin or prince
7049348 its our best olympics since 1996 when we won the two gold medals donovan bailey and the sprint relay and even there besides the medals the percentage of top finishes was not as good
7049349 we had eight athletes in the top 12 and 11 in the top 16
7049350 at the end of the day i have to be happy with the finish and the 10 year process to get here
7049351 my body let me get to the finals i knew i only had one good throw in me early and then things started to break down on me
7049352 having got our nose in front of the off colour wizards from oz the battle now is to keep it there
7049353 they argue with umpires they cheer when theyve won and practice beforehand which ruins the fun
7049354 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

7049363 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action

7049370 if i were to ignore that 10 day rule then weve got guantanamo bay wed never have counsel i could keep them in jail forever and theyd never have a trial because we cant take them to trial without counsel
7049371 the fundamental duty of the judiciary is to protect public safety it is incomprehensible that judge popovich would release an individual who he acknowledges is dangerous because of his failure to conduct a timely preliminary hearing the judge has at his disposal the statutory authority to protect the public and a full investigation should be conducted by the judicial removal and retirement commission as to his rash actions disregarding the public safety and his bizarre explanation thereof

7049389 the election commission on friday set september 6 as the date lawmakers will elect a new president after the resignation earlier this week of president pervez musharraf
7049390 the senior party in pakistans governing coalition on friday nominated asif ali zardari widower of former prime minister benazir bhutto as its candidate in elections for president the announcement of the election date came a day after twin suicide attacks outside the countrys biggest weapons factory complex in wah 20 miles north of the capital islamabad
7049391 he has one of the worlds most dangerous jobs turning back the seemingly unstoppable tide of and taliban linked jihadi militancy sweeping across nuclear armed pakistan
7049392 and rehman malik photo above as we talk in his islamabad office makes it clear that the days of pussyfooting in pakistans fight against the militants are over
7049393 either we can hand this country over to the taliban or we can fight i am going to fight under malik pakistans policy has been transformed from one of retreat to pursuit of and the taliban but his tough rhetoric has also him a target of islamic militants
7049394 the suave 57 year old one time boss of pakistans federal investigation agency the equivalent of the australian federal police is an increasingly controversial figure as he takes pakistans war into areas it has previously avoided
7049395 in the few short weeks since malik and prime minister gilani returned from the white house pakistans much vaunted role in the war against terrorism has been transformed
7049396 suddenly and with little fanfare islamabads security forces are aggressively on the offensive in key areas where for months if not years the government had virtually given up leaving the militants to set up sharia courts
7049397 benazir bhutto appointed rehman malik as chief of the federal investigation agency fia which then launched a secret war against the taliban supporters in pakistan which amounted to a direct attack on the inter services intelligence isi
7049398 the pakistani military was equally dismayed by reports of fia contacts with the israeli secret service the mossad which had been cooperating with indian secret service raw to investigate taliban supporters on 5 november 1996 ghulam asghar head of fia and rehman malik the additional director general fia were arrested
7049399 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly

7049408 in the long run the solution to each is restoring the most basic of all resources the soil
7049409 it must be one of the greatest wastes of human labor in history
7049410 tens of millions of people forced to work night and day on projects that a child could have seen were a terrible stupidity

7049494 we are disappointed that 12 years of peace negotiations between the milf and grp can be swept away by unconcerned so called national politicians who have never proposed any concrete form of governance structures that can respond to the moro aspiration for right to self determination
7049495 these lawless acts are in violation of islam international humanitarian laws and conventions protecting children and women from the wrath of war
7049496 nasty rumors accusing us of being silent on the human rights violations in mindanao
7049497 for the record we wish to reiterate our stand that we do not condone atrocities committed by elements of the milf
7049498 lastly we also call on both sides especially government to let peace missions and human rights workers go about their work unhampered

7049500 there has been an increase in the number of affluent consumers compared to before
7049501 we target the new rich who have enough money to keep using the cream at this price on a long term basis
7049502 they would like to invest in themselves in something invisible to stand apart from others
7049503 japanese women are the worlds longest living and as woman they spend money on staying beautiful for as long as they can
7049504 they said i look younger making an effort leads to a good result the same goes for skin care products

7049509 in the presence of god and of christ jesus who will judge the living and the dead and in view of his appearing and his kingdom i give you this charge preach the word be prepared in season and out of season correct rebuke and encourage with great patience and careful instruction for the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine instead to suit their own desires they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear they will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths but you keep your head in all situations endure hardship do the work of an evangelist discharge all the duties of your ministry for i am already being poured out like a drink offering and the time has come for my departure i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing
7049510 im already be poured out like a drink offering and the time has come for my departure the word paul employs is the same as is used to describe oxen unyoked at the end of the day like one who weighs anchor and heads for the final destination or an individual striking tent and heading home in view of my passing timothy i want you to do this

7049515 today the evangelical church is in a life and death struggle with this spiritual alternative even as the apostles in the new testament period today this pagan spirituality comes in sophisticated psychological language it sounds plausible compelling and even commendable but let us make no mistake about it it is lethal to biblical christianity that is why the biggest enigma we face today is the fact that its chief enablers are evangelical churches
7049516 let no one among you think of himself more highly than he ought but each with sober judgment according to the grace that has been given to us
7049517 some will love thee some will hate thee some will praise thee some will slight cease from man and look above thee trust in god and do whats right

7049520 and honored by a high and holy calling let me never forget that i am but a man of dust and ashes a man with all the natural faults and passions that plague the race of man i pray you therefore my lord and my redeemer save me from myself and from all the injuries i may do myself while endeavoring to bless others fill me with your power by the holy spirit and i will go in strength and tell of your righteousness i will spread abroad the message of redeeming love while my earthly life shall last

7049620 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7049621 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7049622 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7049623 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7049624 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7049625 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices
7049626 they need to send me a bill next month that i can sign so we can bring relief to drivers small business owners farmers and ranchers and every american affected by high prices at the pump

7049643 when a republican wears a little american flag lapel pin what is he trying to say
7049644 why did the vietnamese shoot down john mccain and put him in prison for five years he seems like such a nice guy
7049645 mccains sacrifice had nothing to do with protecting the united states he was sent to vietnam along with hundreds of thousands of others in an attempt to prop up what was essentially an american colony south vietnam which was being run by a dictator whom we installed
7049646 that had we taken the war to the north and made full consistent use of air power in the north we ultimately would have prevailed
7049647 is it morally right to drop bombs and missiles in a heavily populated area where hundreds if not thousands of civilians will perish
7049648 because johns father was the naval commander in the pacific theater he was exploited with tv interviews while wounded
7049649 i can verify that john has an infamous reputation for being a hot head

7049653 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7049654 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7049655 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7049656 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7049657 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7049658 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7049659 far too many elderly or disabled americans cant get the help they need in their home and community home and community based services are high quality cost effective and help many people live independent lives but medicaid continues to favor nursing homes its a problem when the nations largest purchaser of long term care services is tilted towards nursing homes rather than home and community based services this bill will level the playing field and give families real choices to care for their loved ones and give cash strapped states new tools to provide cost effective long term care options to the most vulnerable
7049660 being able to live at home greatly improves quality of life because people can be with loved ones and have the dignity that goes with greater independence
7049661 this bill encourages states to help make that possible which is also fiscally smart because institutional care is the most expensive form of long term care that medicaid pays for this bill also empowers individuals to manage the financial burdens that come with caregiving needs
7049662 youve been in this way too long and its time to come out

7049669 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
7049670 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7049671 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7049672 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7049673 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7049674 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws

7049681 unspecified human remains and enough minuscule pieces of plane debris to fill one third of a dumpster
7049682 if the people knew what we had done they would chase us down the street and lynch us

7049719 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7049720 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7049721 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7049722 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
7049723 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7049724 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7049725 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7049726 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7049727 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birth date
7049728 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe

7049730 if you trust every web site but not a government
7049731 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7049732 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7049733 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7049734 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes

7049763 mccain promises that his fiscal plan will lower deficits not raise them because he will be austere on the spending side of the ledger
7049764 his mantra on the campaign trail is that he will veto wasteful spending and make the authors of such bills

7049843 in selecting senator joe biden as his running mate senator obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7049844 senator bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career
7049845 we only need to look back to the recent passage of the repeal of the hiv travel and immigration ban to see the type of leadership we can expect from senator biden on the issues important to our community
7049846 it was because of his determination and tenacity that we were able to see this relic of discrimination against people living with hiv aids torn down
7049847 if the support senator biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that senator obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser
7049848 the homosexual movement threatens the strength and survival of the american family
7049849 just three guys looking like they might be playing baseball
7049850 i just feel blessed to have an opportunity to play pro ball
7049851 its just been a dream of mine my whole life i only packed for a couple of days i just have to do laundry every three or four days and ill be all right i think i can make it two weeks
7049852 we had some decisions to make and it was perfect timing for them and the same for us its a little bit of a tryout for them for next year we want guys who are going to come in hungry
7049853 stancil flew in from georgia heimpel drove in from pennsylvania and they had to change their plans when we said ok were going to put you on the bus on tuesday
7049854 it was a lot of fun my first professional experience a bunch of good guys here said heimpel who after a tough senior year at gc 3 4 7 85 era struck out five in two innings of relief work for the pride the other night giving up a run
7049855 i got a call to come down and try out
7049856 and give it a shot and made it they told me to pack some clothes for the trip it is surprising this late into the summer you know
7049857 these guys are eager to play and we want to see what they can do
7049858 we got a chance to look at all three up in ottawa it was a good chance for that to happen
7049859 right now you start looking for next year a little bit and you want to get some good rookies in here
7049860 wherever i go i want to win and i always want to play hard
7049861 and do whatever i can to help the team win
7049862 i used to help with the fungo and chasing balls down all the time now ill be sharing first base coaching duties thats not hard
7049863 ive always been just a thrower and coming here every day im learning how to pitch its a nice thing its nice to have teammates that want to help you and want to teach you and hopefully one day i can get back on a team
7049864 he took some swings and still feels a little tender
7049865 weve got to figure out and get to a point where i dont want to miss any more time it could be better tomorrow it could be better on sunday
7049866 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
7049867 its tough because when i sit down and get relaxed i try to stand up and im stiff and its hard to get moving
7049868 he actually threw the ball pretty well we just want to make sure we do the right thing
7049869 it didnt get worse but at the same time hes not going to go back out there and resume what he was doing hes going to get treatment his range of motion was good but youre not going to see him running around and catching grounders either its definitely a setback how far of a setback i just dont know
7049870 that was more than 20 years ago and people still say hey i saw the saturday night live skit
7049871 we do it because we love it and theres enough satisfaction in it for us

7049874 our country is very focused on football basketball and baseball
7049875 when we go to japan people go nuts for synchro a venue like this one here would be sold out wall to wall for the world championships when we go to europe its the same way its really only the americas
7049876 the playful part the death and then the rebirth at the end we were trying to show every kind of emotion
7049877 it needs to be visible from very far away there cant be a lot of stuff on it just one idea thats really big it also depends on whether youre indoors or outdoors you sparkle a whole lot more outdoors than indoors
7049878 its hard not to get upset about things you cant control
7049879 its that first impression if you didnt have the most amazing deck pose i dont think that would really make a difference but a lot of times youre setting up a theme or a mood while showing some flexibility or strength its just a bonus deal
7049880 we perform to music and if you have music you have art but today all my muscles ached were completely numb except for the ones in my brain so i dont know how they could kick us out of the olympics
7049881 at the last olympics when davydova was undergoing a doping test someone said but why would you need doping for synchro
7049882 i dont think people understand how hard it is to do what we do they should be put underwater to see how hard it is
7049883 thats what good blockers do when they get on a roll good luck to you
7049884 i knew i had to play the game of my life to keep us in this
7049885 its my best game as of yet but theres more to come youll see
7049886 thomas and i are going to get into the finals and dive our best and not worry about medals
7049887 im just thanking god over and over and over so thankful i want to cry
7049888 and kind of showed everyone that the sport is really awesome
7049889 playing for bronze isnt what we came here for but its what were doing now
7049890 we want to bring home a medal we dont want to leave here empty handed japans thinking the same thing
7049891 im not a guy to complain ill get back in the gym to work and get better
7049892 in brazil theres a lot of pressure about the gold always winning
7049893 we didnt get to the final but in the end we won the bronze which is also important
7049894 every athlete wants to win the gold in china and im from beijing and i won the gold and the top three are all from the chinese team
7049895 the russians perform from their hearts no matter what we do we do it with heart and soul
7049896 this is actually more like the government acting like a banker as it begins to look at the major consequences of a major failure in the auto industry
7049897 all i can say is yo jamaican sprinters are taking over the world

7049902 we do not restrict access to our exams for anyone applying for initial certification or maintenance of certification based on whether they do or do not perform an abortion
7049903 we do not base this upon whether they do or do not refer patients to an abortion provider if they do not choose to do abortions
7049904 both shocked and very dismayed at the grossly untrue and unfair allegation
7049905 action by the american board of obstetrics and gynecology had the potential to force physicians to either violate their conscience by referring patients for abortions or taking other objectionalbe actions or risk losing their board certification
7049906 the american board of obstetrics and gynecology has taken no stand pro or con against individual physicians who choose to or choose not to perform abortions or to refer patients to abortion providers
7049907 intent and full implications of any proposed regulations governing conscience rights may be fully understood
7049908 a public forum in which the allegations against the abog may be refuted and will offer an opportunity for a complete consideration of the implications of the conduct the regulation would impact including but not limited to considerations of malpractice liability and the implications on womens health care

7049912 i certainly dont know what he obama believes in the only foreign policy thing i remember he said was hes going to attack pakistan and embrace ahmadinejad
7049913 this is one of the most deadly viruses known to man
7049914 it has a mortality rate in horses of over 70 not counting the current people in hospital 50 of previous human cases have died it is a high level containment category virus that is only studied in laboratories under the strictest of biocontainment protocols hence it is not something to play around with
7049915 acting on garc as instructions to retaliate for the october 2 assassination of an apra leader cosepap a secret apra branch recently botched an attempted bombing of a pro sl sendero luminoso newspaper
7049916 the garc a administration operates a secret paramilitary organisation perhaps several
7049917 so compartmentalised that many apra officials are unaware of its existence
7049918 reportedly has agreed to send 1 000 of its members to north korea for training by 1989 about 300 have been there already
7049919 close associates of president garc a apra senator armando villanueva and alberto kitasono apra organisational secretary apparently direct cosepap
7049920 garc as vice interior minister agust n mantilla supervises a secret police force that is armed with interior ministry weapons
7049921 mantilla reportedly believes that apra needs the capability to eliminate terrorists because of the judicial systems tendency to release them and police reluctance to kill captured sl militants
7049922 although the paramilitary units appear now to act only against terrorists the specter of apra violence is unnerving garc as political rivals opposition congressmen tried to censure the interior minister for his suspected role in the attempted kidnapping of a leftist congressman with alleged sl ties
7049923 after garc a ordered that apra congressmen be briefed about their partys self defence units they used apras legislative majority to support the minister
7049924 but garc as reputation as a human rights crusader was tarnished
7049925 exactly who in the armed forces knows what about the paramilitary squads is unclear
7049926 the vice interior minister claims that army intelligence assisted his anti terrorist squad even as the navy was investigating it
7049927 vigilantism will further weaken his standing with the military and political opposition
7049928 military leaders probably are delighted by garc as loss of the moral high ground which lessens pressure on them to be concerned about human rights abuses but those perpetual coup plotters in the military who are aware of apras sponsorship of paramilitary groups must also be aware these could be used to raise the costs of any attempted move against the regime
7049929 obviously they had some high ranking inside source providing them this information
7049930 google has been reaping the benefits from mr wexlers invention without paying him a penny
7049931 and this lawsuit will allow him to claim what is rightfully his
7049932 because patent cases are so expensive if it were not for companies like web tracking solutions individual inventors like mr wexler would not have the means to stand up to giant corporations like google

7049963 and that has to do with how we feel about the nazis not about the work of olympic officials order probe into chinese gymnasts age voice of america
7049964 slams into gear sometimes and then sometimes it slides out of gear the back in
7049965 for sydney the first qualification class was the toughest and i didnt make the qualifications then someone who qualified ahead of me went to sydney and won the gold
7049966 but people in thailand told me i still had fight left in me so i went back to training and now ive got the gold medal
7049967 even though i would like to have had the gold medal the silver is satisfactory
7049968 i am the first thai to win medals in consecutive games
7049969 it wasnt such a surprise to lose my opponent fought very good today and i accept it
7049970 especially when my score did not go up after three clear punches
7049971 in greece i managed to get there and i lost to a cuban i thought i was at my peak of my career then the right age and right fitness so that was really hard but people in thailand told me i still had fight left in me so i went back to training and now ive got the gold medal
7049972 even though i would like to have had the gold medal the silver is satisfactory
7049973 i am the first thai to win medals in consecutive games
7049974 it wasnt such a surprise to lose my opponent fought very good today and i accept it

7049976 right now we have a lot of young people on our island where they would like to pursue a higher education and yet they dont know how and where to go about it and what theyre going to do first

7049978 you have got to give us a home field advantage we go out there to warm up nobodys there get into the dadgum game and start making some noise and get that other team intimidated thats what we need
7049979 its been a strange season this year i know ive been able to get those distances but its just not been there until today it was just the perfect time to get a big one
7049980 there is always pressure but the olympics feel similar to other championships i have been part of so many that i know how to handle the pressure
7049981 i was very happy it was beyond my expectation i didnt expect to get a medal before the competition let alone a silver
7049982 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7049983 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition
7049984 the olympics are a prism for the conflicts emotions and tendencies that are being worked out and worked out in public
7049985 hoped to show the world a china that after 30 years of rapid development has not been seen in hundreds of years
7049986 cheering for foreign teams would have been unimaginable four years ago much less 20 years ago
7049987 this is the beauty of dictatorship they can do many things that other countries cannot do
7049988 you have to remember they even controlled the weather no other country would do this

7049996 somehow or another it caused the 911 system to crash
7049997 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3 p m et on spread the word
7049998 i would have played for the friday evening news and then the saturday event which leaves you the sunday papers and the talk shows
7049999 this kind of stuff is awfully hard to manage and the campaign managed to keep it pretty tight to the vest for a couple of days
